Budget Transmi al Le er
Cuyahoga County con nues to live within its means and invest in what ma ers
to sa sfy the needs of our community while contending with challenges
including: uncertain economic condi ons, substan al reduc ons in State
assistance and increased demand for vital County services. The goal of the 2012
– 2013 opera ng budget plan is to maintain a solid financial founda on that is
essen al to all services and func ons that the County provides, especially since
revenues available for services will remain flat in 2014. The Budget Plan for the
next biennium is balanced in its programma c and financial components.
The next budget biennium will challenge us to explore new ways to maintain
cri cal County services while implemen ng a more strategic approach to
service delivery. The primary challenge facing Cuyahoga County, as well as the
region remains enhancing and crea ng economic development opportuni es
that create jobs. Cuyahoga County will con nue to re-evaluate its core mission
and define its guiding principles and departmental boundaries by collec vely
evalua ng and measuring program performance and outcomes.
The values that guided the development of the 2012-2013 budget were:
 Improve opera onal eﬃciency, remove redundant ac vi es and reduce
costs

 We will sustain our natural resources
 Enforcement of laws will be fair and mely
The above objec ves were achieved. In the 2012-2013 biennial opera ng
budget, the total general fund opera ng budget was $701.5 million, but the
actual expenditures came in at $705.00 million which was 0.4% more than
projected, which represents rela vely flat expenditures. The implementa on
of the Western Reserve Plan with $100 million of funding behind the plan
helped to encourage and strengthen our economy, improve coordina on, and
promote innova on. There were improvements in the intake process for the
Department of Senior and Adult Services, which improved senior’s access to
services. Investment in workforce eﬀorts are 17.6% greater than the previous
year and the College Savings Account Program was implemented to posi on
our children for success. The County has con nued to be diligent about law
enforcement, including implemen ng the Sheriﬀ ’s community policing and
impact units to improve safety throughout the County. The County con nues to
recycle and take ecologically sound steps to help sustain our natural resources
including the construc on of the new County Administra on building to be
completed in July 2014.
The values that guided the development of the 2014-2015 biennium budget
are:

 Encourage opportunity and strengthen our economy
 Be excellent stewards of county assets

 Support economic development and job crea on as defined in the Western Reserve Fund

 Improve coordina on and promote innova on
 Ci zens, especially seniors, unable to help themselves will receive help
 Ci zens will have access to resources needed to be skilled and produc ve

 Con nue eﬀorts to improve eﬃciency in County government and direct
savings to strategic priori es while using resources in a manner that produces measurable outcomes
 Maintain cri cal programs and services to protect and support vulnerable
popula ons in Cuyahoga County in spite of local and State revenue

 Our ci zens will be healthy
 Our children will be well cared for and safe

 Improve educa on for the County’s children through con nued investment in early childhood programs and through the Cuyahoga County College Savings Account Program

 Our County will be a safe place to live and raise a family

Budget Transmi al Le er
The objec ves of the 2014-2015 opera ng budget plan include:
 Using resources in a manner that produces measurable outcomes
 Alloca ng resources to fund priori es and strategic ini a ves
 Con nual refinement of staﬃng levels in Execu ve agencies
 Balancing es mated resources with programma c expenditures
 Addressing structural imbalances in both the General Fund and the Health
& Human Services(HHS) Levy fund
 Contending with lower levels of State and Federal revenue for the foreseeable future
 Incorpora ng impacts of approved organiza onal changes and opera ng
funds
 Implementa on of the new County Headquarters and improved space
strategy
 Submission of updates five year capital improvement plan that iden fies
priority investments
The County’s 2014-2015 General Fund budget is $758.7 million for the next
biennium and includes the impact of reduc ons in expenditures and right sizing
staﬃng levels that have been implemented since 2011. When comparing
this Budget to previous Budgets we compare our plan for 2014-2015 with the
opera ng budget for 2012-2013, the last biennial. The changes implemented
since 2011 and the associated savings have been carried through into the 20142015 biennial budget. The General Fund opera ng budget of $377.2 million
for 2014 represents a 6.5% increase in comparable ongoing opera ons from
2013. The opera ng budget for 2015 of $381.5 million con nues to increase
ongoing opera ng expenditures of 1.1% from 2014.

The Health & Human Services Levy Fund budget of $471.2 million includes
increased levels of support for the County’s cri cal Health and Human Service
programs. The $230.6 million in local funding of human services in 2014
includes con nued funding for public assistance programs and health & safety
programs. The 2015 level of funding of $230.2 million maintains consistency
in support despite the loss of State revenue to the Levy Fund. The increase
in expended Levy dollars is the result of the successful passage of the Health
and Human Services Levy in November 2013. In addi on, the County will
con nue using a por on of its reserve in the public assistance funds to oﬀset
the required subsidy used to fund human service budgets.
County resources have been reduced over the past several years but the
demand for core services has not.
Like other local governments Cuyahoga County’s revenue streams are sensi ve
to economic condi ons. During the most recent recessionary period the
County’s General Fund revenue base decreased by over $46 million or 12.6%
compared to the pre-recessionary level. Over the past year some revenue
sources such as sales tax have grown modestly in comparison to the prior year
levels. Even with this growth collec ons from sales tax have not recovered
to the peak level in 2008 when infla on is taken into account. The depth of
the economic down turn required the State of Ohio to reduce its support to
local governments, including Cuyahoga County, to balance its budget. The
revenue es mates used to prepare the County’s budget for 2014-2015 include
the impacts of State revenue cuts that reduce prior levels of support to the
General Fund and other county funds by over $24.6 million compared to
the previous biennium budget period. The majority of the loss is focused in
the General Fund ($6.2 million) and the Health & Human Services Levy Fund
($14.9 million) over the next two years and is assumed to remain in place as
permanently lower levels of funding. As a result of the declining revenue
trends and cuts in State assistance the County has become more reliant on
a few major sources including sales tax and property tax. In 2008 sales tax
and property tax collec ons accounted for about 54% of general fund revenue
and by 2013 these two sources account for 70% of opera ng revenue. This
decrease in revenue diversifica on can pose a weakness for long-term growth

Budget Transmi al Le er
if the other sources do not increase in the future and round out the available
revenue for funding opera ons.

Use of other eﬃciencies to maintain balance include organiza onal
restructuring and streamlining opera ons.

The savings realized since 2011 as a result of reorganiza on, right-sizing, and
opera onal changes have been carried into the 2014-2015 opera ng budget.

The change in governance structure approved by the voters of Cuyahoga County
in 2009 and manifested with the elec on of the County’s first Execu ve in
2010 has provided the opportunity to make wide reaching changes to the way
resources are allocated across County programs, oﬃces and departments. The
por on of the County budget and staﬀ under direc on of the County Execu ve
is now over 60%. This realignment has enabled restructuring of major func ons
of the County that resulted in substan al savings and reduces staﬃng levels.
Budgetary savings from organiza onal consolida ons in fiscal management
and public works that were ini ated since 2011 are carried into this biennium.
The alignment of the County’s fiscal opera on into a unified management
structure alone will result in savings of approximately $1.7 million. The fiscal
reorganiza on includes increases in staﬃng for the Microfilming Center, which
will result in an opera on that will save millions of dollars for microfilming
projects within the County and the region. Other reorganiza ons in Jus ce
Services, Public Works and Human Resources will not only reduce costs but
will increase produc vity and improve the management of these func ons
of County government. The spending plan also incorporates the cost savings
related to suppor ng opera ons. The restructuring of employee health care
plans will allow the County to provide sustainable health care to employees
and reduce the County’s spending on health care in the next biennium by
almost $5 million a year which will help oﬀset the infla onary impacts related
to this expense.

A comparison can be made by assuming the 2010 actual level of General Fund
expenditures (less one- me expenses) is used as a baseline for the previous
structure of government. In 2010 ongoing General Fund expenditures were
$296.7 million and now stand at $153.9 million in the 2014 budget. For agency
budgets that are now under the direc on of the County Execu ve the levels
of ongoing opera ng expenditures have decreased by $8.9 million or 6.0% in
2014 as compared to that opera onal group in 2010. These savings are net
of one- me expenditures and transfers to other funds, projects (Global Center
for Health Innova on), and the informa on technology reorganiza on. On an
All Funds basis the decrease in ongoing opera ng expenses is 4.9 % or $41.2
million in 2014.
Staﬃng levels declined on a County-wide basis.
Staﬃng levels in agencies that are under the County Execu ve had declined
7.6% by the end of 2011. This reduc on in staﬀ results in net annual budgetary
savings of approximately $22.4 million related to approximately 385 staﬃng
cuts that have been achieved through layoﬀs, termina ons, re rements and
resigna ons. Some of the posi ons eliminated have not been filled and the
savings a ributable to these staﬃng reduc ons are carried through the 2014
and 2015 budgets. The budgeted staﬃng level is maintained at this lower
level (compared to 2010) in 2015. On a county-wide basis, levels of staﬃng
under the new form of government are approximately 2% lower than the base
level in 2010. The opera onal review of the staﬃng levels included in agency
budgets is ongoing and addi onal changes will be implemented in addi on to
the reduc ons already achieved based on this review process.

The County’s Budget plan will leverage the exis ng level of resource to make
strategic investments in the community.
The Budget maintains alloca ons for new ini a ves that were made since 2011
as part of the strategic investments implemented by the County Execu ve.
The opera ng budget includes over $6.0 million in funding for new programs
including the College Savings Account Program (CSA), the community policing
ini a ve, Early Childhood programs, Regional Crime Lab and Emergency
Management. These alloca ons are being provided with exis ng sources of

Budget Transmi al Le er
funding in the proposed spending plan. Resources will be devoted to increasing
the County’s investment in local economic development and job crea on. The
Western Reserve fund was established within the opera ng budget and will
leverage General Fund dollars and County bonding capacity to con nue to
fund $100 million of economic development projects. Addi onal investments
will be made to create produc vity gains within County opera ons specifically
in the areas of technology and equipment. There is available reserve within
the General fund to make investments unifying communica ons and data
management throughout the County.
Biennial Budget Process
The budget development process was modified to comply with the new biennial
budget ordinance. The County has been developing mul year opera ng
budgets for some me, but the shi to a formal biennial budget adop on
required some technical changes and repor ng redesign work to accomplish
the objec ves set forth in the new policy. County Council is adjus ng their
mid-period budget review to be even more eﬃcient a er evalua ng the
process from the first biennium.

Looking to the future
Cuyahoga County has not only managed through a stalled economy and faced
numerous changes in the past year it has put itself on a course for renewed
prosperity. We are op mis c as we look to the future. We enjoy strong
rela onships with various community partners that are cri cal to eﬀec vely
serving our residents, especially those most in need. We have a corporate
sector ac vely engaged in eﬀorts to be er our region, grow our local economy
and create jobs. We have a generous philanthropic sector, which includes the
second largest community founda on in the United States. We have a well
developed nonprofit sector that assists in serving those most in need. We have
educa onal ins tu ons that help develop our work force.
We are all working together to make Cuyahoga County a great place to live,
work and do business. Our pledge is to con nue our eﬀorts to serve you in the
most cost-eﬀec ve and eﬃcient manner possible. The Charter provides us a
unique opportunity in Cuyahoga County government to correct the problems
of the past and work toward a brighter future for all Cuyahoga residents. As
you review the 2014-2015 Budget I hope you agree that our commitment to
improve the quality of services, while ensuring those in need are served, is
possible with the Budget adopted by Council on December 3, 2013.

Fund Cash Reserves
Respec ully,
The General Fund 2014 available ending cash fund balance is es mated at
$116.6 million, which is 30.9% of the es mated expenditure level is s ll above
the stated budgetary policy of maintaining 25% cash balance of the an cipated
annual expenditures. This policy is intended to ensure fiscal viability in the
future while assuring essen al services are sustained.
The Human Service Levy Fund ending cash balance is es mated at $29.7 million
in 2014 which is 12.6% of the excepted expenditure level. Levy Fund revenue
is expected to remain stable based on current property values and current
collec on rates.



In addi on, we were also able to provide funding for the following:

maintain and expand programs that are vital for the well-being of many
of our residents. Investments in our children’s educa on will set them

In summary, the budget provides $1.30 billion per year for all of the
County’s elected oﬃcials, agencies, departments and programs. About
$381 million is generated from the General Fund, funded mostly by sales
and property taxes. The Health and Human Services levies contribute
$230 million annually, while the remainder revenue coming primarily

Ci zens’ Summary
Profile of Cuyahoga County
Loca on
Located on the shores of Lake Erie, Cuyahoga County spans 457.2 square
miles (U.S. Census Bureau) and is home to a diversity of cultures and people.
Cuyahoga is the most heavily populated county in Ohio, topping out at over
1.28 million residents as of the 2010 U.S. census. Its residents took the county’s
name for the Indian word “Cuyahoga “or “crooked river”. The Cuyahoga River
provided a trade route for American Indians. The area was originally part of
the Connec cut Western Reserva on and Moses Cleaveland brought New
England se lers in 1796 and established the City of Cleveland that same year.
The Western Reserve became a part of the newly created Ohio territory. By
January 1803, Ohio’s popula on exceeded the required 60,000 for statehood
and on March of that year was granted status as the 17th state. During its early
development, one of the most important and vexing problems of Ohio was the
forma on of new coun es.
As the state was sparsely populated, Ohio
created several large “parent” coun es and
would form new coun es from these based
upon popula on numbers. Trumbull County
was the first created in the Western Reserve
region and encompassed all of its territory.
In 1806, Geauga County was formed from
Trumbull, in 1808 the Ohio General Assembly
formed Cuyahoga County from Geauga. It was
not un l January 1810 that the new county
became fully independent from Geauga. This
became eﬀec ve in May of 1810. The Village
of Cleaveland (as it was called prior to 1831)
was selected as the county’s seat. 1810 also saw county business being
first conducted at Public Square as well as the elec on of Jabez Wright and
Nathaniel Doane, the county’s first two commissioners. Philo Taylor joined this
group in 1813, forming a triumvirate of commissioners, a system that remained
in place un l the change to Charter government in 2011. In addi on to this,
a two-story frame combina on jail, courthouse, and administra on building
were built in 1813 as well.

As Cleveland’s prosperity began to rise, so did
the County’s. Borders of the municipali es
in the county began to see drama c change,
especially with the expansion of Cleveland.
Facili es in the county also began to grow
and expand. In 1828, 1858, 1875, and 1912,
new courthouses were built. Moreover, a
new administra on building was built in
1955, a new Jus ce Center in 1976, and an
addi onal jail in 1995. A new Juvenile Jus ce
Center opened in 2011 and a new County
Administra on building will open in 2014 which will incorporate various
services that were previously sca ered among various loca ons.
Like other industrial ci es, Cleveland saw a steady decline in the 1960s and
more people began moving to other municipali es in the county. Cleveland’s
suburbs such as Bay Village, Cleveland Heights, Euclid, Fairview Park, Garfield
Heights, Lakewood, Parma, Rocky River, and Shaker Heights began to have rapid
growth over the decades. Addi onally, the region’s growing income disparity
resulted in regionalizing some of its assets throughout the en re county.
Government
The Cuyahoga County seat is located in the City of Cleveland and is a Charter
form of government headed by an elected County Execu ve and an eleven
member elected County Council. The County has significant responsibili es in
the areas of general government, administra on of jus ce, road and bridge
maintenance, health care, public assistance and social services. The County
operates wastewater collec on and treatment facili es, water lines, parking
facili es, a hospital, an airport and a computer informa on system for law
enforcement agencies in the County.
Ci es, villages and townships in the County, together with the various
special districts and other governmental en es opera ng in the County,
are responsible for many local governmental services and make significant
expenditures to provide such services to County residents.

Cuyahoga County’s Mission Statement

Cuyahoga County government improves public health and safety, advances our economic and
environmental vitality and promotes self-suﬃciency through the produc ve investment of
public resources
Despite accomplishing many goals and receiving na onal acclaim and awards
for our innova ve eﬀorts, Cuyahoga County con nues to face many challenges.
The pressure to reduce and control expenses has become relentless. Cuyahoga
County is not alone in this struggle. School districts, public libraries, municipali es na onwide and other coun es throughout Ohio are facing similar circumstances. In addi on to the majority of our revenue streams declining, the
major factors contribu ng to the financial pressures are escala ng healthcare
costs for employees and for uncompensated care at our public hospital (MetroHealth System), a shrinking tax base, increases in the cost and delivery of
goods due to the increase in energy costs, unfunded state and federal mandates, and the fact that historically our local economy has trailed the na on’s
economic performance.
Northeast Ohio’s recovery from the Great Recession of 2008 again trailed the
na on’s recovery. The popula on con nues to decline and the number of families and individuals with incomes below the poverty level remains higher than
the na onal average. The struggling economy has aﬀected the largest two
sources of General Fund dollars. The Sales & Use Tax and the Property Tax provide 40% and 38% of General Fund resources respec vely in the 2014 budget.
Cuyahoga County receives 27% of its all funds revenues from property taxes in
the 2014 budget, and the local real estate market compared with the rest of
the na on declined earlier and has not yet rebounded. Cuyahoga County completed a full sexennial real estate reappraisal in 2012 and saw declines of 6.0%
in commercial and industrial and 8.7% for residen al values with an average
decrease of 8.2% per parcel. This follows property reduc ons of approximately
eight percent in the 2009 triennial reappraisal.

II-6

The 2014-2015 biennial budget focuses on ensuring fiscal viability in the future
while assuring essen al county services are sustained and expenditure growth
is controlled. We are commi ed to challenging agencies to use new tac cs
and technologies to improve service coordina on and eﬃciency to achieve
be er results in our service delivery provision. The County expectscon nued
commitment of all par es to take the necessary steps to assure services are
delivered eﬃciently. Current private-public partnerships will have to con nue
and the willingness to explore diﬀerent modes of opera ng will have to be
embraced internally and by the community. The County needs to con nue
bringing about eﬃciencies in order to aﬀord to sustain the provision of services
at current levels without the future revenue picture changing.
One example of a private-public partnership that the County will pursue in the
2014-2015 budget is Pay for Success to use private and philanthropic dollars
to pay for preven ve services to reduce the need for foster care. Under this
model, private investors and founda ons pay for the cost of providing services.
If the services are successful, the County pays back the investors and foundaons out of savings achieved by preven ng the need for more costly services in
the future. Another example involves working with local banks to provide College Savings accounts for every child in the County who enrolls in kindergarten
beginning in 2013 and providing seed funding of $100 to encourage college
a ainment.

2014 - 2015 Biennial Opera ng Budget
Cuyahoga County government improves public health and safety, advances our economic and environmental vitality, and promotes
self-suﬃciency through the produc ve investment of public resources.
The mission of Cuyahoga County government includes emphasis on improvements in several key areas, including a con nual search for eﬃciencies, serving as a leader in economic development in the Northeast Ohio region and encouraging regional collabora on that benefits all ci zens of Cuyahoga County.
These objec ves were a driving force in developing the 2014-2015 biennial
opera ng budget. While some priori es stand out among others, the true
mandate for County government under the Charter structure of governance
is to strive to do everything it does much be er, smarter, more eﬃciently and
cost-eﬀec vely. Budget flexibility and proac ve management of resources
has enabled the County to cope with significant revenue reduc ons from the
State. Service levels have been maintained without raising taxes despite a
50% cut to the County’s local government fund alloca on and deep reduc ons
of other State revenue assistance.
Among other objec ves, the 2014-2015 opera ng budget maintains a solid
financial founda on that is essen al to all services and func ons that the
County provides, especially since revenues available for services will only see
modest gains. The Biennial Opera ng Budget, as presented, is balanced in its
programma c and financial components.

Ci zens’ Summary
2014 - 2015 Biennial Opera ng Budget
The 2014-2015 approved biennial General Fund opera ng budget of $377.2
million and $381.5 million (respec vely) over the next biennium includes the
impact of reduc ons in expenditures and staﬃng levels that have occurred
since the adop on of the Charter government in 2011. It is important to
compare the budgeted levels in 2014-2015 with the County’s General Fund
opera ng budget in 2010, the last year under the former structure of governance. The changes implemented in 2011 and the associated savings con nue
through the 2014-2015 approved biennial budget.
The 2014 General Fund opera ng budget of $377.2 million slightly exceeds the
es mated resources and represents a 6.5% increase in comparable ongoing
opera ons since 2012 (See page II-23 for changes in expenditures). The approved opera ng budget for 2015 of $381.5 million funds opera ons at 0.7%
above the assumed resources and represents an increase in ongoing opera ng
expenditures of 0.01% from 2014 to fund the base budgetary needs.

In November, 2013, the voters approved renewals of a 2.9 mill levy and its
increase of 1.0 mill so that the County could con nue to meet growing needs
in the face of declining revenues, especially given the eﬀect of the decreased
valua on in the 2012 reappraisal on property tax revenues and reduced State
revenues. The Execu ve introduced his Execu ve Recommended budget before the voters approved the HHS Levy, and Council used the approved levy to
restore recommended cuts and for other priori es in the final budget.
The Health & Human Services Levy Fund two-year budget of $471.3 million
represents an increase in support of the County’s cri cal Health and Human
Service programs. The $235.3 million in local funding of human services programs in 2014 includes funding for public assistance programs ($88.9 million)
and dollars for health & safety programs of $79.4 million. The 2015 level of
funding of $236.0 million is 12.7 percent higher than in 2013.

Ci zens’ Summary
2014 - 2015 Biennial Opera ng Budget
The 2014-2015 General Fund opera ng budget a empts to balance spending
with exis ng resources. The 2014-2015 budget was passed with slight deficits
that are not material in nature. It has an opera ng deficit of $1.9 million in
2014 and $2.5 million in 2015. General Fund reserve balance is being used to
cover the diﬀerence along with some strategic investments in key areas. The
approved budget includes savings in opera ng budgets and revenue assumpons built on sound assump ons for expected limited growth. The biennial
opera ng plan also preserves the stated objec ve of maintaining a minimum
25% reserve balance to expenditure ra o in the General Fund. The 2014-2015
proposed Health & Human Service Levy Fund budget includes the u liza on of
$9.1 million in Public Assistance fund reserves to maintain the opera ng balance in the HHS Levy Fund. The total expenditures for all County funds are net
of other uses in the General Fund and HHS Levy Fund.
The principal issues facing the County in developing the biennial budget included uncertain economic growth, reduc ons in State assistance, strong demand
for vital County services and a mandate to use resources more eﬃciently and
eﬀec vely. The aforemen oned budget objec ves reflect the primacy of each
of these broad issues of concern when it comes to cra ing the County’s two
year budget plan. The approved budget for 2014-2015 incorporates base levels
of funding for County programs and provides funding for select major ini aves, organiza onal changes, realignments and addi onal levels of funding in
some priority program areas.
Revenue reduc ons, including state budget cuts, con nue to be a major factor in the 2014-2015 Cuyahoga County budget. Like other local governments;
Cuyahoga County’s revenue
streams are sensi ve to economic condi ons. During the
most recent recessionary period the County’s General Fund
revenue base decreased by over
$46.5 million or 12.6% of the
pre-recessionary level. Compared with 2008 revenues, the
2013 General Fund revenues
were 9.5% lower and HHS Levy
was 8.3% a er adjus ng for inII-10

fla on. Over the past year some revenue sources have grown modestly in
comparison to the prior year levels, such as sales tax which grew 4.6%, however total revenue increased 0.6% between 2012 and 2013. The two largest revenue sources, property tax and intergovernmental, declined 0.6% and 18.9%
respec vely in the same period. The revenue es mate in the budget for 20142015 con nues the impacts of State revenue cuts that reduced prior levels of
support to the General Fund and other county funds by over $71.9 million in
the 2012-2013 budget period. As a result of the declining revenue trends and
cuts in State revenue, the County has become more reliant on a few major
sources including sales tax revenue which responds more directly to economic
swings than other sources. In 2008 sales tax collec ons accounted for about
54.5% of General Fund revenue and by 2013 this major source accounted for
over 66% of such revenue. The increased reliance on sales tax par ally results
from a 2% projected increase over 2013 collec ons but primarily results from
decreases in other revenue sources. This decrease in revenue diversifica on is
a relevant concern in rela on to the prospect of long-term growth and sustainability. The biennial budget incorporates these reduced levels of funding and is
designed to provide core programs and make investments despite the decline
in State funding.
The savings realized as a result of opera onal changes since 2010, the last
year before the Charter government took eﬀect, have been carried into the
2014-2015 opera ng budget. A comparison can be made by assuming the
2010 actual level of General Fund expenditures is used as a baseline for the
previous structure of government. In 2010 ongoing General Fund expenditures were at $426.8 million and stand at $377.2 million in the 2014 budget
year. For agency budgets that are now under the direc on of the County Execu ve the levels of ongoing opera ng expenditures have decreased by 39.7%
as compared to that opera onal group in 2010. On an All Funds basis, the
decrease in ongoing opera ng expenses is 13.8% between 2010 and 2014. It
is important to note that the level of savings includes alloca ons for Charter
required en es.
Staﬃng levels have con nued to decline since the Charter government took
eﬀect and were 7.6% lower in 2013 than 2010 on a County-wide basis. Staﬀing levels in agencies that are under the County Execu ve also con nued to
decline and were 10.9% lower in 2013 than in 2010 with a decrease of 279 FTE
over the last biennium. A review of the staﬃng con ngent included in agency
budgets is ongoing.

Ci zens’ Summary
2014 - 2015 Biennial Opera ng Budget
Use of other eﬃciencies to maintain balance include organiza onal restructuring and streamlining opera ons. The change in governance structure has
provided the opportunity to make wide reaching changes to the way resources
are allocated across County programs and eﬃciencies are implemented. Since
Charter adop on, the por on of the County budget and staﬀ under direc on
of the County Execu ve is over 60%. This realignment has enabled restructuring of major func ons of the County that have garnered savings and reduced staﬃng levels. Budgetary savings from organiza onal consolida ons in
fiscal management and public works that were ini ated in 2011 are carried
through the next biennium which allows the County to redirect resources to
new ini a ves. General government saw a 12.8% reduc on in FTE between
2010 and 2013, and social services FTE declined 6.0% in the same period. The
alignment of the County’s fiscal opera on into a unified management structure
alone resulted in savings of approximately $5.5 million. Other reorganiza ons
in Jus ce Services, Public Works, Human Resources, and Informa on Technology have saved dollars and improved the management of these func ons of
County government. The spending plan also incorporates the cost savings
related to suppor ng opera ons. The restructuring of health care plans and
wellness programs to achieve savings and sustainable provision of health care
to employees has helped oﬀset increases
in health care expenses. Countywide appropria on for health care remains flat
in 2014 and increases three percent in
2015. Be er ways to deliver internal services such as building maintenance and
informa on technology support have also
played a role in further reducing the 10%
of the County budget currently devoted to
overhead expenditures. Dollars that are
not spent on this func on could be available for serving ci zens or be used to enhance other priority programs.
The new County Administra on building,
will house many administra ve func ons
beginning in 2014, will reduce the oﬃce
space that the County must maintain. The
new headquarters building is expected to
II-11

achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver cer fica on by the U.S. Green Building Council. LEED cer fied buildings incorporate environmentally sustainable designs that have lower ongoing opera ng
expenses in addi on to the environmental and health benefits and resul ng
produc vity gains. The building’s design includes many energy eﬃcient features such as a roof-top garden. The County had 66 leased or owned properes, and the County oﬀered 13 for sale and will move nearly 750 employees
to the central headquarters including Execu ve Oﬃce, County Council, Fiscal
Oﬃce, Human Resources, Development, Inspector General, Planning Commission, Internal Audit, Informa on Technology, Personnel Review Commission,
Public Works, Public Safety, and Jus ce Services. The headquarters will be on
a prominent block in central downtown, and the building will be adjacent to
an adap ve reuse of the Ameritrust Tower, designed by Marcel Breuer, an architect interna onally renowned for his brutalist style architecture. The block
also includes the historic Ameritrust Rotunda which will house a grocery store.
Maintain adequate reserves in the General Fund and Health & Human Services Levy Fund and achieve structural balance within the biennial budget period. The approved budget balances ongoing General Fund expenditures with
available revenue. The proposed opera ng plan adheres to the exis ng policy

Ci zens’ Summary
for maintaining General Fund reserves at 25% of opera ng expenditures. A er
the reserves on available balance are taken into account, the reserve in the
General Fund exceeds the established threshold by over 30%. Reserve dollars
will be repurposed for making investments related to produc vity and strategic
investments. Reserves in the General Fund include $11 million for the next
year for a 27th payroll, $11.1 million for the Global Center for Health Innovaon, $3.5 million for the Gateway bond guaranty, and $1.0 million for technical improvements. Dollars in excess of the required reserve will be invested in
technology and equipment and may be used to leverage strategic ini a ves
that align with the Western Reserve plan including economic development.
Up to $8 million of the Western Reserve Fund will be used for financing in 2014
including $1.4 million appropriated in the opera ng budget.
There is a planned use of reserve HHS Levy dollars in 2014 and 2015 to fund direct services, early childhood, mental health services and other key programs.
The Public Assistance Fund will be used to decrease the subsidy amounts that
are paid from the HHS Levy Fund to opera ng budgets for human services. In
2014 and 2015 over $10.6 million of this reserve will be directed at reducing
the local share of human service expenditures and oﬀset revenue losses to the
Levy Fund from deceases in State sources and the 8.2% average drop in property values. Using this source of funding will strengthen the posi on of the
Levy Fund and provide addi onal capacity through the two year budget period.
 The approved budget will leverage the exis ng level of resources to make
strategic investments in the community. The 2014-2015 opera ng budget includes alloca ons for new ini a ves which include: Scanning for the
Clerk of Courts and Child Support Enforcement Agency to oﬀer electronic
documents
 Universal Pre-K expansion
 Establishment of the Northeast Ohio Regional Fusion Center to con nue
intelligence sharing and analysis among public and private sectors previously funded through federal grants
 Three a orneys at the Prosecutor’s Oﬃce to work with sex crimes and
crimes against children

 A College Savings program to establish college savings accounts and $100
seed funding for each child entering kindergarten beginning fall 2013
 Temporary increase of 20 FTE in Cuyahoga Job and Family Services during
2014 to manage Medicaid expansion
 Planning for implementa on of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)

 Upgrade to the real property tax system
 Consumer Protec on as a new service of the Fiscal Oﬃce
 Safe Surrender for Juveniles, in partnership with the City of Cleveland and
other community partners, provides a safe place for non-violent fugi ves
to turn themselves in
 The Euclid Jail project, not included in the original 2014 – 2015 budget,
is a budget-neutral pilot to regionalize jail opera ons; the City of Euclid
will repay the County to manage opera ons at the Euclid jail and oversee
improvements to the facility
 Cleveland Jail Project, not included in the original 2014-2015 budget, will
provide needed updates to the jail facility
Resources are devoted to increasing the County’s investment in local economic
development and job crea on. An economic development fund, i.e., the
Western Reserve Fund, has been established within the opera ng budget and

Ci zens’ Summary
will leverage General Fund dollars and County bonding capacity to establish a
fund to support economic development projects. The Capital Improvement
Plan in the 2014 - 2015 approved budget includes a plan to issue debt to
fund three downtown economic development projects. The projects include
Steelyard Commons Shopping Development Phase II to revitalize districts
in Tremont, Ohio City, Old Brooklyn, and the Flats; Conven on Center Hotel
adjacent to the Cleveland Conven on Center; and the Flats East Bank Phase
II for improvements to the east bank of the Cuyahoga River to provide a link

between the River and County residents. Addi onal investments will be made
to create produc vity gains within County opera ons specifically in the areas
of technology and equipment. There is available reserve within the General
Fund to make investments unifying communica ons and data management
throughout the County over the next two to three years. An assessment in
County-wide technology investments as well as poten al return on investment
of proposed upgrades will guide the process.

Budget Parameters
The final product of the biennial budget process is an opera ng plan for
the 2014-2015 period that preserves our priority programs, does not drain
available resources, and provides for the government to operate eﬃciently
and with inherent financial stability. The 2014–2015 budget development
process began at the end of second quarter of 2013 and was completed
on December 10, 2013 with final reading and adop on of the 2014-2015
Biennial Budget and Capital Improvement Plan resolu on (R2013-0229). The

 The salary and fringe benefits were based on 2013 levels projected for
2014 and held flat for non-bargaining employees.

The County passed a two year budget pursuant to the biennial budget ordinance (O2011-0036) and County Charter sec ons 2.03 and 3.09. The ci zens
amended the County Charter November 6, 2012 to require that the County
develop a biennial two year opera ng and capital improvements budgets.
The 2012-2013 budget was the first two year budget adopted by the County.
The adopted budget runs from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015.
There will be a review process to make poten al revisions to the second year
budget in late 2014. The 2016 revenue and expenditures are presented as
es mates in the budget plan schedules, tables and charts.

 Revenue es mates were based on the trends used to project the 20142016 period as of comple on of the 2013 second quarter review. Modifica ons to trends were employed where necessary. (See 2014 – 2015
Revenue Assump ons).

The majority of the 2014-2015 base budget was developed from the results
of the 2013 second quarter budget projec on. The expenditure and revenue
trends established for 2014 were used as a star ng point for the base operating level. The annualized impact of program changes, new budgets and staﬀing changes (including layoﬀs) were included in the 2014–2015 base budget
numbers. A primary benefit of using the 2014 es mate as the star ng point is
the inclusion of approved levels of spending authority across all County programs that is reviewed during the second quarter review process. The es mate in essence serves as a zero based star ng point that can be modified as

II-14

 There was no impact of furlough days in 2014 or 2015. 2011 was the last
year with impact of mandatory furlough days.
 Fringe benefits including health care costs were held flat from 2013 as a
result of lower than expected health care claims. A 3% growth rate is applied to 2015 levels.
 A 2% infla onary parameter was applied to most budgets for opera ng
contracts and other expenditure lines.

 The current budget includes the impact of budget cuts enacted as part of
the State FY2012 – 2013 budget (HB153). In most cases those levels of
reduc on are held flat a er 2014.
 Addi onal requests for funding were evaluated separately from the base
budget development process and within the context of funding source
and budgetary priori es.
 County agencies with self-suppor ng revenues were to limit budgets that
u lized available resources and did not require new or addi onal General
Fund support.

Ci zens’ Summary
2014 - 2015 Budget Assump ons
The revenues that support county opera ons are expected to remain flat overall in 2014-2015 with some growth expected in a few key sources. This outlook
is based on a realis c assessment of local economic condi ons and analysis of
current revenue trends.
At the me of budget submission the economic condi ons were mixed. While
sales tax has exhibited growth, the underlying indicators have been less certain. The unemployment rate in the County was 7.2% in December of 2013
(the latest number available) which remains flat compared to the average rate
a year ago and a drop from the annual average of 8.1% in 2011. The drop in
unemployment is a posi ve sign but the current rate of unemployment and
unemployment claims in the County have not recovered to pre-recessionary
levels. Adding to the uncertainty is the lack of a strong recovery in the housing
market, average sale prices decreased 8.7% between 2009 and 2012, although
they have recovered slightly in the past year. The current delinquency rates on
property taxes are running at 7.5% with total delinquencies over 11.3% the past
year. The rate of price increases has remained low while the median consumer
price index (CPI) rose two percent over the past year. The lower interest rates
that have accompanied decreased prices have greatly reduced the County’s investment earnings resul ng in less opera ng revenue. Since 2008, the County
has seen its investment income decline by more than 85%. The degree of the
economic recovery experienced this year is not as strong as previous periods.
The funds available to finance opera ons are limited to the revenues the County collects each year. The revenue trends drive the resources that are available
in the next budget cycle. Even with some posi ve signs in current trends, General Fund revenue has not yet been restored to pre-recessionary levels, and
a er adjus ng for infla on, has declined 18% between 2008 and 2013. The
revenue es mates will provide the financial founda on for County opera ons.
There are several perspec ves that were considered as part of that process:

II-16

 What is the new normal for growth? Annual growth rates of 3% were
considered standard in previous years. The new expecta on for growth
in sales tax and charges is assumed to be only slightly ahead of infla on
in the next three years.
 How does inflaƟon limit real revenue growth? Infla on is currently tracking at around 2.2% percent (using median CPI measure) and is below the
level associated with strong economic growth. Sustained low levels of
infla on will translate into flat tax collec ons and degrade the real level
of growth over me.
 The trend is more important than the number. Iden fying es mates for
key revenue sources is an important part of developing the 2014-2015
budget. The trends associated with these sources are also a very cri cal
part of plo ng out the next three years of the County opera ng plan.
 Where are the best prospects for revenue growth? Improvements to the
local economy and job crea on will have a pronounced eﬀect on sales tax
collec ons which is expected to remain grow approximately 2% annually.
The next two years will be a pivotal me in the County. The undertaking
of large local projects could act to mul ply economically sensi ve revenue streams including sales tax.
 How does the State’s level revenue growth impact the County? Cuyahoga
County receives millions of dollars of assistance from the State budget
that impact the es mates for the opera ng budget. Lower levels of revenue as a result of the State budget cuts have driven this source of funding
down. Reduc ons in the State’s local-government fund and the eliminaon of the tangible personal property tax have contributed to the loss in
revenue. For example, the County’s local-government fund alloca on is
expected to be 16.9 million in 2014 which is half of what it was in 2011.

Ci zens’ Summary
2014 - 2015 Budget Assump ons
The revenue es mate for General Fund and HHS Levy Fund combined is
$605.8 million in 2014 and $609.1 million in 2015. All Funds revenue for 2014
is $1,293.6 million, a modest increase from 2013 actual and just short of 2012
actual. A large por on of the decline is a ributable to the decrease in federal
and state revenue. The con nua on of tepid economic growth is expected to
keep most revenue sources flat.

Combined General Fund revenue is expected to increase by $5.7 million in
2015, or less than 1% from 2014.
The two main forces aﬀec ng most County revenues are economic factors
and levels of governmental support. The economically sensi ve sources are directly pushed up or down over me based on condi ons in the local economy.
The steep decline in sales tax in 2009 (10.9% decrease) and decline of real estate charges are demonstra ve of how the recent recession has le its mark on
County revenue streams. Sales tax revenues have begun to rebound but have
not reached pre-recessionary levels. Economic condi ons also place pressure
on State funding streams including Local Government Fund dollars and public
assistance alloca ons. These factors combined with Federal and State budgetary policy decisions impact the flow of dollars to Cuyahoga County.
Revenue loss in intergovernmental sources has placed a strain on the HHS
Levy Fund as the decrease in intergovernmental revenue has required an increase in local match to maintain the same level of support for public assistance programs. Lower levels of State support will require the County to use
addi onal HHS Levy dollars or other sources of funding for public assistance
programs.
As the reliability of intergovernmental sources has declined, the ability of the
HHS Levy to supplement public assistance program funding has weakened.
The combina on of State budget cuts and declines in property tax values lowered revenue es mates for the Levy Fund by $2.0 million over the 2014-2015
biennium before the voters approved a renewal and increase in the levies, and
with voter approval will now increase $25.2 million over 2013. The full property 2012 reappraisal resulted in a decrease in the health and human services
levies of $15.0 million in 2013. This decrease has resulted in a drop in property
tax revenue of approximately $10.1 million in 2013.

 Investment Earnings - es mated at $3.6 million in 2014 based on the reinvestment of a substan al por on of the por olio at 0.75%-1.0% rates
over the next two years. Short-term rates are expected to remain persistently low and will result in meager returns for at least two more years.
The budget assumes short-term rates will pick up a er 2015 and interest
earnings will increase in subsequent years.
 Charges for Services & Fines - General Fund charges for services are expected to increase by $7.0 million (12.3%) in 2014 and remain flat in the
following years. The budget es mate assumes charges and fees related
to real estate transac ons will track at an average increase of 5% as the
local housing market will begin to show signs of improvement over the
next three years. The other major change is due to the shi of Informa on Technology and other administra ve charges to the indirect cost

 Other Sources –The collec ons of the 1% bed tax are an cipated to grow
by 6.5% in 2014 and 2015. Casino Tax revenue is reflected in a separate
fund and was budgeted at $8.2 million per year but recent projec ons
indicate collec ons may come short of this.

 Real Revenue Levels – The impact of infla on on real revenue levels reveals a more pronounced drop in the overall trend since the pre-recessionary peak in 2007. The purchasing power of opera ng dollars has declined by over 12% between 2007 and 2013 when the impact of infla on
as measured by CPI is taken into account.

State FY2014 - 2015 Budget Impacts (HB59)
Both years of the biennial budget include impacts of the enacted State budget
(H.B. 59). The FY2014-2015 State Budget went into eﬀect July 1st of calendar
year 2013 and will con nue through June 30th 2015. The last biennium saw
decreases to the General Fund resul ng from changes at the State of Ohio for
the Local Government Fund reduc on and accelerated phase out of the reimbursement revenue.
The revenue loss numbers have a direct impact on the funding of general opera ons of the County and have hit especially hard in the health and human
service budgets. The State budget cuts manifest as decreases in revenue to the
County from a variety of State sources including Local Government Fund, CAT
reimbursement, Public U lity reimbursement and State revenue assistance to
County JFS programs. A summary of the revenue losses to the County on a
calendar year basis are provided in the above table. The Local Government
Fund Revenue will decrease to $16.9 million in 2014, a drop that is in line with
the current State budget.

Other Impacts
The proposed revenue budget includes the impact from casino revenues based
on ac vity as of the budget development. This became a new source of revenue in 2012, and ac vity will be monitored and projec ons updated during
2014 – 2015.

2014Ͳ2015OperatingBudgetͲAllFundsExpenditures

What we do: Help our ci zens become economically self suﬃcient, protect
the health and safety of our children, frail elderly and vulnerable populaons.
While revenues have declined, the needs of our ci zens in the area of Health
and Human Services have not. Economic changes have made it more diﬃcult
for individuals and families to earn a living wage. The number of individuals in
the County living in poverty grew from 13.1% in 2000 to 18.2% in 2010 according to census data. For Cuyahoga County families, 13.6% have incomes below
the poverty level according to 2012 census es mates versus 10.9% na onally.
For Cuyahoga County families with children, 22.1% have incomes below poverty compared with 18.2% na onally.
The Health and Human Services func on is the County’s largest func onal area
and represents 44.4% of the total All Funds opera ng budget (Social Services and por ons of Health & Safety combined). This func on is budgeted at
$582.4 million in 2014 and 576.0 in 2015. The 2014 budget is $36.6 million or
6.7 % higher than 2013 expenditures. The increase in the Human Services budget has an impact on the Human Services Levy expenditures by increasing the
amount of levy dollars required to subsidize the related programs. The agencies that are part of the County HHS system have to carefully priori ze services
and work to lessen the impact of State budget reduc ons by focusing on cri cal and mandated objec ves. The addi onal levels of funding for staﬃng and
services above the base level of funding in the 2014-2015 budget totals $10.5
million, and uses the renewal and replacement levy dollars that the voters approved a er the Execu ve introduced his budget and before Council approved
the final budget.
Two changes in statewide policy have aﬀected the human services budgets.
The County had to increase staﬃng so to verify the eligibility of SNAP (food
stamp) par cipants and adjust benefits accordingly given that the State of Ohio
opted not to request a statewide waiver to more stringent work requirements
for Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents. Addi onally, the Medicaid expansion in Ohio drove the need to hire approximately 20 addi onal staﬀ to
process eligibility.

Ci zens’ Summary
2014 - 2015 Expenditure Budget by Func on
Health & Safety
The County funds ins tu ons that promote the health and safety of its ci zens.
Comprised of health maintenance ($40.1 million), mental health and alcohol
and drug abuse ($39.4), emergency assistance ($8.4 million) and animal control ($1.9 million). The Health & Safety func on ($89.8 million) makes up 6.9%
of the total All Funds opera ng budget. Most of these funds ($70.4 million
each in 2014 and 2015) are budgeted in the Health & Human Services Levy
Fund. The County provides ongoing support to two major ins tu ons from
Levy dollars. The MetroHealth Hospital System provides quality medical and
long-term care for all ci zens, regardless of their ability to pay. The Alcohol,
Drug Addic on and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) Board provides a network of preven on and treatment services to combat alcoholism and drug
abuse among youth and adults and counseling and mental health services. The
level of funding for MetroHealth was increased by $4.0 million in the budget
and the ADMHS Board was provided addi onal Levy support of $5.0 million
a er the Levy was approved in November, 2013, which is an increase of $4.5
million over 2013 expenditures.

Jus ce and Public Safety
What we do: Administer jus ce fairly through the County’s Court system and
ensure the safety of ci zens through the enforcement of laws and the maintenance of correc onal facili es for both juvenile and adult oﬀenders.
A major func on of county government is the opera on of the legal and judicial systems. These systems include agencies that prosecute oﬀenders, collect
evidence, establish and enforce orders for the collec on of child and spousal
support, counsel vic ms of crime, and provide legal counsel to indigent defendants. The County also operates an adult correc onal facility and a juvenile deten on center, which provide counseling, psychiatric, medical, and substance
abuse services to oﬀenders.
The Jus ce & Public Safety All Funds budget $306.9 million for 2014 is $20.3
million or 7.1% higher than 2013 expenditures. The 2015 budget provides
$310.9 million. Public Safety and Jus ce system expenditure are significant to
the County budget overall (23.7%) and comprise a majority of General Fund
opera ng expenditures at over 64% of general opera ons. The significant areas of Public Safety and Jus ce are the budgets for the Courts ($93.1 million)
and the County Sheriﬀ ($82.4 million), totaling more than $175.5 million or
II-25

73.7% of the General Fund opera ng budget for Public Safety and Jus ce. In
addi on to General Fund dollars, the Jus ce area is financed with $19.7 million of Health and Human Services Levy funds that are channeled to juvenile
oﬀender programs and human service related purposes in the jus ce system
including Juvenile Court Children Services, Juvenile Court Youth & Family Community Partnership, Family Jus ce Center, Re-entry, and Criminal Jus ce Interven on. The total combined General Fund Jus ce budget (including HHS
Levy subsidies) of $266.2 million in 2014 is flat compared with the 2012-2013
budget. Increases in the 2014 Jus ce System base budgets were included for
Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Court, and Domes c Rela ons Courts. The
2014 and 2015 budget for the Sheriﬀ may be amended to include funding for
the Euclid jail project to operate the Euclid Jail and make improvements to the
facility. The City of Euclid will pay the County for the costs of the services, and
the project will have no impact on the General Fund.

General Government and Administra on
What we do: Manage the work of county government eﬃciently to ensure
quality services and protect the fiscal integrity of Cuyahoga County.
General government captures the general opera ng cost of county government and includes the budgets of the Administra on, Fiscal Oﬃce, Informaon Technology, Public Works and Board of Elec ons. All Funds and General
Fund general govern¬ment expenditures are budgeted at $153.9 million and
$65.2 million, respec vely. General government opera ng expenditures (net
of other uses) are $5.9 million higher in 2014 The budgeted expenditures for
internal services total $50.8 million and include building maintenance, custodial, security, supplies, copies, postage, and IT. Approximately 75% of these
expenditures impact the General Fund and HHS levy accounts.
One factor that increased 2013 expenses in general government results from
the consolida on of the Informa on Technology (IT) budget pursuant to
County Ord. No. O2012-0012. The budgets for IT staﬀ and contracts had been
disbursed among mul ple agencies and were transferred to the consolidated
Department of Informa on Technology budget during 2013. Those expenses
are now charged to the non-General Fund user agencies as part of the cost
alloca on plan rather than having those expenses directly in agency budgets.
Approximately $1.6 million in contracts was moved to the Department of IT
from outside general government during 2013, and this amount is expected

Ci zens’ Summary
2014 - 2015 Expenditure Budget by Func on
to increase because 2014 will be the first year full of the consolidated IT budget. The 2014 IT budget also includes staﬀ consolida on. The 2014 budget
increased FTE from 98 to 141 (44%), and a salary/benefits increase approximately $4.4 million (58%) compared with 2012.

Economic Development
What we do: Invest in a strong countywide economy.
The opera ng budget includes $5.7 million in 2014 and $6.2 million in 2015 for
General Fund Development spending. Including support of debt service payments in support of development projects, the General Fund opera ng budget
is 40.8 million in 2014 and $41.4 million in 2015 or 10.8% the total General
Fund opera ng expenditures. Spending in this func onal area provides funding for a number of economic development programs geared at sustaining or
improving the economic vitality of the County and encouraging small business
development.
Addi onal County resources are being u lized through the Western Reserve
Fund which will be capitalized with financing proceeds beginning in 2014.
General Fund reserves ($6.6 million) will be u lized in 2014 to capitalize the
Western Reserve Fund. The biennial budget includes General Fund support of

II-26

debt service ($1.4 million) related to $15 million in Western Reserve projecting financing. The revenue for the Casino Tax Fund is included in the revenue
es mate but no budget es mate has been included for program expenditures
in the biennial budget. It is expected that the resources available in the fund
will be appropriated throughout the next biennium for uses permi ed by the
enabling ordinance.

Public Works
What we do: Maintain County infrastructure and assure availabilty of these
assets for residents to u lize.
The opera ng budget includes $66.2 million and $67.1 million in 2014 and
2015 for spending on public works. The vast majority of these dollars (97.8%)
are devoted to the County’s administra on of road and bridge and sanitary
sewer infrastructure by the Department of Public Works. These opera ng
budgets for this agency represent both the administra ve and local share of
maintenance and improvements of local infrastructure. The remainder of the
public works programma c budget for 2014-2015 is devoted to maintaining
County assets including the Airport ($1.5 million) and Parking Garages ($3.1
million). The funding for the public works budget is primarily derived from
special revenue sources and charges for services.

Contractual and Client Services
The next major expenditure category is contractual and client services. In 2014
the budget provides $466.1 million or 36.0% of allocated resources to fund
contracts and agreements for a variety of goods and services.
In 2014, the $131.4 million component of this grouping funds the various service provider contracts for health and human service programs and payments
made directly to or on behalf of clients. Medical payments, foster care, substance abuse treatment, subsidized adop ons are examples of these types of
expenditures. The amounts budgeted for 2015 will remain rela vely stable
with some fluctua on related to cyclical changes.

Other Expenditures
Commodi es ($25.0 million) represent items such as gas, electricity, water,
oﬃce supplies and other miscellaneous supplies. Controlled expenses ($58.3
million) are payments from agencies for shared services that include the maintenance of County space, Security, Informa on Technology Services and Administra ve Services. This has decreased from the 2012-2013 budget because
Informa on Technology expenses are no longer charged back to General Fund
agencies under the consolidated IT structure. Other Expenditures ($130.3 million) are purchases such as postage, vehicle maintenance and copying and other costs related to ongoing opera ons. Capital Outlays ($20.7 million) refers
to the purchase of equipment, furniture or other fixed assets and the County’s
share of road, bridge and sewer construc on contracts that are housed in the

Changes in Expenditure Trends 2010 - 2014
Cuyahoga County has undergone an historic change in governance structure since 2010 that has resulted in significant changes to the overall opera ng budget. Changes in organiza onal structure and programma c funding
levels have had an impact on County spending over the last two biennia. A
useful comparison of overall expenditure trends and varia on since County
reorganiza on became eﬀec ve is the diﬀerence between 2010 expenditure levels and the budgeted level for 2014. The All Funds opera ng expenditures decreased from $1,411.8 million in 2010 to $1,287.1 million in
2013 (9.3%). The 2014 All Funds opera ng appropria on of $1,305.6 million

shows a slight increase (1.9%) over 2013 expenditures. The current budget
includes services added since 2010 that improve eﬃciencies including Inspector General, Internal Audit, expansion of employee Wellness programs, and
Personnel Review Commission as well as services to residents with examples
including Consumer Protec on, College Savings Program, veterans services,
and economic development programs.

ary adjustments followed the recommenda ons of classifica on study of all
posi ons formerly under the independent Auditor, Recorder, and Treasurer,
and Clerk of Court Title Bureau employees. The 2014-2015 budget maintains
the reduced personal services budgets.

The actual full me equivalent (FTE) for agencies under the County Execu ve
have decreased by 555 posi ons from 2010 to 2013 to a total of 4,536 FTEs.
The level of staﬃng reduc ons have been achieved by layoﬀ, a ri on, resignaons, and re rements. The FTE level of 4,536 represents a 7.6% decrease in
employees in Execu ve agencies, although the 2014 budget includes appropria on for vacancies and totals 4,893 FTE.

Employees of Execu ve agencies received a 1% salary increase in 2013 and
one- me performance bonuses of up to $1,500. The 2014-2015 budget does
not include addi onal increases or performance bonuses for Execu ve agencies. The 2014-2015 budget includes the impacts of salary increases provided
to non-Execu ve agencies that occurred before budget development and further salary increases only to employees of bargaining units pursuant to agreements with the County. The 2014 budget includes appropria on to perform a
classifica on study which could poten ally result in future impacts on personnel budgets of Execu ve agencies.

The salary expenditure levels budgeted within the Execu ve agencies maintain
these lower funded levels for salary expenses through the 2014-2015 biennium. The 2012-2013 budget included a $2 million budget reduc on to Fiscal Office personal services which the Department met through staﬀ reduc ons and
salary adjustments. The Fiscal Oﬃce salaries were adjusted in 2012 to bring
employees within the salary range of their newly classified posi ons. The salPersonnelCosts&StaffingLevels(FTEs)2006Ͳ2016

2014Ͳ2015OperatingBudget

The total salary budget in 2014 is $526.0 million and $258.3 million in 2015.
The salary budget was established using the 2013 second quarter payroll projec on for 2014 (budget year) and included funding for staﬃng at the
current approved levels. There are no impacts in the 2014 or 2015 staﬃng
budget for furloughs. The last mandatory furlough occurred in 2011. The 2014
personnel budget increases 5.0% over 2013 actual expenses.
The 2014-2015 budget provides addi onal allotment for up to 42 direct service
staﬀ in human services to verify eligibility for expansion of Medicaid services
and redetermina ons in food stamps because of the more stringent work requirements for Able-bodied Adults Without Dependents. The budget includes
addi onal staﬃng in the Fiscal Oﬃce for the added scanning services and
Consumer Protec on now oﬀered. The Fiscal Oﬃce, HHS Senior and Adult
Services, and Cuyahoga Support Enforcement Agency had lower 2013 payroll
expenditures due to vacancies.

Ci zens’ Summary
County Staﬃng Levels
County-wide Staﬃng Levels (FTEs)
The County uses the budgetary measure of full me equivalents to allocate
resources for and monitor the costs of human capital. It should be noted at
the beginning of this sec on that while the budget is based on the number of
full- me equivalents or FTEs (Schedule II) some employees are part- me workers, and some full- me posi ons are vacant for a period of me each year, the
actual number of staﬀ (head-count) will usually be higher than the number
of FTEs which is calculated by using actual hours worked. The vast majority of
County staﬀ are employed in agencies that administer health and human service programs (39.7%) or Jus ce programs (40.5%). The County will con nue
to commit much of its funding towards the human capital required to maintain
these strategically important func ons of County government.

II-33

Since over 40% ($526.0 million in 2014) of the total budget is ed to the costs
of personnel, it is one of the main areas of discre on to adjust budget levels
when necessary. The County has had to adjust staﬃng levels by way of rerement, layoﬀ and a ri on over the last five years to accommodate lower
levels of revenue and State support. The 2014-2015 budget provides funding
for 7,891 FTEs in 2014 and 7,894 in 2014. In most cases the vacant posi ons
are in actuality a reinstatement of posi ons that were eliminated the previous
year. Schedule VIII provides the staﬃng level by organiza on. The 2014-2015
budget includes increased staﬃng levels in Fiscal Oﬃce and Human Services.

Ci zens’ Summary
Five Year Forecast
Five Year Forecast
The County’s biennial opera ng budget provides for a structurally balanced
funding of opera ons from ongoing General Fund resources. It is important to
review the trajectory of the County’s fiscal sustainability through the use of a
five year forecast. An analysis of the five year outlook of the General Fund and
General Debt Service Fund combined is presented in the following summary
table. Both funds have a strong linkage because:
1. Revenue from property taxes derived from the 1.45 inside millage are split
between these funds.
2. Long-term General Fund dollars are used to support debt service on bonds
secured with the general obliga on pledge of the County.
3. The combined opera ng surplus or deficit of this pool of funding provides
a benchmark for the ability to support addi onal long-term financing for
projects and other investments using reserves.

Revenue
 Property tax revenue decreases by 5% star ng in 2013. The loss is borne
by the General Fund
 Collec ons begin to rebound by 5% in 2015
 Collec ons on the voted Jail bonds ($6.7 million annually) term out in
2013
 2% annual growth for sales tax in 2015-2016
 5% growth in conveyance fee revenue in 2015-2016
 5% growth in local government fund alloca on star ng in 2014 a er the
freeze in funding phases out
 3% decrease in fines collected for court costs
 5% increase in investment earnings as short-term rates increase 50-100
basis points
 3% decrease miscellaneous revenue and reimbursements

The five year forecast was built based on the proposed revenue and expenditure levels for the 2012-2014 budget cycle. The revenue and expenditure
trends for the out years of the forecast (2015-2016) were based on the following assump ons:

II-37

 All other sources are held flat through 2016

Ci zens’ Summary
Five Year Forecast
Expenditures
 Salary expenditures assume flat levels of employment
 Fringe benefit expenses increase by 5% in 2015-2016 to cover increased
health care costs
 2% infla onary increase for other expenses

The resul ng capacity for addi onal long-term financing or investments in other uses is $6.4 million in 2014 and 4.5 million in 2015. The combined opera ng
surplus increases to over $5.1 million in 2016. The last two years of the forecast are subject to change based on updated assump ons and changing levels
in State support.

 Contractual and overhead costs are held flat in 2015-2016
 Debt service is based on exis ng bond payments and adds the annual impact of bonds issued in 2012 and 2015 to fund ongoing capital

Ci zens’ Summary
Interfacing Financial Policies
The County’s financial condi on can be directly a ributed to the commitment
to establish, implement and maintain conserva ve financial and budgetary
policies. For the lis ng of these specific policies see the Budget Guide secon. In addi on, the funding decisions for the various County divisions in the
Program Budget Sec on were derived with these policies in mind. These policies are the basis by which financial decisions are weighed and determined.
The addi onal resources that were commi ed to programs in the approved
2014-2015 budget were subjected to an evalua on based on these factors.
The County’s five year forecast and modeling capability is another valuable tool
in determining the impact of financial decisions in the future years.
The stated policies stress the close rela onship between the planning and
budgetary process to maximize eﬃcient use of public dollars. The policies are
reviewed annually by Fiscal Oﬃce at the start of each budget cycle and communicated to administrators, agencies and members of Council as the budget
process commences.
1. An emphasis on strong financial management and leveraging of a consolidated Fiscal Oﬃce to perform the planning, budge ng and implementa on
of the required financial du es of the County. There is an emphasis on
the primacy of strong planning and financial flexibility in determining how
resources will be allocated amongst complex and varying circumstances.
2. Limi ng the use of reserves as a stabiliza on fund and/or for one- me expenditures such as economic development, pilot projects and equipment
upgrades. Replenishment of reserves that exceed the established target
will occur in a manner that complies with any staﬃng policies.
3. All requests for funding are reviewed by the Fiscal Oﬃce and formal recommenda ons are completed. Referring requests for funding of services
for which there is an established outside oﬃcial (board), in order to integrate those requests into the planning and funding focus, and facilitate a
community-wide coordinated system and a reliance on strong proac ve
financial management.
4. As the County targets the reserve balance, establishing a quan fiable range
of debt levels more stringent than established by the applicable requirements and guidelines to preserve the County’s strong financial posi on. To
provide for temporary financing of unforeseen emergency needs, and to
II-39

permit orderly adjustment to changes resul ng from reduc ons of revenue
sources through ac ons of other governmental bodies or influences, the
County’s policy is to maintain at least 25% of an cipated annual expenditures as a reserve level.
Through sound financial management, Cuyahoga County has achieved an
AA3 bond ra ng for conduit bonds and AA for general obliga on bonds from
Moody’s Investors Service and an AA3 bond ra ng for conduit bonds and AA1
for general obliga on bond from Standard & Poor’s Ra ngs Services. These
ra ngs give Cuyahoga County a high level of marketability and result in the
County being able to borrow for needed capital improvements at low interest
rates, thus realizing savings for the ci zens of the County. The County will connue to develop budget plans that preserve the stated level of reserves in the
General Fund while making these investments.
The reasons to maintain a healthy cash reserve are:
 Most General Fund opera ng revenues are ed to resources that are sensi ve to economic swings.
 Unexpected catastrophes or situa ons (lawsuits, disasters, etc.)
 Cash flow needs since the state reimburses expenses and advances are
not received in a mely manner.
 Achievement of the lowest possible interest rates on long-term debt financing of County projects.
 State and federal budgets, which the County has minimal influence over,
govern the amount the County receives each year in intergovernmental
revenue which is the County’s largest revenue source.
The County’s planning process will con nue to synchronize the various County
en es’ service ini a ves with the opera ng budget and the capital improvement program. The Budget Plan and the quarterly review of the various enes’ status con nue to show fiscal restraint by limi ng the growth of new
programs and encouraging opera ng eﬃciencies. These measures reflect the
County’s commitment to live within its means, both now and in the future.

Performance Management
CountyStat

Introduc on
Introduc on
The objec ve of Performance Management is to:
 Ar culate and communicate the mission and priority goals of county
government with an emphasis on expected outcomes/results-oriented
performance.
 Reinforce ci zens’ confidence in and strengthen accountability of county
government by providing a public record of service accomplishments.
 Create appropriate processes and systems that will allow and encourage
the best work of county employees.
 Provide departments with the necessary basic training to develop benchmark/control standards for appropriate monitoring and analysis of their
internal opera ons for con nuous improvement.
 Strengthen linkages between departments’ program budgets and their
funding streams and assist with decision-making.
 Compile rou nely and present performance outcomes based on measurable goals and objec ves that are consistent with the County’s overall
mission, to internal customers and most importantly, to external stakeholders, the ci zens of Cuyahoga County.

II-40

Cuyahoga CountyStat is a well-organized, data-driven accountability system
that is used as a decision-making and communica ons strategy. The county
measures performance in order to start a conversa on about why. Asking difficult ques ons helps us achieve our purpose: to gather and report on accurate and mely data; guide the alloca on of resources; develop eﬀec ve goals
and objec ves; allow for the con nual monitoring of progress on measures;
and demonstrate accountability and transparency. This program is currently
u lized for all County agencies that are under the jurisdic on of the County
Execu ve. The reorganiza on of County departments under the Charter form
of government structure has increased the scope of the administra on as compared to the former commissioner system. Agency staﬀ and programs within
the purview of the Execu ve now comprise 63% of the County’s opera ng budget. The ongoing review cycle is now used as a driving force for assessing and
repor ng on the performance and outcomes of Execu ve agency programs.
County agencies that are not under the Execu ve submit performance plans
in conjunc on with development of the annual opera ng budget. These plans
include the stated mission of each agency and the core objec ves related to
achieving the mission. Indicators used to measure success of outcomes related
to each program are compiled and monitored during the current year. These
performance plans share similar tenants as CountyStat but are technically separate from the actual CountyStat program. See Departmental Performance
sec on.

Ci zens’ Summary
The 2014 - 2015 Budget Plan Document
The 2014-2015 budget plan document presents the policies, priori es and program budgets at both summary and detail levels. The informa on contained
within the budget document present the viewer a complete and accurate picture of the approved budget and an cipated resources of the County and complies with budget repor ng requirements set forth in the County Charter.

Biennial Budget Format
This document is the second budget plan published subsequent to the County
adop ng a biennial budget process. The majority of the narra ve and charts
have retained the look and feel of previous edi ons with some excep ons. The
narra ve in the sec ons that cover the opera ng budget; Ci zens’ Summary,
Revenue Analysis and Fund Summary reference both budget years in many of

II-41

the passages. The 2014 and 2015 budgets are similar but describing both budget years is one way to convey the nature of our opera ng budget.
The format for charts in the main aforemen oned sec ons has remained intact. Two methods were employed to further emphasize the two year format
of the opera ng budget. In charts where data is presented in columnar fashion
below the graphic both 2014 and 2015 data use bold forma ng. Secondly, the
percentages used in pie charts to convey propor onality of components use
the average of the biennial budget years.

Budget Guide
Organiza on of the Budget Plan
The budget process consists of ac vi es that encompass the development,
implementa on, and evalua on of Cuyahoga County’s plan for the provision
of services, as well as the acquisi on and maintenance of capital assets. The
goal of the budget process is to help County leadership make informed choices
about these services and assets and to promote stakeholder par cipa on in
the process.
The purpose of this sec on is to explain the format and content of the 20142015 Biennial Budget Plan and to provide guidance to those who wish to
analyze the Budget Plan in greater detail. In a document as large and complex
as this, it can be diﬃcult for the reader to locate topics of interest; this sec on
seeks to aid in that task.
A great deal of a en on has been given to make the 2014-2015 Budget Plans
a user-friendly document. A comprehensive Table of Contents is included
at the beginning of this volume. Each major chapter starts with a lis ng of
subjects covered in that area. Charts, with accompanying narra ves, are used
extensively to be er illustrate the data. Throughout the document, analysts
have provided comments to direct the reader toward associated topics. The
Budget Plan concludes with an Index of subjects and agencies.
The main sec ons of the 2012-2013 Budget Plan are the following:
 The Ci zens’ Summary is a synopsis of the 2014-2015 Budget Plan for
those who desire only an overview of County opera ons, programs and
finances. It provides an execu ve summary of the budget, a general profile of the community, summaries of revenues and expenditures, a staﬀing analysis, and other informa ve material. As the reader progresses
through the Plan, the data highlighted in the Ci zens’ Summary is presented in much more detail.
 The Budget Guide sec on provides a road map of Cuyahoga County government. It outlines the Adopted Budget Plan and introduces the reader
to the County budget process. A chart of the Schedule of Budget Events
depicts the process and event melines. Organiza onal charts of the financial and repor ng rela onships are presented and described.
III-1

 The Revenue Analysis sec on details each of the County’s major revenue sources, providing an in-depth look at the process and ra onale
of projec ng revenues. The County’s major discre onary budget fund,
the General Fund, is presented separately in the Revenue Analysis and
in subsequent chapters. The reader should review the Revenue Analysis
to learn exactly from where and how the County receives the money to
support its many services and opera ons.
 The Fund Budgets sec on details the County fund structure emphasizing
the historical, current, and prospec ve status of the various fund types.
This presenta on does not emphasize County departments or programs.
The importance of fund balances, or reserves, and bond ra ngs are discussed. Subsidies to other funds, a major expenditure category in the
General Fund, are presented. Data on categorical grants are presented
here. The principal reason for the fund budget format is to examine the
basic structure of funds, the interac on of fund types, and the trend in
unencumbered fund balances over me. The current and future financial
viability of the County as a financial en ty is examined in this chapter.
 The Departmental Performance sec on includes an introductory discussion on the County Stat performance management ini a ve and the
County Execu ve's agencies' CountyStat goals, objec ves, and measures
as of February 2014. For the departments that do not par cipate in the
CountyStat program, i.e., the county courts, boards, and commissions,
the departmental performance plans are included in this sec on.
 The most detailed informa on in the 2014-2015 Adopted Budget Plan is
contained in the Program Budgets sec on. To aid the reader in loca ng
topics of interest, a Table of Contents has been included on each secon’s (e.g. General Government, Judicial) tab and an Index is found at
the end of the Plan. Informa on is presented by func on (e.g. General
Government, Judicial, Social Services), program (e.g. Administra on, Adjudica on, Oﬀender Management) and by Department (e.g. County Treasurer, County Prosecutor, Department of Children and Family Services.)
Historical, budgeted, and projected expenses and program sta s cs are
provided for each division. Those interested in the total budgets and

Budget Guide
Organiza on of the Budget Plan
over-arching goals of par cular agencies will find that informa on in the
Departmental Performance sec on, whereas the Program Budgets secon provides more detailed informa on on the lowest level possible.
 The Capital Improvements Plan presents the County’s policies and processes for maintaining and expanding its physical assets. Capital projects
approved for 2014-2015 are described and their funding source specified. Future year projects are also presented. The impact on opera ng
budgets of planned capital projects is discussed.

III-2

 The final sec on, Debt Management, describes the types of debt the
County can incur and the limita ons on debt level. Procedures, policies,
and plans for debt re rement are presented, including a debt re rement
schedule and a lis ng by issue of all debt outstanding as of January 1,
2014.
 An Index and Glossary are located at the end of the document. The Glossary provides readers with a defini on of key terms used throughout the
document. The Index is provided to locate informa on by topic.

Budget Guide
Introduc on
The ar cula on of policies governing the County’s budget process is a diﬃcult,
yet meaningful, task. When an agency seeks the financial support of the County
Execu ve and authorized by the County Council, it is best for all concerned that
the framework for making decisions be clearly understood.
At the County level of government, funding priori es are o en determined by
the State of Ohio through the Ohio Revised Code and en tlement programs, and
by the Federal government through en tlements and categorical grants. The
County is directed by a large body of laws, program mandates, rules, strictures,
and fund matching requirements and is always a en ve to limita ons on its
opera ons.

III-3

The reader should note that on November 3, 2009, Cuyahoga County ci zens
voted to create a charter government to begin January 1, 2011. The new
form of government includes an elected County Execu ve and an 11-member
council. Please see the County Charter for more informa on. The County’s
commitment to eﬀec vely and eﬃciently manage its opera ons in conformity
with legal direc ves remains firm. The Financial, Investment, Debt, and Capital
Improvement Financial Policies are an aid in accomplishing this end.

Budget Guide
Cuyahoga County Charter
Introduc on
Cuyahoga County adopted a charter form of government in 2011, which was
overwhelmingly approved by Cuyahoga County voters in 2009. The Charter
of Cuyahoga County (“Charter”) replaced the three-member Board of County
Commissioners, which served both legisla ve and execu ve func ons,
with an Execu ve and an 11 member legisla ve Council. The Charter also
consolidated several separately elected oﬃces under the direc on of the
Execu ve and added func ons to improve ethics, equality, and support
economic development.
Following approval of the Charter, Cuyahoga County government and
community members spent one year on transi on planning, and the voters
elected Edward FitzGerald as their first County Execu ve. The new government
structure took eﬀect under the direc on of the County Execu ve and Council
on January 1, 2011.

History
Prior to the Charter, Cuyahoga County had a statutory form of government,
where a three commissioner board performed both legisla ve and execu ve
func ons. Coun es that do not take the preroga ve to adopt an alterna ve
form of government operate under a default form of government under
statutory requirements. The Ohio Cons tu on allows coun es to adopt a
charter form of government which allows home rule authority to do anything
not prohibited by law. Cuyahoga County is the second county to u lize this
op on a er Summit County, which has had a Charter since 1981. County
reform did not come about quickly. For almost a century, Cuyahoga County
saw at least one major reform ini a ve per decade before it finally approved
the Charter in 2009.
Circumstances at the me of the Charter vote contributed to its success
including corrup on allega ons and an economic recession. Adop on of
county reform was overwhelmingly approved following mul ple major
inves ga ons of corrup on within county government. Reform likely gained
III-4

more support in light of these allega ons because the Charter includes
measures to increase accountability and oversight including provisions that
specifically address ethics and equity. The Charter also decreased the number
of elected posi ons and replaced them with appointments. The 2009 vote also
occurred at the height of a recession following a year of significant economic
declines. The recession highlighted the need for government eﬃciency. The
Charter streamlines many func ons of government by consolida ng oﬃces
and puts a priority on economic development.

Transi on
Cuyahoga County underwent a transi on prepara on process following
approval of county reform. The Charter required the County Commissioners
to create a Transi on Advisory Group to oversee planning. The transi on
planning included community input through recommenda ons provided by
volunteer workgroups. Almost 1300 volunteers from the public signed up to
par cipate. These recommenda ons were incorporated along with na onal
best prac ces into a report submi ed to Execu ve-elect Edward FitzGerald to
provide guidance through the transi on. Most of the recommenda ons were
implemented during the first year under the new government.

Purposes
The Charter’s preamble states the purposes for government reform including
economic growth and job crea on, eﬀec ve and accountable leadership,
collabora on and regionalism, equity, and streamlined government. To this
end, the Charter requires an annual five year economic development plan for
the County itself and other agencies and organiza ons. It also consolidates
func ons and departments to streamline government and increase
accountability.
A charter form of government gives ci zens, through their elected
representa ves, more flexibility than a statutory county government. A county
that has not adopted a charter form of government is a statutory county and
can only do what state law permits. By approving a charter government,

Budget Guide
Cuyahoga County Charter
Cuyahoga County now has home rule authority which provides broad power
to do anything not prohibited by state law.
Under statutory government, the three commissioners had administra ve
and legisla ve authority, and the commissioners appointed a County
Administrator to oversee budgetary, personnel, and management func ons
for all departments that were not under separate elected oﬃcials. This
structure did not provide any separa on of powers between the board of
county commissioners and the county administrator.
In contrast, under charter government, the Council has legisla ve and taxing
authority, the County Execu ve has administra ve authority, and the two
represent separate co-equal branches of county government. The 11 Council
members represent 11 districts; no members serve at-large. Many of the du es
formerly performed by independent elected oﬃcials are now performed by
posi ons appointed by the Execu ve, confirmed by Council, and performed
under execu ve and legisla ve oversight.

County Fiscal Oﬃcer
For example, before the Charter took eﬀect, the Auditor, Recorder, and
Treasurer were each separately elected and operated independently. Those
du es are now absorbed by the Execu ve and supervised by the appointed
Fiscal Oﬃcer. A Treasurer is now also appointed and manages the treasury
within the Fiscal Oﬃce. The Fiscal Oﬃcer also oversees the Oﬃce of Budget and
Management, the Board of Revision, the Oﬃce of Procurement and Diversity,
and the Cer ficate of Title Administra on which was formerly a func on of the
elected Clerk of Courts. Likewise, the Department of Human Resources now
serves the employees of agencies that have been absorbed by the Execu ve.

Other Appointed Oﬃcials
In addi on to the Fiscal Oﬃcer and Treasurer, other appointed posi ons
replace elected posi ons including Medical Examiner (replaces Coroner), Clerk
of Courts (replaces elected Clerk of Court),
Director of Public Works (replaces Engineer),
and Sheriﬀ (replaces elected Sheriﬀ). The
Prosecu ng A orney and court judges remain
elected oﬃces.

Oﬃces Created by the Charter
The Charter established several new oﬃces,
and other oﬃces were established by the
Execu ve and Council to support the changes
sought through county reform.

Charter Amendments
In the first years following the adop on of the Charter, the County has amended
several aspects of the Charter to clarify roles and responsibili es.
In 2012, the voters approved a single amendment which requires the County
prepare a biennial (two year) opera ng and capital improvement budget
(Ar cle II, Sec on 2.03 and Ar cle III, sec on 3.09). The County Commissioners
had adopted annual budgets each year prior to Charter Reform.
In 2013, the voters approved several more amendments to further clarify the
roles and responsibili es of Council and various commissions and boards and
the appoin ng authority for members of the commissions and boards:
Appointments: Extend the term during which Council may confirm an
Execu ve appointment to 60 days (Charter Ar cle II, sec on 2.03(2)), allow the
Execu ve to make interim appointments for up to 120 days without Council
confirma on, and legi mize the authority of the interim appointee to act.
Personnel Review Commission: Change the name of the Human Resource
Commission to the Personnel Review Commission to avoid confusion with the
Department of Human Resources; provide Council sole authority to appoint
and remove members of the Personnel Review Commission; and clarify the
administra ve power and du es of the Personnel Review Commission to
Execu ve and non-Execu ve departments and delegates certain responsibili es
between the Human Resource Commission and the Department of Human
Resources (Charter Ar cle II, sec ons 2.03(12), 9.01 through 9.05).
Department of Human Resources: Create a Charter posi on for the Director of
Human Resources to be appointed by the Execu ve and confirmed by Council
(Charter Ar cle II, sec on 9.06).

III-7

Council acƟons: Clarifies that certain ac ons by Council, primarily related to
its internal opera ons, do not require approval by the Execu ve (Ar cle III,
sec on 3.10(5)). The ac ons that no longer require Execu ve approval include
Council commi ees, schedules, rules, hiring, compensa on, and appointments
and confirma ons.
Board of Revision: Creates a single Board of Revision with three members
consis ng of the County Execu ve, an eligible appointment of the Council
President, and either the Fiscal Oﬃcer or the Treasurer, as determined by the
Execu ve. The Amendment authorizes the Board to engage three-person
hearing panels, to hear complaints about property tax valua ons, and requires
the Board to establish merit qualifica ons for the hearing panel members.
The Charter does not require the hearing panels to include county employees.
Board members may not serve on the hearing panels or influence decisions on
individual complaints (Ar cle VI, sec on 6.02).
Legisla on has been proposed (R2013-0164) to oﬀer a Charter Amendment
to the voters to include the Oﬃce of Inspector General in the Charter. The
Execu ve appointed an Inspector General who has been serving since 2011,
but the Charter does not require it.

Conclusion
The County Charter reflects the common concerns at the me of its adop on
by emphasizing ethics, equity, checks and balances, and oversight. The
Charter also responds to concerns about the County’s ability to compete
economically by emphasizing economic well-being and prosperity through
economic development and educa on as well as government streamlining and
collabora on. The Charter form of government allows Cuyahoga County to
use increased flexibility through home rule authority to meet these and other
local priori es.

Budget Guide
Financial and Budgetary Policies
The following policies serve as guides in the decision-making process regarding
the alloca on of County resources. These policies are reviewed annually,
at a minimum. The County’s policies func on as the basis for more refined
and detailed future statements on this County’s financial and budgetary
impera ves. Cuyahoga County strives to operate within these guidelines.

Balancing the Budget
Statement
The County will live within its means. All agencies supported by the resources of
this County must func on within the limits of the financial resources iden fied
or available specifically to accomplish stated programma c objec ves.

Ra onale
A balance must be struck between revenues and expenditures so that the public
can realize the benefits of a strong and stable government. It is important to
understand that this policy is applied to budget en es over periods of me
that extend beyond current appropria ons, most of which are now budgeted
on a biennial basis in accordance with Council Ordinance No. O2011-0036 and
County Charter. By law, appropria on levels cannot exceed available resources,
which are defined as revenues generated in the current period added to cash
balances carried forward from prior years. Temporary shortages, or opera ng
deficits, can and do occur, but they are not tolerated as extended trends.
The County cannot develop structurally unbalanced budgets and expect the
con nued delivery of mandated and con nued services.

Policies
 Appropria on on an All Funds basis is limited to the sum of available
(unencumbered) cash balances and revenues es mated to be received in
the current budget period (calendar year).

III-8

 General Fund expenditures, as well as subsidy appropria ons, for
mandated and priority programs are to be made against current revenue
sources and are not dependent upon uncertain future reserves or prior
period cash balances, which can fluctuate from year to year
 Special Revenue Funds are supported by special levies, fees, grants, or
intergovernmental revenues. Expenditures in these funds are strictly
limited to the mandates of the funding source and the resources available.
Special Revenue Funds are not to be used to subsidize other funds, except
as required or permi ed by program regula ons.
 Enterprise Funds are expected to derive at least 50% of their revenue
from charges and user fees. Enterprises should strive to become selfsuppor ng en es through annual reviews of fee structures, charges for
services, and other opera ng revenues and expenditures.
 Suﬃcient charges and rate schedules shall be levied to support the
opera ons of the Internal Service Funds. Services should be scaled to the
level of support available from these chargebacks; no trend of opera ng
deficits will be allowed. The General Fund may subsidize internal services
beyond the rate structure only to the extent of suppor ng facili es that
cannot be charged to agencies whose funding is program-specific.
 Suﬃcient user charges and fees shall be pursued and levied to support
the full cost (opera ng, direct, indirect and capital) of opera ons. Market
rates and charges levied by other public and private organiza ons for
similar services should be considered when establishing tax rates, fees
and charges.
 New and expanded unrestricted revenue streams should be first applied
to support exis ng programs prior to funding new or expanded programs.
 Mul -year opera ng cost projec ons shall be prepared and updated each
year to iden fy the impact on resources.

Budget Guide
Financial and Budgetary Policies
 A five-year Capital Improvements Program shall be prepared and updated
each year. The opera ng impact of each project shall be iden fied and
incorporated into annual opera ng budgets. Capital assets shall be
purchased and maintained on a regular schedule within legal limits and
the constraints of opera ng budgets, Debt shall be issued for capital
improvements and acquisi ons.

system. The County Execu ve and County Council will review programs
on an as-needed basis and make provision for necessary services.
 To the extent possible, current revenues will fund current opera ons.
The use of unencumbered prior period cash balances in all funds shall be
scru nized and carefully limited.
 All revenue streams will be monitored periodically to determine that they
are maximized and analyzed to determine their sustainability.

Balancing the Budget Funding Public Services
Statement

 Special Revenue Funds will be subsidized by General Fund revenues
(including the Health and Human Services Levy Fund) only to the extent
necessary to draw down these funds, or to support non-mandated
services that the County Execu ve and County Council authorize.

Program demands require that an adequate revenue stream be maintained.
The County must make the hard decisions required to maintain a con nuing
flow of resources.

Ra onale
It is the policy of this government to take the steps necessary to ensure full and
con nued funding for the services, programs, and facili es which the County
is required to provide. Further, the County should ac vely pursue any and all
possible revenue sources to support the services its electorate demands.

Policies
 The County solicits the input of its ci zens in determining its service mix,
and is responsive to that involvement.
 Funding is to be provided for services ranked according to the criteria in
figure BG-1 on page III-4.
 Requests for funding of services for which there is an established Board or
Commission (e.g., Elec ons, Alcohol, Drug Addic on, and Mental Health
Services) should be referred to that Board to be integrated into the
planning and funding focus to facilitate a community-wide, coordinated
III-9

 In an eﬀort to provide the greatest level of services possible to its ci zens,
the County will pursue federal, state, and private grants, but will strictly
limit financial support of these programs to avoid commitments which
con nue beyond the grant’s funding availability.
 County agencies and departments will charge fees for services where
such an approach is permissible and where there is a specific group of
beneficiaries iden fied with the ability to pay.
 The County will con nuously seek to increase and diversify its revenues
in order to limit the dependence on, and overly burden, one or only a few
sources.
 The County shall pursue a program of indirect cost charges and collect
such charges as permi ed by federal and state program alloca ons and
grants.
 The County will not rely on the sale or lease of its property as a material
source of funding for any of its con nuing programs to the extent the
revenue is one- me in nature.

 The County will strive to maintain the ending cash balance reserve to
ensure the con nued orderly opera on of government and provision of
services to residents, and the con nued stability of the tax structure.

Controlling the Cost of Government
Statement

 The County will not rely on reserves to fund con nuing programs.
Reserves should be used for one- me expenditures, such as pilot projects,
equipment upgrades, or unan cipated emergencies. The County will
maintain an encumbrance reserve in the amount equal to the County’s
unpaid obliga ons and unfinished projects at year-end.
 Because of its importance to the County and to all of its member
municipali es, the County’s, Aa1 for general obliga ons and AA3 for
other debt with Moody’s and AA for general obliga ons and AA- for other
debt with Standard & Poor’s bond ra ngs will be maintained and, as
controlled condi ons permit, preserved. Adherence to these financial
and budgetary policies aides in maintaining the County’s superior bond
ra ngs.
 The County’s tax base shall be preserved; any eﬀort to selec vely narrow
or contract that base shall be supported only if its purpose conforms to
the County’s defini on of high priority.

The County ensures that the funds provided by cons tuents are invested in
services that are delivered both eﬀec vely and eﬃciently through CountyStat,
a performance management strategy employed by the County Execu ve that
emphasizes data tracking and analysis as a tool for making decisions. The
Department Performance sec on of this Budget Plan includes a discussion
on CountyStat, as well as the performance plans (goals, objec ves, and key
performance indicators) for the County agencies.

Ra onale
Government is charged with delivering services supported by the taxpayers.
The incen ve to expend funds prudently, by maintaining a balance between
quality and service capacity, is that more can be done only when resources
become available. To the greatest extent possible, funding for ineﬀec ve
ac vi es will be minimized so that resources are redirected to programs and
services that directly influence the quality of life for County ci zens.

eﬀort should be made to reduce the amount of absenteeism, paid overme, and, when possible, the number of employees while con nuing to
increase both the eﬃciency and eﬀec veness of service delivery.
 County agencies and departments will increase and enhance technology
as a means of increasing eﬃciency and eﬀec veness while reducing personnel expenses and other costs.

Debt Management Policies
Financing long-term capital improvements o en requires the issuance of debt.
Depending on the type of capital improvement, various debt instruments are
available to the County. As stated previously, the County’s financial policies
dictate a balanced approach to financing capital improvements: one that
considers capital improvement financing in terms of the County’s capacity to
pay for that debt, while maintaining its long-term financial strength.

 The County will maintain a segregated Bond Re rement Fund to provide
for principal and interest payments.

The Debt Management sec on of the Budget Plan lists the debt indicators,
discusses the types of debt the County issues, as well as its outstanding
debt, and explains the voted and unvoted debt limita ons. This sec on also
comments on the County’s credit ra ng history and reiterates the County’s
debt policies, which include:

 The proceeds from the sale of bonds and notes will not be used for operaons, other than tax an cipa on or current revenue notes that mature
during the same year of issue. Bond premiums generated from the debt
sale will be placed in the Debt Service Fund.

 An Annual Informa onal Statement will be prepared so that current financial, economic, and demographic informa on is disclosed to investors, ra ng agencies, and the public.
 The County will adhere to the direct and indirect debt limita ons of the
State of Ohio (ORC Chapter 133).
 The County will analyze capital funding alterna ves before a decision to
sell debt is made. Pay-as-you-go planning will be u lized to fund projects
in ancipa on of debt issuance.
 The County will sell notes instead of bonds only when market condi ons
dictate or as part of a mul -step construc on program.

III-13

 Bonds will be rated when sold to secure the most favorable market interest rate. Notes will be rated when it is determined to be financially
advantageous.

 County Council code sec ons 7.06 and 7.07 require a General Fund and
Health and Human Services Levy Fund cash reserve to current year expenditures ra o of 25% and 10%, respec vely. This policy is included in
the County’s strategy to improve its bond ra ngs in order to obtain the
lowest interest rates on borrowing.
 The County will u lize the Asset Liability Management (ALM) approach
to managing risk and will include updates on the County debt por olio
and planned issuance ac vity as part of the quarterly County Investment
Advisory Commi ee mee ng.
 The County does not u lize deriva ve products such as interest rate
swaps in conjunc on with outstanding or newly issued debt. A change in
this policy will require the County to dra a detailed swap policy as well
as retain a swap advisor for any such transac on.

Budget Guide
Capital Improvement Financial Policies
Improving and expanding the County’s capital assets require the investment
of significant resources. These expenditures, however, greatly benefit the
County and its ci zens by extending the useful life of its assets and providing
new assets. Decisions regarding the financing of capital improvements impact
the availability of resources for both daily opera ons and future capital
improvements. Funding decisions must be made in light of short and long
term resources and coincide with the life and cost of the assets. The following
policies guide the capital improvement planning process:
 The County Execu ve and County Council will balance the need for both
maintenance of capital assets and provision of direct services to ci zens.
 The County will maintain capital funding at sustainable levels, will avoid
deferring maintenance to cut costs, and will not neglect the County’s
capital inventory.
 The County will only commit to capital projects within its ability to finance
improvements using short and long term resources. Debt issuance to
finance capital improvements is based on the County’s debt limita on at
the me of issuance and the ability to service the debt over the issue’s life
without jeopardizing tax dollars for opera ng requirements.

III-14

 Financing decisions must balance pay as you go financing (current resources) versus long term financing (debt). The use of current resources
to finance capital improvements represents restraint in incurring long
term obliga ons. The General Fund will annually subsidize a designated
por on of general capital improvements, usually limited to smaller projects that do not exceed $300,000. At the same me, financing decisions
will consider the improvement’s useful life and allocate capital costs over
their useful life. This method ensures that funded projects provide the
most benefit.
 The County Execu ve and County Council will promote and encourage
the leveraging of resources to maximize capital improvement eﬀorts.
This includes intergovernmental programs, public/private partnerships,
service charges and user fees, and debt issuance.
 Capital improvement decisions must consider the impact on opera ng
and maintenance costs to ensure the County’s ability and capacity to
maintain the capital asset. To highlight this long term factor, the Capital
Improvement Plan will be considered concurrently with the Biennial Opera ng Budget.

For purposes of this Policy, the County’s total average por olio will be equal
to the average investment balance for the 12 month period ending one
month prior to the current month, except for the following cash equivalent
investments, indicated by an * (Overnight Repurchase Agreements, Bank
Deposits (excluding CDs), STAR Ohio, and Money Market Mutual Funds), where
the total average por olio will be equal to the prior day’s por olio market
value.

Maximum Maturity
Maintenance of adequate liquidity to meet the cash flow needs of the County is
essen al. Accordingly, the por olio will be structured in a manner that ensures
suﬃcient cash is available to meet an cipated liquidity needs. Selec on of
investment maturi es must be consistent with the cash requirements of the
County in order to avoid the forced sale of securi es prior to maturity.
For purposes of this investment policy, assets of the County shall be segregated
into two categories based on expected liquidity needs and purposes -- shortterm funds and the long-term por olio. Assets categorized as short-term funds
will be invested in permi ed investments maturing in six (6) months or less.
The average weighted maturity of the short-term assets will not exceed 30
days. The long-term por olio will be invested in permi ed investments with a
stated maturity of no more than 5 years from the date of purchase unless the
security is matched to a specific obliga on or debt of the County. The purchase
of any security with a maturity of greater than five (5) years must be approved
in advance by the Investment Advisory Commi ee. To control the vola lity of

III-19

Budget Guide
Investment Management Policies
the long-term por olio, the County Execu ve will determine a dura on target
for the por olio, not to exceed three years.
Notwithstanding these limita ons, in no case will the assets in either category
be invested in securi es with a term to maturity that exceeds the expected
disbursement date of those funds. These maturity limits shall not be construed
to limit agreements made pursuant to the county’s heritage home loan program
to renew cer ficates of deposit linked to eligible loans having a maturity of up
to ten years.

Prohibited Investments and Investment Prac ces
The County is expressly prohibited from the following investments and investment prac ces. This is not an exclusive list.
1. Borrowing funds for the sole purpose of reinves ng the proceeds
of such borrowing;
2. Issuing taxable Tax or Current Revenue An cipa on Notes for the
sole purpose of inves ng the proceeds;
3. Investment in reverse repurchase agreements;
4. Short sales (selling a specific security before it has been legally
purchased);
5. Pair-oﬀs (buying a security and selling it before the se lement
date);
6. Specula ve trading (repe ve buying and selling of the same or
similar securi es for the purpose of capital gains); and
7. Investment in securi es commonly known as deriva ves, structured notes, or trusts collateralized by Treasury obliga ons. A treasury infla on protected security shall not be considered a derivave, provided the security matures not later than five years a er
purchase.

Monitoring and Adjus ng the Por olio
Those responsible for the day-to-day management of the County por olio will
rou nely monitor the contents of the por olio, as detailed in the Cuyahoga
County Treasurer’s Cash Management Procedures Manual, the available
markets and the rela ve values of compe ng instruments, and will adjust the
por olio as necessary to meet the investment objec ves listed above. It is
recognized and understood that this non-specula ve ac ve management of
por olio holdings may cause a book loss on the sale of an owned investment.
It is the policy of the County to charge any such loss against the interest
income account during the month in which the loss was booked. Losses shall
be allocated to the various funds based on the propor onate fund equity in the
total por olio based on the average daily balance during the month in which
the sale occurred. Losses shall only be posted to those funds that can legally
accept them.

Internal Controls
The County Execu ve shall establish and be responsible for monitoring a
system of internal controls governing the administra on and management
of the County por olio, and these controls shall be documented in wri ng.
Such controls shall be designed to prevent and control losses of the County
funds arising from fraud, employee error, misrepresenta on by third par es,
unan cipated changes in financial markets, or imprudent ac ons by any
personnel. The internal controls will address: control of collusion, separa on of
du es, separa ng transac on authority from accoun ng and record keeping,
custodial safekeeping, clear delega on of authority, wri en confirma on of
telephone transac ons, minimizing the number of authorized investment
oﬃcials and documenta on of investment transac ons.
As part of the annual audit of County government, the County Execu ve shall
have the investment program reviewed by the Auditor of the State of Ohio
or other qualified audi ng firm. This audit will be designed to establish asset
and liability valua ons and measure compliance with the County investment
policies and procedures. The results of each audit will be disclosed at an open

III-20

Budget Guide
Investment Management Policies
mee ng of the County Execu ve and County Council. The County Execu ve
and County Council may periodically seek addi onal examina ons of the
investment program at its discre on and may contract with an independent
firm to audit the County Investment Program.

Bank Selec on and Review
The County shall select a depository bank and a custodial bank a er issuing a
request for proposals and evalua ng the ability of proposing banks to provide
necessary services, adequacy of capital or net worth of the financial ins tu ons
as well as pricing for individual services. The depository shall provide collateral
for the County deposits in accordance with requirements for public funds
deposits in Ohio. The selected depository and custodial banks shall provide
updated financial informa on to the County on an as requested basis and, at
least, annually.

Eligible Banks and Broker/Dealers
The Investment Advisory Commi ee will establish and maintain a list of eligible
brokers, dealers, and banks with which investment transac ons can be made.
These financial ins tu ons will be selected by creditworthiness (minimum
capital requirement of $10,000,000 and at least five years of opera on, or, if
the firm has its primary place of business in Cuyahoga County, minimum capital
as required by Securi es and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 and at least
ten years in opera on). Qualified firms will be limited to “primary” dealers
and other dealers that qualify under Securi es and Exchange Commission
Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule.) Wri en procedures will describe the
selec on process.
All brokers, dealers and other financial ins tu ons conduc ng investment
business, ini a ng transac ons, or execu ng transac ons ini ated by the
County, having read this policy shall sign the Investment Policy thereby
acknowledging their comprehension and receipt. Current financial statements
of eligible banks and broker/dealers shall be kept on file at the County. In
addi on, all financial ins tu ons interested in transac ng securi es trades

with the County are required to complete a “Broker/Dealer Request for
Informa on” as detailed in the Appendix to this policy.
The County Execu ve may enter into a wri en investment or deposit
agreement that includes a provision under which the par es agree to submit
to non-binding arbitra on to se le any controversy that may arise out of the
agreement including the loss of public moneys resul ng from investment or
deposit.

Compe

ve Selec on of Investment Instruments

It will be the policy of the County to transact all securi es purchase/sales only
with approved financial ins tu ons through a formal and compe ve process
requiring the solicita on and evalua on of at least three bids/oﬀers. The
County will accept the oﬀer which (a) has the highest rate of return within the
maturity required; and (b) op mizes the investment objec ve of the overall
por olio. When selling a security, the County will select the bid that generates
the highest sale price. If there is a e bid between one or more brokers, the
County Execu ve, with the approval of County Council, will award the winning
bid to the brokers on a rota ng basis.
It will be the responsibility of the personnel involved with each purchase/sale
to produce and retain wri en records of each transac on including the name
of the financial ins tu ons solicited, rate quoted, descrip on of the security,
investment selected, and any special considera ons that had an impact on
the decision. If the lowest priced security (highest yield) was not selected
for purchase, an explana on describing the ra onale will be included in this
record.
Primary fixed price Federal Agency oﬀerings may be purchased from the list
of qualified broker/dealers without compe ve solicita on. However, before
purchasing any primary fixed price agency oﬀering, the County Execu ve
will evaluate the appropriateness of the oﬀering as it relates to comparable
investments. If it is determined that agency obliga ons mee ng the County’s
requirements are available in the secondary market at a higher yield, then

procedures.

ve bidding

In making investment decisions, all other things being equal and subject to
compliance with any applicable Internal Revenue Code requirements for bond
proceeds, investment in corpora ons and financial ins tu ons doing business
in the State of Ohio will be given preference over other investment op ons.

Investment of Bond Proceeds
The resolu ons providing for the payment of presently outstanding debt of the
County impose certain restric ons on the investment of funds pledged to the
payment of principal, interest and other costs associated with the bonds. Those
funds established by the provisions of the bond resolu ons will be managed
in accordance with the terms and condi ons of the bond covenants if those
requirements are more restric ve than this investment policy.

Appropriate County oﬃcials and representa ves of the Custodian responsible
for, or in any manner involved with, the safekeeping and custody process of
the County shall be bonded to such a degree as to protect the County against
losses from malfeasance and misfeasance.

Performance Standards
The investment por olio shall be designed and managed with the objec ve of
obtaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles,
commensurate with the investment risk constraints and cash flow needs of
the County. Short-term funds will be compared to the return on the threemonth U. S. Treasury Bill and an ins tu onal money market mutual fund with
comparable investment restric ons. The long-term por olio will be compared
to an index of U. S. Treasury securi es having a similar dura on or other
appropriate benchmark.

Repor ng
The County intends to comply with all applicable sec ons of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, Arbitrage Rebate Regula ons and bond covenants with
regard to the investment of bond proceeds.

Safekeeping and Custody
All investment securi es purchased by the County or held as collateral on
either deposits or investments shall be held in third-party safekeeping at a
financial ins tu on (to be designated as the “Custodian”) qualified to act in this
capacity. All securi es held for the County account will be held free and clear
of any lien and all transac ons will be conducted on a delivery-vs.-payment
basis. All purchases and sales will be transacted on a cash, regular (next day) or
“skip-day” se lement basis. The Custodian shall issue a safekeeping receipt to
the County lis ng the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other per nent
informa on. On a monthly basis, the custodian will also provide reports which
list all securi es held for the County, the book value of holdings and the market
value as of month-end.

The County Treasurer shall maintain accurate, complete, and mely records of
all investment ac vi es. Within ten (10) business days of the end of the month,
the County Execu ve shall submit an investment report to the Investment
Advisory Commi ee and the Working Group of the Investment Advisory
Commi ee each month. This report shall include: (i) a lis ng of the exis ng
por olio in terms of investment securi es, amor zed book value, maturity
date, return, market value and other features deemed relevant and (ii) a lis ng
of all transac ons executed during the month. The market values presented in
these reports will be consistent with accoun ng guidelines in GASB Statement
31 pertaining to the valua on of investments and the treatment of unrealized
gains/losses. The report will also include a statement that the investment of
the County por olio is in compliance with this Policy and any applicable bond
resolu ons.
The County Treasurer shall also prepare quarterly and annual reports in
suﬃcient detail to provide full disclosure of all investment ac vi es to the
Investment Advisory Commi ee and the general public.

Budget Management Process
The County is ac vely engaged in budget management throughout the year.
The policies and procedures that dictate how the budget is developed and
monitored have been refined slightly following Cuyahoga County’s transi on
to a charter form of government: replacing the three-person Board of
Commissioners, who had served both the execu ve and legisla ve func ons,
with an elected County Execu ve and an 11-member County Council.

County’s fiscal year coincides with the January – December calendar year. The
development of the County budget can be summarized by three major steps:
 Base budget development
 Execu ve’s Recommended Budget
 Council Budget Hearings

Statutory Requirements for Budget Development and Repor ng

 Adop on of County Budget by Council

Based on Resolu on 02011-0036, approved by the County Council, the County
Execu ve is required to submit a proposed opera ng budget to the Council for
the upcoming year which contains the following:
 A statement of es mated revenues by source and a statement of
proposed expenditures by department, oﬃce, agency, authority, board
and commission

The development of the following year’s opera ng budgets (eﬀec ve January
1) begins the previous June when the required Tax Budget is prepared. The Tax
Budget must be in the hands of the County Budget Commission by July 20. The
Tax Budget has the following significant a ributes:
 It provides an es mate for the Real Estate and Tangible Personal Property
Tax rates.

 A schedule of es mated revenues and proposed expenditures for each
County department, oﬃce, agency, authority, board and commission, on
a monthly basis, and
 A summary of the contents of the proposed opera ng budget

 It provides the basis for the County’s oﬃcial Cer ficate of Es mated Resources. By law the County cannot adopt an appropria ons budget which
exceeds the Cer ficate. This document establishes the outside limits on
spending.

 Capital improvements scheduled for, or proposed to be undertaken within
that fiscal year, along with the es mated costs of each improvement and
the method of financing, plus the next five succeeding years

 It establishes the share of the State Local Government Fund received by
the County in the budget year. The County’s alloca on has been kept at
30% of the total distribu on.

 A wri en message to Council explaining the budget in detail
including financial policies, major changes in expenditures, revenues,
appropria ons, and an itemiza on of the proposed capital improvements
 A five year financial forecast for the general opera ng funds of the County

Budget Development
Resolu on R2011-0291 establishes the biennial budget process that includes
an opera ng budget and capital improvements with an annual update to
be approved by the County Council in the odd numbered year. Cuyahoga

The approval of the Tax Budget coincides with the annual Midyear Review
conducted by the Oﬃce of Budget and Management (OBM). OBM prepares
financial forecasts – including a detailed analysis of revenue, expenses, and
programma c ac vity – on a quarterly basis. The 2nd quarter (Midyear),
prepared in July, is par cularly important as the future year es mate included
in the 2nd quarter review serves as the ini al base budget for the following
year. For example, the 2014 ini al base budget was the 2013 midyear es mate
for 2014.

Ini al base budgets are modified as needed by OBM staﬀ based on new

sent to agencies for review and comment. Significant errors or omissions are
corrected prior to the finaliza on of the base budget, which is the backdrop
against which decision package items – requests for new or addi onal funding
– are considered.
Following the finaliza on of the base budget, the Execu ve’s Oﬃce meets with
County agencies (required for Execu ve agencies, requested of Other Elected
Oﬃcials) to review the base budget, their performance plan for the following
year, and to discuss any decision package items that have been requested.
OBM amends the base budget as needed based on these mee ngs (e.g. if a

The budget can be amended in one of three ways: increasing appropria on,
decreasing appropria on, or transferring appropria on from one budget
en ty to another. The la er can involve transferring appropria on from one
character (i.e. budget category, such as salaries or contracts) within the same
index code or from one index code (in the same agency or between agencies)
to another. Appropria on can only be transferred, however, between index
codes that are in the same subfund.

A budget is a spending plan predicated on es mates and assump ons. From
me to me, these assump ons change. The plan, then, must be amended
to accommodate the changes, whether they are award of a new grant, and
increase or decrease in funding levels, or the approval of new or expanded
programs. The need to amend the budget is usually made evident during
OBM’s monthly (cursory) or quarterly (detailed) reviews or at the agency’s
ini a ve based on need. For example, the Health and Human Services Division
of Children and Family Services may request either addi onal funding or a
transfer of appropria on to support an increase in the number of children in

In order to increase es mated revenue, clear evidence of a new or increased
revenue source or the need to revise a projec on must exist. This usually
consists of an alloca on le er or other wri en documenta on, or a trend
analysis that jus fies a change. Requests for increases originate in the OBM
for the General Fund and in various agencies or departments for most other
funds. OBM prepares the necessary forms for any changes in the Cer ficate of
Resources, the document that establishes appropria on limits, and no fies the
Fiscal Oﬃce of its recommenda ons.

Appropria on Adjustment

Appropria on Transfers

Adjustments involve the transfer of appropria on within the same index
code and within the same character. For example, adjustments can involve
moving appropria on from salaries to benefits, both of which are within the
Personal Services character. Another example might be moving appropria on
from supplies to contracts, both of which are in the Other Expenses character.
Appropria on adjustments require the approval of OBM, but do not require the
approval of County Council as the Council adopts the budget at the character
level.

Transfers involve moving appropria on between index codes within the same
agency’s budget (usually reflects a shi of funding from one division to another),
and/or transferring appropria on from one character to another (e.g. from
salaries to capital outlay), or from one agency to another agency, provided they
are in the same subfund (e.g. between two agencies that are both supported
by the General Fund). Appropria on transfers represent a change from the
budget adopted by County Council and, as a result, require Council’s approval.
OBM submits requests to Council to amend the budget (dubbed “fiscal items”)
every two weeks. The fiscal agenda is approved by Council via the current rules
established for approving legisla on.

Financial Structure and Repor ng Rela onships
The County adopts budgets for a number of agencies and departments,
including a variety of func ons and programs, funds and subfunds, and
characters, or revenue and cost summary categories. The reports presented
throughout the Budget Plan sort the data according to the organiza ons being
examined, the services being delivered, and/or the accoun ng en es under
scru ny.
In proceeding through the Budget Plan, it is important to note that financial
informa on is provided for comparison purposes only. These are not and
should not be construed as the financial statements of the County, which are
presented in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR), which is
prepared by the Fiscal Oﬃce’s Financial Repor ng division. Not only are the
budge ng and accoun ng methods vastly diﬀerent, but the repor ng en es
diﬀer as well.
The major diﬀerence between the budget basis and the Generally Accepted
Accoun ng Principals (GAAP) basis method of accoun ng is that the budget
basis measures current resources: revenues are recorded when received as
opposed to when they become measurable and available. Expenditures are
recorded when paid, as opposed to when they are incurred. Encumbered
amounts are treated as expenditures

through court order – a “reasonable” budget that diﬀers from the one approved
by Council to ensure suﬃcient funding to operate the courts. While there is
legal recourse for Council to oppose this, the burden of unreasonableness rests
with Council.
Council’s authority as it relates to the independent Boards and Commissions
vary. For some, it has full appropria ng authority, such as the Board of Elec ons
and the Veterans’ Services Commission. For others, the ability to control
spending is confined to the provision of opera ng subsidies (e.g. MetroHealth,
Alcohol, Drug Addic on, and Mental Health Services Board).
The organiza ons listed below are not included in either the appropria ons
measure or component units within the CAFR. These en es, except for
the General Health District, are classified as separate corporate and poli cal
governmental en es under Ohio law. In each case the County does not
exercise management or financial oversight responsibility and does not
influence daily opera ons, approve budgets, or provide substan al funding.
 Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority - conducts port development
and opera ons
 Cleveland Metropolitan Park District - maintains and operates a park and
land reserve district
 Cuyahoga Community College - provides higher educa on opportuni es

The Organiza onal Budget En ty
Cuyahoga County budgets for the County Execu ve and the departments
under his authority, other Elected Oﬃcials (e.g. the County Prosecutor, and
the Courts) and independent Boards and Commissions (e.g. the Board of
Developmental Disabili es and the Board of Elec ons).
The County Council has the full authority to appropriate funds for Execu ve
agencies and the other elected oﬃcials. Although the County Council has full
authority to appropriate funds for other Elected Oﬃcials, their approval of
specific expenditures by these oﬃcials is not required. Further, as a co-equal
branch of government, the judiciary is vested with the ability to demand –

 Cuyahoga County Public Library District - operates and maintains a countywide public library system
 Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority - provides public housing
services
 Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority - operates and maintains a

 Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District - operates and maintains a storm
and sanitary sewer system
 Cuyahoga County Board of Health - provides public health services

Budget Guide
Financial Structure and Repor ng Rela onships
Measurement Focus and Basis of Accoun ng for Repor ng Purposes
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accoun ng, as are the
proprietary fund (i.e. Enterprise and Internal Service Funds) and fiduciary fund
financial statements. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are
recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the ming of related cash
flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenue in the year for which they are
levied. State and local government fund shared revenues are recognized when
the provider government recognizes its liability to the County. Grants and
similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements
imposed by the provider have been met.
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current
financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of
accoun ng. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and
available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collec ble
within the current period or soon enough therea er to pay liabili es of the
current period. For this purpose, the government considers revenues to be
available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal
period. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as
under accrual accoun ng. However, debt service expenditures, as well as
expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are
recorded only when payment is due.

Property taxes, sales and use taxes, other tax, state local government funds,
licenses and permits and interest associated with the current fiscal period are
all considered to be suscep ble to accrual and so have been recognized as
revenues of the current fiscal period. Only the por on of special assessments
receivable due within the current fiscal period is considered to be suscep ble
to accrual as revenue of the current period. All other revenue items are
considered to be measurable and available only when the government receives
cash.

Aﬃrma on of County’s Budget and Financial Processes
The County has been awarded the Cer ficate of Achievement for Excellence in
Financial Repor ng by the Government Finance Oﬃcers Associa on (GFOA) of
the United States and Canada for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
every year since the fiscal year ending December 31, 1983, except for 1993.
The County has also received the Dis nguished Budget Presenta on Award
from the GFOA each year that it has submi ed since 1988. The County takes
great pride in these achievements and fully intends to produce the CAFR and
Budget Plan in this and succeeding years in conformance with the highest
possible standards.

Revenue Analysis

The Revenue Analysis secƟon provides an in-depth look at the County’s eight major revenue categories. The Property
Taxes category is covered in great detail. If you have ever wondered what a mill is, the ten-mill limitaƟon, legal and effecƟve millage rates, or why the State pays part of your property tax bill, you’ll find the answers here. What is the “use”
tax as opposed to the “sales” tax? What is the State form of revenue sharing? Types of Intergovernmental revenue and
programs such as public assistance, job training, community development and aging are described. Charges for Services, Licenses and Permits, Fines and Forfeitures, Investment Earnings and Miscellaneous revenues are explained, also.

Revenue Analysis
The Revenue Analysis sec on of the 2014 Budget Plan includes detailed
informa on on the various sources of revenue included in Cuyahoga
County’s All Funds budget. An analysis of revenue is cri cal to gaining
an understanding of and apprecia on for County opera ons.
The amount of revenue available to the County is influenced by several
factors, such as the poli cal climate, the economy, and the County’s
eﬃciency and eﬀec veness.
Intergovernmental alloca ons, for
example, that flow to the County from the State or Federal governments
may be impacted by either the controlling poli cal party or the current
pressing policy issues. The economy significantly aﬀects the majority
of County revenue, specifically property taxes (27% of total revenue)
and sales & use taxes (18.8% of total revenue). Cuyahoga County’s
property tax collec ons are expected to rebound and stabilize over the
next few years resul ng from the come back from the foreclosure crisis
and that resulted in a decline in property valua on over the past few
years. Finally, the amount of revenue generated can fluctuate based
on the a en on paid by County agencies and the judicious pursuit of
charges and fees owed to the County, which o en may require a change
in business prac ces.
As is o en the case in the public sector, revenue drives the decisionmaking process. Not only because elected leaders and policy makers can
only work with the resources available to them, but also because many
revenue sources – par cularly those that flow from other government
sources – have coinciding mandates that dictate to the County what must
be done (i.e. program or service delivery) with that funding. The County’s
elected leaders have discre on over only a por on of total revenue,
which presents a challenge when trying to implement new programs
or ideas to respond to our County’s specific needs. The responsibility,
therefore, rests with all County staﬀ to make the most of the County’s
limited resources by maximizing non-local funding sources (e.g. federal
IV-1

en tlements), reducing outstanding obliga ons and delinquencies
(e.g. court costs, property taxes), and closely observing performance to
ensure that County dollars are being spent eﬀec vely, responsibly, and
with considera on for eﬃciency and innova on.

Revenue Analysis
The Revenue Analysis sec on details the revenue that flows into
the budget, enabling the various County agencies to implement the
programs and services described in the Program Budgets sec on of this
Budget Plan. The County’s 2014/2015 biennial budget adopted by the
11-member County Council an cipates revenue totaling $1.3 billion in
year 2014 and 2015.

$350.0

As can be seen in the table below, the County’s revenue is very much
diverse: no one source represents more than 27% of the total. While
diversity is generally an indicator of financial health, much of the
revenue that flows into the budget is restricted, which leaves the County
vulnerable to fluctua ons in its unrestricted funding sources, such as the
Local Government Fund, Sales Tax, select fees, and investment earnings.
Restricted revenue is segregated into Special Revenue Funds, discussed
in detail in the Fund Budgets sec on of this Plan.
The County operates under the directorial principle that revenue drives
the budget. Cuyahoga County is commi ed to opera ng within the
resources available to it and, as a result, is diligent in its analysis and
monitoring of revenue. This sec on will briefly describe the County’s
major sources of revenue and explain the assump ons behind the
es mates included in the 2014-2015 budget.
Intergovernmental (25.0% of total revenue)
Intergovernmental revenue is funding that flows into the County budget
from other government sources. Please note that this discussion
includes the County’s alloca on from the State’s Local Government
Fund, which is reflected separately in the Adopted Budget Schedules.
Intergovernmental revenue is es mated to total $323.4 million in

The major sources of Cuyahoga County’s Intergovernmental revenue
include:
Local Government Fund – This alloca on from
the State is budgeted at $16.9 million and
$17.1 million in 2014 and 2015, respec vely.
The 2014 figure is down 30.9% from the 2013
actual of $29.3 million. The decrease in 2014
reflects the con nued cut in the State’s biennial
budget that became eﬀec ve July 2011. The
Local Government Fund represents less than
1.3% of the County’s total All Funds revenue and 5.2% of General Fund
Opera ng revenue.

Public Assistance – There are a number of alloca ons that flow to the
County from the State in support of the many social service and selfsuﬃciency programs oﬀered via the County’s Department of Human
Services. Due to the inter-connectedness of the various County agencies,
many of the aforemen oned intergovernmental revenue streams
support mul ple agencies that work collabora vely toward a common
goal. These alloca on amounts included in the budget are based on
no ces from the State and include, but are not limited to:
 Temporary Assistance to Needy
Families/Title XX - $32.9 million
in 2013 – provides funding for
a number of social services
including
increasing

IV-3

Revenue Analysis
The 2014 budget includes a $1.5 million reduc on in Title IV-E revenue.
The loss of Title IV-E dollars is somewhat oﬀset by $3.4 million increase
in TANF funding available for administering public assistance programs.
Overall Public Assistance funding totals $105.4 million in 2014 and 2015,
making up approximately 32.6% of total Intergovernmental revenue.
This revenue is recorded in the various Public Assistance funds that
capture the ac vity of the Health and Human Services agencies (e.g.
Children and Family Services, Employment and Family Services, Senior
and Adult Services, Homeless
Services and Family and Children
First Council). The Public Assistance
funds are discussed in greater detail
in the Fund Budgets sec on of this
Plan.

PublicDefender’s

State Public Defender – Coun es are
required to provide legal counsel to
individuals who lack the means to secure an
a orney on their own. In Cuyahoga County
this is accomplished two ways: assignment
of a staﬀ a orney from the Public Defender’s
Oﬃce or the assignment of a private a orney
who is paid on a per case basis according to
the prescribed fee schedule. Approximately 20% of cases are assigned
to the Public Defender, versus 80% to assigned counsel.
The State Public Defender reimburses coun es for expenses related to
indigent defense at the rate of 40%. The budget includes approximately
$10.7 million for Public Defender expenses to defend adult and juvenile
individuals. At 40% reimbursement, this level of spending would
generate approximately $4.2 million in reimbursement revenue. A 30%
increase from 2013 actual expenditures of $7.8 million, included in these
cost are the following;
 Common Pleas - Assigned Counsel 2013 expenses $4,832,262

 Ohio Department of Developmental Disabili es Reimbursement,
Ohio Department of Educa on grant and Title XX.
To support early childhood programs, two schools for the developmentally
and physically disabled, eight adult ac vity centers serving over 2,500
adults, and 58 group homes serve 404 residents. Revenue that supports
the County’s Board of Developmental Disabili es accounts for more
than a quarter of Intergovernmental revenue in the 2014-2015 budgets.

to the County through two alloca ons: Administra on and
Maintenance. The Administra on alloca on is the larger
of the two and provides reimbursement for administra ve
expenses (including salary and benefits) and Maintenance
provides reimbursement for the actual cost of subs tute

Title IV-D – The County generates revenue through Title IV-D of the Social Security Act for its ac vi es rela ve to the establishment and enforcement of child support, including the establishment of paternity.
This Federal en tlement flows to the County from the State Department
of Health and Human Services and reimburses the County for eligible
expenses at the rate of 66%. IV-D revenue is the largest source of revenue for the Cuyahoga County Child Support
Enforcement Agency (CSEA) and through contrac ng significantly supports the opera ons
of Domes c Rela ons Court, Juvenile Court,
and to a lesser extent the Fiscal Oﬃce (for the
processing of cash child support payments).

calculated at 66% of eligible expenses in CSEA, as well as Domes c and
Juvenile Courts. Title IV-D reimbursement generated by the Courts is
revenue to the County’s General Fund. Total funding from Title IV-D accounts for 5.5% of total Intergovernmental revenue and is es mated at
$17.9 million each in 2014 and 2015. The Courts’ share of IV-D revenue
is held flat in 2014-2015.
Property Taxes (27.0% of total revenue)
Revenue generated through property taxes
represents just less than a third of total revenue. The County is required to update taxable
property values every three years to reflect
current market values: this was last completed
in 2012; the next update will be completed in
2015. A complete reappraisal of every parcel
of property must be completed every six years: this was last completed
in 2012. The 2014 budget includes expenses associated with the Countywide reappraisal of real property. Collec on on the updated values will
IV-6

Revenue Analysis
begin in 2014. The total 2013 assessed valuaƟon for collecƟon in 2014
is $27,694,841,450.
Local property tax rates are computed in mills. One mill is the equivalent of $1 of tax for each $1,000 in assessed value. The assessed value is
calculated by mul plying the es mated market value of the property by
35%. For example, a home with an es mated market value of $100,000
has an assessed value of $35,000 ($100,000*0.35). Based on this assessed value, one mill would generate $35 in tax ($35,000*.001).
In Ohio there are two types of millage: inside and outside. Inside millage is provided by the State Cons tu on and is levied without a vote.
Public schools, ci es, coun es, and other en es are allocated a por on
of the inside mills. Inside millage is limited to 10 mills in each poli cal
subdivision, many of which overlap (e.g. school districts spanning mulple ci es).

Once a poli cal subdivision has reached its 10-mill limit,
no overlapping en ty has available millage regardless of
their specific rates. For example, the City of Cleveland
Heights, the City of University Heights, and the Cleveland Heights-University Heights (CH-UH) School District
are all limited to the same 10 mills. The current allocaon of the inside millage in those two municipali es is:
City of Cleveland Heights
1.5 - for the County
3.72 - City of Cleveland Heights
4.45 - CH-UH School District
9.67 - Total Inside Millage

City of University Heights
1.5 for the County
4.05 - City of University Heights
4.45 - CH-UH School District
10.0 - Total Inside Millage

While it appears that the City of Cleveland Heights has 0.33 in available
inside millage that could be used for the benefit of either the City or
the CH-UH School District, because the City of University Heights has
reached the 10 mill limit, both the City of Cleveland Heights and the CHUH School District are blocked from increasing their share of inside millage. The overwhelming majority of poliƟcal subdivisions in Cuyahoga
County have reached the 10-mill limit.
The alloca on of millage within ci es may vary based on the school district that serves the property. For example, while the majority of the
City of Cleveland is within the boundaries of the Cleveland Municipal
School District, parts of the City feed into the Berea City Schools and
parts feed into the Shaker Heights Schools. Inside millage, therefore,
for these residents will be allocated diﬀerently, as detailed in the table
below:

If one is reviewing the rates for a par cular subdivision that don’t add
up to 10, it is important to review the alloca on for any overlapping
en es because likely one of them has reached the 10-mill limit. In the
case of Cleveland Heights, for example, one could also look at the City of
East Cleveland and the East Cleveland School District as they also overlap with the CH-UH School District and the City of Cleveland Heights,

RA-5 - Voted Millage

Outside millage is levied by a vote of the public. Poli cal subdivisions
may seek the support of the voters for outside millage when they have
reached their 10-mill inside millage limit but have determined that addi onal funding is needed to maintain or expand services to residents.
Cuyahoga County voters have generously approved support for the
following:

It should be noted that the MetroParks are allocated 0.05 mills from
the County’s share of inside millage for a total to the MetroParks of 2.80
mills. This reduces the share of inside millage that the County receives to
support opera ons to 1.45 mills. The table above cannot be interpreted
as an exhaus ve lis ng of all approved levies for Cuyahoga County voters, but rather just the ones that are County-wide. Voters in certain
municipali es may have approved addi onal outside millage to support
an ac vity or agency within that jurisdic on. For example, residents of
Cleveland Heights and University Heights support a special levy for the
CH-UH public library: this addi onal tax represents approximately 5% of
total taxes paid for homeowners in those ci es.
Cuyahoga County has one of the highest rates of eﬀec ve millage, yet
is comparable among other coun es of similar demographics within the
State of Ohio: this includes both inside and outside millage. See compara ve analysis below (source: Ohio Department of Taxa on)

Health and Human Services Levies
2015Property TaxesbyFund

Included in the Property Tax es mate is revenue generated via outside
millage: two levies approved by the voters to supplement spending
in the health and human services. Combined, these two levies are
esƟmated to account for revenue totaling $230.6 million in 2014 and
$230.2 million in 2015. An increase in 2014 reflects the voted renewal
and increase of the 2.9 mill levy, passed in 2013 as a renewed rate of 3.9
mill levy.
The larger levy – 4.8 mills – was renewed
by the voters of Cuyahoga County in
March 2012 and is es mated to generate
$127.4 million and $127.0 million in
2014 and 2015, respec vely. Revenue
derived from the recently renewed
smaller levy – 3.9 mills – is es mated
at $103.2 million and $103.1 million in
2014 and 2015, respec vely. This levy
was passed on the ballot in November 2013. Levy revenue is considered
to be part of the County’s General Fund and is allocated at the discre on
of County Council, on the recommenda on of the County Execu ve.
The levies supplement other funding –
specifically from the Federal and State
governments for mandated services
such as the protec on of children and
the elderly from abuse and neglect,
eligibility determina on and enrollment in
en tlement programs, such as Medicaid
and the Supplemental Nutri on Assistance

such as the County hospital (MetroHealth), early care and educa on
(birth to age 5), services to successfully integrate ex-oﬀenders into the
community, and in-home care for seniors, enabling them to remain in
their homes and avoid unnecessary – and costly – nursing home stays.
In 2014, All Funds spending in the areas of Social Services, Health and
Safety totals $582.4 million; the levies represent just 40.4% of the

Fines and Forfeitures – Revenue generated from various fines and forfeitures, mostly notably court costs, is es mated to total $12.8 million
in year 2014 and 2015 and represents 1.0% of total All Funds revenue.
The largest contributor to this revenue category is the Court of Common
Pleas: fines collected represent nearly 70% of total fines. The es mate
in the biennial budget assumed a con nued trend of an increase in court
costs of 3% each year. This may be conserva ve as the Fiscal Oﬃce and
the Clerk of Courts are aggressively working to increase the collec on
rate among other things, accep ng credit card payments, partnering
with the Ohio A orney General’s Oﬃce to pursue outstanding debts and
by increasing the deposits on civil cases.

Miscellaneous – Other revenue to the County that cannot be classified
in the other categories is recorded as miscellaneous revenue. Combined, these sources represent 6.3% of total All Funds revenue and 1.3%
of General Opera ng Fund revenue. In general, miscellaneous revenue
is not consistent. The 2014 budget of $82.1 million, for example, is 29%
less than 2013 actual of $116.4 million. Increases in 2013 are oﬀset by
one- me ac vity that took place in 2013 only, es mated revenues in
2014 include but a not limited to:
 Sewer Fees (Sanitary Engineer) - $34 million
 Proceeds from loans - $15 million
The budget is based on trend iden fied over the previous years (approximately $4.6 million in the General Opera ng Fund), as well as known
revenue that will come to the County over the next three years.

Fund Budgets
Introduc on
Cuyahoga County receives revenues for the services it provides from a
variety of sources. These revenues are segregated into Funds: formal
en es that account for all receipts and expenditures. This sec on of
the 2014-2015 Budget Plan addresses the various fund groups, revenue
and expenditure trends, and ending balances within these accoun ng
en es. The report provides graphs and schedules to accompany the
narra ves and help to demonstrate the interplay between the funds.
Cuyahoga County’s revenue is recorded in a number of separate funds
and corresponding subsidiary funds, each defined by either its source
of funding or the condi ons that govern its use. The fund balances
are usually viewed as the leading indicator of the financial health and
stability of County government. The sec ons that follow will discuss
the financial status of the various funds by fund type and focus on the
impact of budget ac vity on fund balances, both presently and in the
future. Fund types used by the County are done so in accordance with
governmental accoun ng standards and are defined in the Financial
Structure and Repor ng Rela onships sec on of the Budget Guide.
Major fund types used include General, Special Revenue, Debt Service,
2014CountyExpendituresbyFundType

Enterprise, and Internal Service. Each of the funds is discussed in detail
in this sec on.
The following defini ons may be helpful when referring to the financial
schedules presented in this sec on:
 Ending Balances are defined as the diﬀerence between total resources
(beginning balance plus opera ng revenues), and total expenditures. The
ending balances reflect the actual cash balance available at the end of the
year.
 Actuals capture documented expenditures and revenues during the
specified year
 Available Ending Balance is the unobligated balance of a fund. The Available Ending Balance is calculated as follows: Total Available Resources Total Opera ng Expenditures - Adjustments to Balance = Available Ending
Balance
 Adjustments to Balance are reserves on the cash balance not reflected
in current expenses that need to be subtracted calcula ng the Available
Ending Balance (see figure XX).

The All Funds Analysis examines the combined ac vity of all fund types
budgeted and appropriated by the County Council. The $1.31 billion
expenditure level authorized for both 2014 and 2015 a captures the
broad range of governmental ac vity under the budgetary authority of
the County Execu ve. On an All Funds level in 2014, the provision of
social services and jus ce and public safety are the primary func ons of
County government. The social services expenditures make up 38% of
all budgeted expenditures and jus ce and public safety programs 23%
of all County funds. General government services add another 12% of
the expenditures, followed by health and wellness, public safety, debt
service, and public works (please see figure XX).

Revenue&Expenditure

Transfers between funds are authorized by the County Council and
are budgeted as appropriated expenditures. Examples of common
inter-fund transfers are subsidy payments and internal service charges.
Subsidies generally reflect transfers of General Fund dollars (including
the Health and Human Services Levy funds) to support ac vity in other
funds. On the financial schedules, subsidy payments are reflected as
Other Financing Uses on the expense side (in the total General Fund)
and Other Financing Sources on the revenue side (in the special revenue
fund that receives the subsidy). Internal Service Funds receive cash
transfers as reimbursements for services rendered, the transfers post as
opera ng expenditures and revenues in the aﬀected subfunds.

All Funds Overview
Based on Figure FB-1, the 2014 All Funds revenue of $1.29 billion
represents a slight increase from the revenues collected in 2013.
Increases in property taxes and sales taxes reflect a con nued
incremental upswing in economic ac vity in the region and gives reason
for restrained op mism. Major factors in the trend include: the
increase of $40.0 million in health and human services levy tax revenue
that resulted from the passage of the higher 3.9 mill levy; the higher
es mated bond proceeds of $15.0 million for the Western Reserve Fund;
and the increase in Public Assistance revenues for the Department of
Children and Family Services.

The General Fund is the primary opera ng fund of the County. This
fund grouping comprises two separate funds: General Opera ng and
Health and Human Services Levy Fund. Resources of the General Fund
cover a wide range of services both under the authority of the County
Execu ve and those provided by other elected oﬃcials, boards, and
commissions. The General Fund is the only discre onary fund included
in the County’s All Funds budget. In addi on to suppor ng the County’s
various mandates, the General Fund is used to finance non-mandated
programs and services that the County Execu ve determines are
needed in order to achieve the overall vision for the County. This vision
includes a strong Countywide economy, healthy ci zens, protec on of
vulnerable popula ons (i.e. abused or neglected children and adults),
and excellent stewardship of County assets. The overwhelming majority
(over 65%) of expenses in the General Fund are for mandated programs
and services, such as adjudica on, law enforcement, and certain human
services.
The condi on of the General Fund is a primary indicator of the County’s
overall financial health. Therefore, the County has structured its
financial policies, which are outlined in the Budget Guide sec on of this
document, to preserve the health of the General Fund. The General
Fund Opera ng reserve policy has been codified in Title Seven of the
Cuyahoga County Code. Maintaining a healthy reserve is vital to ensure

is $175.5 million and $167.4 million
in 2015, which represents 28.7%
and 27.1% of an cipated expenditures over the biennium. General

General Fund - Opera ng Budget
The General Fund supports a number of diﬀerent agencies under the
authority of the County Execu ve (e.g., Public Safety, Development,
Fiscal Oﬃce, Sheriﬀ, Public Works) as well as all of the other elected
oﬃcials (e.g. the County Council, Courts, Prosecutor). Though there is
some flexibility in the use of these dollars, the County Execu ve and
County Council must place priority on mandated programs and services
when alloca ng General Fund resources among the various program
budgets of elected oﬃcials and departments.

The HHS Levy Fund supports a myriad of programs and services that seek
to ensure the physical, mental, and emo onal health of the County. The
County’s social service agencies use three types of funding to con nue
its opera ons: Federal and State alloca ons, reimbursements, and
the health and human services levies passed by the voters. For 2014,
agencies with levy subsidies include, but are not limited to the following:

$20,000,000 $40,000,000 $60,000,000 $80,000,000 $100,000,000

C:\Users\mjones\AppData\Local\Temp\XPgrpwise\GFopersfinbydept_1.xls/GFopersfinbydept_1.xls/GFopersfinbydeptchart

There is a strong correla on between General Fund revenue and the
health of the regional and State economies. Unemployment has seen
a steady increase since early 2012 and the per capita income growth
for the region lags that of the United States. As homeowners struggle
to pay mortgages or abandon proper es, property tax delinquencies
increase, directly aﬀec ng tax collec ons. The vola lity of General Fund
revenue is the primary jus fica on for the County Council’s establishing
the 25% reserve. Should revenue quickly or sharply decline, the balance
is needed to ensure con nuity of services while a deficit reduc on plan
can be developed and implemented.

The 2014 levy revenue of $230.6 million is $25.2 million higher than the
2013 actual of $205.3 million. The passage of the 3.9 mil levy yielded
an extra 26.7 million for social programs while the 4.8 levy revenues are
es mated to decrease by $1.9 million. The five-year 3.9 mil levy would
poten ally increase program funding by 35% from the former 2.9 mil
levy if economic factors were to stay the same. The increase in levy
revenues has been reflected in the higher departmental expenditure
budgets for 2014 and 2015.

The 2014 HHS Levy budget an cipates
an ending balance of approximately
$34.6 million and of $28.8 million
in 2015. This represents 14.7% and
12.2%, respec vely, of the annual
appropria on level. This level is below
the Government Finance Oﬃcers
Associa on (GFOA) best prac ce
recommenda on of 20-25% but follows the County’s new codified policy
(see Health and Human Services Fund Balance Reserve Policy).

Special Revenue Funds

The County’s financial policies indicate that expenditures in the Special
Revenue Funds should not exceed the funds’ available resources, though
the General Fund subsidizes many of the Special Revenue Funds. Schedule
III includes a lis ng of the General Fund subsidies to various Special Revenue
Funds. Subsidies are provided when a match of county dollars is required
in order to draw down the revenue or when the County Council determines
that addi onal funding is needed to provide eﬀec ve programs and services.
The above referenced policy statement and others are incorporated in the
“Financial and Budgetary Policies” por on of the Budget Guide sec on.
The 2014 budget for the Special Revenue Funds totals $651.8 million. This
represents an increase of $35.8 million from the 2013 actual of $616.0
million. Es mated revenue totals $644.1 million, including approximately
$165.1 million (or 25.6% of total revenue) in General Fund/HHS levy
subsidies. The es mated Ending Cash Balance of $194.4 million is calculated
by the diﬀerence between current revenue and expenses plus the beginning
balance of $302.1 million. Please see Figure FB-6 for a historical analysis of
combined revenue and expenses.
The following narra ve describes some of the special revenue funds included in the 2014-2015 budget:

Special Revenue Funds
Special Revenue Funds are established and maintained to account for
resources designated for specific purposes. The “Special Revenue Funds”
category includes grants, state and Federal alloca ons, and tax collec ons
suppor ng a designated ac vity. The County’s financial policies dictate that
expenditures from these funds are limited to the mandates or direc on of
the funding source, and cannot be used to subsidize other funds, except
as required or permi ed by program regula ons or legal direc ve. Each
Special Revenue Fund is designated by a subfund in the County’s accoun ng
system that carries its own name, number, separate accoun ng entries, and
relevant financial reports.

capability such that they can live, learn, work, and play in the community and to assist and support their families in achieving this objec ve.
The Board is supported in part by a 3.9 mil property tax levy. This levy,
last approved in November 2005, is con nuous, which means that unlike the two HHS levies it does not need to be reapproved by the voters
every four years. The Board receives the same amount of voted support
unless the public approves a change. The Board receives no support
from the General Fund or the Health and Human Services Levy Funds.

The 2014 budget an cipates $88.8 million in levy property tax collecons and another $88.4 million in Intergovernmental revenue, including
Medicaid reimbursements and the Ohio Department of Educa on alloca ons. Property tax and intergovernmental revenue remain rela vely
flat from 2013 levels. The total budgeted revenue of $186.0 million in
2014 is approximately $16.3 million less than, or 8.1% lower than, the
approved opera ng budget of $202.3 million (Please see Figure FB-7).
The Es mated 2014 Ending Cash Balance of $102.0 million represents
50.4% of the annual appropria on level, well above the best prac ce
recommenda ons for fund balances. While the ending balance remains
healthy over the biennium, the cash balance has dropped 28.6% from
the 2012 level of $130.6 million to $93.2 million in 2015 as a result of
reduced State reimbursements.

Theore cally, the PA funds should have a zero balance at the end of the
year; expenditures should equal the sum of total available resources,
including HHS Levy Fund subsidies. In reality, however, these subfunds
rarely end the year with a zero balance due to the two methods of funding (reimbursement and advance) the State uses. Addi onally, there is
an annual reconcilia on process completed a er the first quarter of the

Children’s Services Fund
This fund, included in the HHS division of Children and Family Services’ (DCFS) budget, maintains the revenue and expenses – budgeted at
$68.1 million in 2014 - associated with the board and care of children in
paid placements (foster/adop ve and residen al treatment). The largest revenue source in 2014 and 2015 is the $44.5 million (or 65.3% of
total revenue) subsidy provided by the HHS Levy Fund, which is $4.6
million higher than the 2013 level of $39.9 million. The higher subsidy
level is available through the passage of the 3.9 mil HHS levy. The largest
non-local funding is from Social Security Act Title IV-E revenues ($14.4
million, or 62.7% of intergovernmental revenues) and the State Child
Welfare Alloca on ($6.2 million, or 26.4%). Title IV-E revenue, which
reimburses the County for out-of-home board and care expenses, has
been declining due to reduc ons in the number of children in placements.

When alloca ons are reduced, the County must decide whether to cut

to the agency to maintain exis ng service levels. The HHS Levy Fund
provides more than $88.9 million in subsidies to the PA Funds in 2014
and $91.1 million in 2015. This demonstrates that the level of need for

training – for dislocated workers and corporate employees - and job
placement. Workforce Development also operates from 11 “One Stop”

Funding for Workforce Development, the major source of which is an

while the expense budget is $11.7 million and $10.2 million for each

categorical grants, are used to finance specific, me-limited projects
and are not included in the All Funds opera ng budget. General Fund

Categorical Grants
Housing and Urban Development Grants
The County receives revenue from the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) that is allocated to the Department of
Development and the Oﬃce of Homeless Services (under the Oﬃce for
Health and Human Services). HUD funding includes the Community
Development Block Grants (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership
funding, and the Emergency Solu ons Grants (ESG).
CDBG grants are large Federal alloca ons granted to the County, which
has discre onary authority over the distribu on of funds to fulfill the
broad objec ves of the CDBG program. The County Council’s policy
dictates that the CDBG Fund will operate within Federal guidelines
and available funding. CDBG funding supports aﬀordable housing
programs and job crea on through the expansion and reten on of
businesses. Housing ac vi es include, but are not limited to, roof and
furnace rehabilita on and replacement, grants and loans for safety and
energy eﬃciency, housing for low-to-moderate income households, fair
housing, lead abatement, nuisance abatement (demoli on), and senior
safety rehabilita on. Economic and community development ac vi es
include grants to municipali es and planning.
The HOME program provides formula grants for aﬀordable housing
opportuni es in the County. Ac vi es include down payment
assistance, security deposits, and subsidies for sale or rental projects
in four en tlement communi es: Cleveland Heights, Euclid, Lakewood,
and Parma.
The Emergency Solu ons (formerly Emergency Shelter) Grants provide
support for shelter and essen al suppor ve services for homeless
individuals.

V-24

The 2014 budget an cipates approximately $5.4 in new HUD grant
funding for the Departments of Development and Homeless Services,
an increase from 2013’s award of $4.9 million. Over the last few years
HUD funding, and specifically the ESG grant for emergency housing, has
been a casualty in the Federal budget reduc ons. Last year’s ESG award
was 10% lower than the 2012 award and this year’s level is unchanged
from last year’s. In addi on to the decrease for ESG, the County will no
longer administer the Home Weatheriza on Assistance Program (HWAP)
for the City of Cleveland a er June 30, 2014 and the funding to benefit
other ci es going forward is uncertain; HWAP is the U.S. Department
of Energy’s hea ng assistance program through the Ohio Development
Services Agency. These funding changes will require ongoing review
to determine the eﬀects on the Departments of Development and
Homeless Services. Federal HUD Grants are not considered opera ng
funds and are not a part of the formal budget process, but provide a
significant funding stream to the region.
Capital Improvement Plan
The construc on, maintenance and repair of roads and bridges,
wastewater treatment facili es and lines, and public buildings and
investment in informa on technology are important for the provision
of eﬀec ve and eﬃcient services. To assure that this infrastructure is
well maintained, the County prepares a five year capital plan for each
major infrastructure area. The capital improvement budget involves
planning for the long term maintenance of capital assets and inves ng
in equipment and technology. Please refer to the capital plan sec on of
this document for a discussion of the capital projects.

Debt Service Fund
The Debt Service Fund is used to budget payments of principal and
interest on all notes and bonds issued by the County (see Figure FB 11).
Property Tax revenues for debt service are derived from voted and unvoted property taxes. Other Intergovernmental Revenues reflect State
reimbursements for property tax collec ons and commercial ac vity tax
reimbursement. These factors are described in the Revenue Analysis
Sec on under Tax Reduc on Factors. In addi on to the reimbursements,
intergovernmental revenues are derived from special assessments and
tax-increment financing revenue. Other Financing Sources (i.e., General
Fund subsidies) for 2014 include budgeted payments for the following
programs:

The 2014 total revenue is $73.3 million, which represents a 11.0%
increase from the 2013 actual of $77.0 million. The General Fund subsidy
is es mated to increase by $2.2 million (or 5.6% over the 2013 actual
of $38.8 million). This overall increase is for addi onal debt service
from the an cipated issue of economic development debt in 2014. The
opera ng revenue of $32.3 million is less than the budgeted expenses of
$77.6 million, but the available beginning cash balance of $18.6 million
is to cover 2014 debt service payments. The es mated available ending
balance for 2014 is $14.3 million and for 2015 is $12.4 million in 2015
(Please see Figure FB-10).

Enterprise Funds
Enterprise Funds are established to finance and account for the
acquisi on, opera on, and maintenance of county facili es and services
that are supported by user charges. These funds operate in a manner
similar to the private sector in that they are financed primarily by charges
to consumers, established with the approval of the County Council.
Their accoun ng must indicate whether they operate at a profit or a
loss. Although all county owned enterprises are subject to the laws and
regula ons like other County programs, certain types of enterprises
are frequently subject to regula ons set by agencies at higher levels of
government that aﬀect their basic opera ons, financing, and accoun ng.
The County Airport at Robert D. Shea Field, for example, is subject to
regula on by the Federal Avia on Administra on (FAA). There are four
enterprise funds under the authority of the County Execu ve:

Fund Budgets
Enterprise Funds
When user charges are not suﬃcient to cover opera ng expenses, the
General Fund may subsidize the shor all. Please refer to Figure FB 12
for subsidized enterprise funds. The County’s financial policies s pulate
that enterprises should generate revenue equal to at least 50% of their
total opera ons and work toward becoming fully self-suppor ng. The
service charges for these funds, as well as the costs of opera on, should
be reviewed on an annual basis to minimize the need for General Fund
support.

The Parking Garage Fund records the ac vity of the County-owned
garages and parking lots. Fund opera ons ended 2013 with a cash
balance of 39.4% as total revenue con nued to exceed the expense
levels. The Public Works Department has included in its capital plan
structural repairs and improvements to the garages that will draw down
some of this cash reserve over the next five years. The 2014 - 2015
budget an cipates $3.8 million in revenue on average with projected
expenses of $3.1 million each year.

Neither the County Airport nor REDSS’ revenue is suﬃcient to cover its
opera ng expenses in 2014, so General Fund subsidies are es mated
at $90,704 and $594,721 for the respec ve programs. The subsidy
for REDSS has dwindled over the past few years and is expected to be
eliminated as of 2015 due to an increase in user fee revenues. The
Airport’s subsidy has also decreased as expenditures have dropped;
in 2013 the revenues grew as a percentage of expenses to 79% from
the previous year’s 50%. The Airport Division was moved from the
Department of Development to Public Works (O2012-0035) and the
Department contracted for a review of opera ons. The results of the
review will shape the organiza on and management of the Airport going
forward, so the spending and revenue pa erns will need to be reviewed
over the course of the biennium.

Combined revenue for the Enterprise Funds in 2014 totals $41.6 million
and expenditures are budgeted at $38.9 million. The Sanitary Engineer’s
revenues are higher than expenses by $2.0 million; this cushion allows
for emergency repairs and for capital planning that will directly benefit
the sewer districts. Capital outlays include repair and replacement
of broken or damaged lines, pump sta on maintenance, wastewater
treatment facility renova ons or expansions, construc on of new
infrastructure, and equipment purchases. For all Enterprise Funds the
2014 es mated Ending Cash Balance is $38.7 million, of which $34.5 is
in the Sanitary Engineer fund.

Eight Internal Service Funds are under the authority of the County
Execu ve. These funds along with their major revenue sources are listed
below (please see the Program Budget Sec on for a specific descrip on
of these funds):
 Centralized Custodial Services: space maintenance, including custodial,
trades, and architectural
 Sheriﬀ Building Security Services: security for various county facili es
 Communica ons: mail delivery and postage
 Fast Copier: copier and prin ng services
 County Garage: purchase and maintenance of county fleet vehicles
 Supplies: purchase of oﬃce and computer supplies
 Workers’ Compensa on Retrospec ve Program: workers’ compensa on
costs and safety training
 Hospitaliza on – Self-Funded Insurance Program: countywide
hospitaliza on claims and dental and vision plan premiums

The County’s financial policies state that charges and rate schedules
shall be suﬃcient to cover the opera ons of the fund. The General Fund
has subsidized select Internal Service Funds when the costs were not
recoverable due to the passage of me, with minimal contribu ons in
2011 none budgeted in 2014 or 2015. Internal Service Funds generate
revenue from charges for services from user agencies. These charges
may change during the course of the year based on services rendered
and periodic reconcilia ons. The County’s financial policies dictate that
internal service charge revenues are monitored closely to ensure that
actual expenditures are recovered.

Internal Service Funds
Internal Service Funds capture services provided by one County agency to
other County agencies on a reimbursement basis. Revenue is generated
through user fees charged to the recipient agency to cover these costs.

Fund Budgets
Internal Service Funds
The 2014 approved budget for the Internal Service funds of $131.3 million
represents a decrease of $8.5 million from $139.8 million in 2013 and a
decrease of $32.3 million from the 2012 level. In 2013 the Department of
Informa on Technology’s (IT) data processing services were reclassified
from an internal services fund to General Fund. This resulted in a transfer
of $21.2 million of expenses in 2013 to the General Fund; the IT General
Fund expenses are allocated via an indirect cost plan that includes
charges to the other funds for IT services. The largest diﬀerence between
2013 expenditures and 2014 budget for this fund group is a decrease
of $4.4 million for Public Works’ Facili es Maintenance Division. That

V-32

budget was reduced in an cipa on of lower space maintenance needs
from the move of 750 employees into one administra on building in
summer 2014. The es mated 2014 Available Ending Balance of $32.7
million represents 24.9% of total expenses. These substan al balances
are a ributable to both the Workers’ Compensa on and Hospitaliza on
funds. The large balances are recommended due to the County’s selfinsured status, which means catastrophic losses would be paid directly
from the cash balance.
The Hospitaliza on Self-Insurance account’s expenditure decrease from
$75.8 million in 2013 to $74.9 million in 2014 reflects a con nued savings
from the shi to low-cost health plans for bargaining and non-bargaining
employees. The migra on of 1,000 employees to the Metrohealth plan
has resulted in significant savings as this plan has less expensive rates for
the County than the other plans.

Funding is generated from a fee applied to moneys collected on any tax duplicate
other than estate taxes. Prior to 2011, the Board of Revision received funding from
the General Fund.

The Board of Revision is charged with the primary responsibility to resolve
real property valuaƟon complaints Įled by property owners and school
boards. The Board of Revision is also required to hear complaints regarding
homestead exempƟon denials, remission of penalty, manufactured home
valuaƟon complaints, and House Bill 294 (the Board's hearing and
adjudicaƟon of tax foreclosures).
In addiƟon to the required noƟces by cerƟĮed mail to all statutory parƟes
that a complaint was Įled on their property or with the school board when a
complaint Įled meets the threshold of a $50,000 of value change sought, the
Board of Revision must generate cerƟĮed noƟces of the hearing date and
decision noƟces.
Complainants may appeal their decision with the Board of Tax Appeals or
Common Pleas Court, where upon Įling an appeal the Board of Revision is
required to prepare a transcript of the case within 45 days as required by
Ohio Revised Code.
The County Prosecutor's oĸce represents the Board of Revision as its client
on all appeals Įled. The Board of Revision employs several Įeld analysts to
assist the Prosecutor's Oĸce by conducƟng Įeld reviews and narraƟves of
appealed properƟes.

The Records and Licenses division receives funding from the General Fund. The
MicroĮlming Center has created revenueͲgeneraƟng agreements with other
government agencies.

The OperaƟons division keeps a record system as a means whereby the
parƟes involved in property transacƟons are assured their interests are
maintained. OperaƟons also oīers cerƟĮed copies of any record Įled for

returned for use on the local level.
The County Fiscal Oĸcer acts as an agent for the Ohio Tax Commissioner and
is responsible for processing the Estate tax returns of decedents who resided
in Cuyahoga County and died before January 1, 2013. The State budget for
2012Ͳ2013 (Am. Sub. H.B. 153) repealed the estate tax aŌer this date.
Statutory obligaƟon mandates the audiƟng of 100,000 Homestead ExempƟon
recipients and 3,500 new applicaƟons on an annual basis. A meƟculous
examinaƟon of comprehensive supporƟve documentaƟon is required to
determine eligibility resulƟng in a saving to individual homeowners.

The revenue source for this fund is interest earned on early tax payments

through automaƟc debits and coupon payments.

Funds for the Tax Prepayment Special Interest program were derived from interest
earned on tax prepayments per O.R.C. Chapter 321.45.

Currently, each automaƟc debit parƟcipant is credited with a porƟon of the
interest earned on their prepayments in the form of a discount on the
following year's taxes. Increased parƟcipaƟon in the automaƟc debit
program will result in addiƟonal tax discounts.

ProgramDescripƟon

ProgramFundingSummary

The County Treasurer is authorized to sell delinquent tax liens in the form of
tax cerƟĮcates.

The source of funding for the Tax CerƟĮcate AdministraƟon program was fees from
the administraƟon of tax cerƟĮcates per O.R.C. Chapter 5721.31.

The purchaser of the tax lien buys the tax cerƟĮcates for the amount of
delinquent taxes, assessments, penalƟes, and interest, plus a premium or
minus a discount, and all fees associated with the cost of the sale. The
purchaser assumes the superior lien of the State of Ohio and its taxing
districts for those taxes, assessments, penalƟes, and interests collecƟng at
rate of up to 18%. The tax cerƟĮcate purchaser may insƟtute foreclosure
proceedings against the property one year aŌer the cerƟĮcate is issued.
Beginning in 2012, Įnancial acƟvity for this program moved to budget
account FS109736.

ProgramFundingSummary
The Oĸce of Procurement and Diversity receives its funding from the General

The Cuyahoga County Oĸce of Procurement and Diversity (OPD) is
responsible for the procurement of equipment, materials, supplies,
construcƟon and services for all of the County departments, agencies, and
elected oĸcials in a manner which is cost eīecƟve and in compliance with
the laws of the State of Ohio and the policies and ordinances of Cuyahoga
County. OPD implements formal and informal bidding procedures for items
covered by compeƟƟve bidding policies, ordinances, and laws.
In addiƟon to compeƟƟve bidding, other types of procurement are
processed, such as sole source and emergency purchases. Records of
purchases, bids, vendor lisƟngs and sales of surplus property are maintained
by the division pursuant to Council Ord. 2011Ͳ0014. The Oĸce of
Procurement and Diversity also has the responsibility of monitoring
purchases to ensure compliance with County policies, administering the
Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Program, and processing acƟon items for
approval by the various County contracƟng authoriƟes.
The Oĸce of Procurement and Diversity became a part of the Fiscal Oĸce in
2011. The Įnancial acƟvity was formerly recorded under a county
administraƟon account. Since this operaƟon moved from the direct
leadership of the county commissioners to the Įscal oĸce, the program type
also changed from SupporƟve Services to Fiscal Management.

DescripƟon

ObjecƟves

SupporƟve Services represent internal acƟviƟes necessary for ongoing
operaƟon of the County's direct service funcƟons. The Department of
Public Works' faciliƟes management division provides the custodial, skilled
trades, security staī who maintain County faciliƟes.

To establish consistent standards in the provision of support services to
all county agencies.

The Oĸce of Procurement and Diversity coordinates the purchase of goods
and services for County agencies, while countywide insurance and property
management funcƟons are handled by the Risk and Property Management
and Building Management Divisions. The Department of InformaƟon
Technology provides a centralized data processing and telecommunicaƟons
management system for the County and charges those expenses to
nonͲGeneral Fund accounts. Four internal service funds operate on a
selfͲsustaining basis to provide support services: CommunicaƟons (mail
service), Fast Copier, Maintenance Garage (vehicle maintenance), and
County Supplies. Prior to 2013, data processing and telecommunicaƟons
management were provideded through the InformaƟon Services Center
through an internal service fund.

To review internal service fund charges annually and set rates to fully
recover expenditures.

AdultOīenderManagement

DescripƟon

ObjecƟves

Adult Oīender Management is accomplished by the detenƟon of prisoners
at the County's maximum security jail, where inmates are provided with
medical, psychiatric, and educaƟonal services. When the populaƟon in the
jail becomes too high or condiƟons are unsafe, prisoners are transferred to
the various fullͲservice jails in Cuyahoga County and the housing
municipaliƟes are paid at the rate of $55 per day (reŇected in the Prisoner
Board and Care budget).

To conƟnue the collaboraƟon among the jusƟce system partners,
including the Court of Common Pleas, the Sheriī's Oĸce, the
Prosecutor's Oĸce, the Public Defender, the municipal courts, the
Cleveland Police Department, and others and maintain the momentum
of the County's JusƟce Reform IniƟaƟve
To respond to an increase in the number of prisoners engaged in
communityͲbased correcƟons as a result of a change in sentencing laws
following the passage of House Bill 86

Board and care expenses outside of the County Jail have decreased
dramaƟcally over the past few years as a result of the County's JusƟce
Reform IniƟaƟve, which includes Early Case Management and DisposiƟon
for lowͲlevel felony cases. This process has dramaƟcally reduced the
average length of Ɵme between arrest and disposiƟon, thereby saving
money via fewer jail days. Also contribuƟng to the decrease in expenses
was the Sheriī's standardizaƟon of the per diem paid to the housing
municipaliƟes: the new rate was lower than what was previously paid Ͳ in
some cases signiĮcantly Ͳ to all but one jail.

Funds are uƟlized to provide supplemental services to juveniles, such as
incenƟves for program parƟcipaƟon (e.g. bus Ɵckets).

Funding for Treatment Services Medicaid was derived from Medicaid
reimbursements of eligble services to adolescent clients.

In late 2009 and into 2010 these services were dramaƟcally reduced as the
Division of Treatment Services no longer serves youth released from the
Youth Development Center (YDC) since the closure on December 31, 2008.
Without the eligible clients the revenues for this fund were dramaƟcally
reduced. The residual equity in the fund was transferred to the HHS division

ProgramFundingSummary

The Geographic InformaƟon Systems (GIS) Division provides geospaƟal
infrastructure, analysis, and support services to Cuyahoga County agencies,
governmental enƟƟes, and the public. The division maintains the Cuyahoga
Enterprise GIS infrastructure environment, develops and maintains
applicaƟons, coordinates data and map creaƟon, conducts data analysis, and
promotes regional collaboraƟon.

The majority of funding is provided through the Real Estate Assessment fund which
comes from fees on real property taxes. Other funds may come from charges to
agencies for data processing services.

The GIS became part of the InformaƟon Services Center in 2010. Prior to
2013, this program was classiĮed as an internal service fund program
(IS694588), but a reevaluaƟon of users resulted in a transfer to a regular
special revenue fund.

comprehensive planning, quaility of life, environment, and economic
development of Cuyahoga County and its ciƟes, villages and townships, and
has a renewed forcus that more closesly aligns its overall goals of revitalizing

ProgramFundingSummary

The Cuyahoga Valley IniƟaƟve (CVI) was a community-wide eīort to restore
the economic, social, and environmental health of the Cuyahoga Valley but is
no longer part of the Planning Commission's priority work program. The
project has been inacƟve since mid 2012.

Funding for the Cuyahoga Valley IniƟaƟve came primarily from a General Fund

The District is funded through local charges for polluƟon prevenƟon services,
watershed planning and service fees, State grants for watershed planning, private
grants, a County General Fund subsidy, and a State match of local funds.

The Cuyahoga SWCD board and staī have idenƟĮed Įve main prioriƟes for
the organizaƟon:
1.) advocate for and provide urban soil and water conservaƟon services and
programs;
2.) achieve U.S. Clean Water Act Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) targets
for impaired local watersheds, as well as providing signiĮcant assistance in
meeƟng the naƟonal targets;
3.) establish and maintain strategic alliances to advance soil and water
conservaƟon; and
4.) expand the organizaƟonal capacity of Cuyahoga SWCD.

The Oĸce of Health and Human Services is funded by the County's Public
Assistance allocaƟons, Title IVͲD, and the County's two Health and Human Services

Children and Family Services, Senior and Adult Services, and the Family and
Children First Council. The Oĸce generates reimbursement from Title IVͲD for its

MulƟsystemic Therapy (MST) Unit
MulƟsystemic Therapy (MST) is an evidence-based, intensive home and
community-based treatment model. The target populaƟon of the MST
Program is youth ages 12-17 who are at risk of out-of-home placement due
to acƟng out behaviors. The average treatment involves about 60 hours of
contact during a 4-6 month period. Therapists have small caseloads of four
to six families; are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; and provide
services at Ɵmes convenient to the family.
MST therapists concentrate on empowering parents and improving their
eīecƟveness by idenƟfying strengths, developing collaboraƟve working
relaƟonships with school, neighbors, peers' parents, etc., developing natural
support systems and removing barriers. Treatment techniques used to
facilitate these gains include cogniƟve behavioral, behavioral, and the
pragmaƟc family therapies.
Through these systemic intervenƟons, the MST Unit intends to create
long-term change in the youth's behavior, and the family's ability to manage
the youth's behavior within the home, thereby reducing the risks that may
result in an out of home placement.
The funding for this unit and all divisions under the children and family
services fund/subfund (24A/301) are provided by intergovernmental revenue
sources, miscellaneous sources and the health and human services levy.

ProgramFundingSummary

The Cuyahoga Tapestry System of Care (CTSOC) partnership of public, private,
and neighborhood agencies provides coordinated care for families with
children and/or teens that have complicated emoƟonal needs. The
partnership is focused upon empowering families and helping them sustain
their health and wellness for their beneĮt and the beneĮt of our community.

Prior to 2012, The Cuyahoga Tapestry System of Care (CTSOC) was a seperate

reorganizaƟon of HHS, CTSOC has been merged into the HHS division of Children
and Family Services (CFS). The agency is now a division of HHS CFS, the program
informaƟon can now be found within the CFS division.

In 2012, CTSOC was merged into the HHS division of Children and Family
Services (CFS). Therefore this index code is no longer in use.

The Cuyahoga County Fatherhood IniƟaƟve seeks to strengthen families by
encouraging fathers to play a more acƟve role in nurturing and raising their

The Fatherhood IniƟaƟve was transferred as a program of the Cuyahoga Support
Enforcement Agency (CSEA) from the Oĸce for Health and Human Services
eīecƟve January 2012. The IniƟaƟve's expenses, including personnel and contracts
for services, are exclusively supported by the County's two Health and Human

ProgramFundingSummary

Prior to 2011, this division contained expenditures for the federally funded
programs under the Child Care Development Block Grant and the Child Care
Development Fund.

Local funding for this program was completely eliminated because the Ohio Dept of
Jobs and Family Services has taken administraƟve responsibility for the
reimbursement of subsidized childcare.

This State administered program reimburses the County for subsidized
Child-Care Services provided to eligible families.
The State of Ohio took over administraƟon of Child Care Services in 2010.
The remaining balance in the fund, aŌer all corresponding expenditures had
posted, was transferred in 2013 to the Work & Training AdministraƟon fund.

Funding to operate the Special Waste Convenience Center comes from the District's
GeneraƟon Fee, which is a fee of $1.50 levied on each ton of solid waste that is
produced within Cuyahoga County by residenƟal, commercial, and industrial waste
generators. The fee is collected by landĮlls and transfer staƟons that receive
Cuyahoga County waste. No fee is levied on materials that are recycled or
composted. AddiƟonal funding to support this program comes from a grant
provided by the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District which amounts to up to
$250,000 annually or unƟl the $1.0 million in grant funds are spent.

ProgramDescripƟon

ProgramFundingSummary
Revenues are generated from charges for coͲpayments to the employees and the
County.

This account tracks the Įnancial acƟvity for the employee health beneĮt
plans paid from the County's selfͲinsured fund. The plans include medical
insurance and a prescripƟon drug beneĮt plan.
The County's large cash balance allows for parƟcipaƟon in selfͲinsured plans
because the County has the backing of its bank account to cover catastrophic
losses. Self insurance is less expensive than tradiƟonal plans with
commercial insurers because the perͲemployee premium paid to the insurer
is bypassed; the County directly pays for health care claims expenses to
providers.

This budget is supported by the General Fund.

A variety of obligaƟons and commitments are included in this budget,
including memberships, subscripƟons, and fees. Some of these expenses are
payments to the Animal ProtecƟve League, NaƟonal AssociaƟon of CounƟes
and the Government Finance Oĸcers AssociaƟon.
Also included are reimbursements to the City of Cleveland for their porƟon of
the State Public Defender's 40% reimbursement to the County for expenses
relaƟng to indigent defense. These State Defender reimbursements go
through the County because the County's Public Defender staīs a division
dedicated to Cleveland Municipal Court so the expenses are incurred by the
County.
AddiƟonally, an annual $250,000 debt service payment is paid out of this
budget to the State of Ohio for repayment of a loan that was used to cover
certain Gateway Project construcƟon costs overruns. This debt service
payment terms out in 2017.

Capital Plan
IntroducƟon
Up to this point the Budget Plan has focused on County services for the 20142015 fiscal period. While opera ng costs are apparent, Cuyahoga County
spends significant resources on infrastructure to support these services. The
capital improvements plan encompasses the maintenance and repair of five
broad project groups; roads and bridges, wastewater treatment facili es and
lines, County owned buildings, informa on technology and equipment, and
the County Airport. The five year Capital Improvements Plan (CIP) provides
the funding priori es across these investment categories. To assure that this
infrastructure is well maintained, the County prepares a five year capital plan
for each major infrastructure area.
The capital improvement budget involves planning for the long term maintenance of capital assets. The County’s major capital assets are expensive, have
a significant useful life, and o en require more than one year to construct. The
County must allocate limited resources among many areas, and it is through
this planning eﬀort that all capital assets can be adequately maintained.
The Capital Improvements Plan for 2014-2018 totals $824.7 million over the
five year plan horizon. This total includes the construc on of a hotel cos ng
$266 million. As project plans and funding are finalized project work or investments are ini ated. Unlike the opera ng budget the projects in the CIP are
requested and budgetary authority is granted on an incremental basis.

Road & Bridge Projects: $292.5 million requested for planned investments
in transporta on infrastructure and construc on, maintenance and repair of
roads and bridges within the County under the direc on of Department of
Public Works - Engineer
County Airport: $45.9 million is planned for maintenance and improvements
of the buildings, runways and equipment at the County Airport in Richmond
Heights. The building projects are managed by the Department of Public
Works – Central Services.
Sanitary Sewers: $46.9 million is planned for construc on, maintenance and
repair and relining of sewers, pump sta ons and wastewater treatment facilies in the County sewer districts that are operated by the Department of Public Works – Sanitary Engineer.
Building Improvements: $391.6 million is planned for construc on,
rehabilita on, maintenance and repair of County owned buildings and
proper es managed the Department of Public Works - Central Services.
InformaƟon Technology: $47.8 million is iden fied for investments in Countywide data and network infrastructure, telecommunica ons equipment and
informa on systems and applica ons.
Funding for the $824.7 million capital improvement program comes from a
number of diﬀerent sources. Local revenues include the General Fund; Special
Levy and Special Revenue Funds with earmarked dollars; User Fees for projects benefit the users; local share from municipali es and debt financing that
allocates costs over the project’s useful life. The majority of funding in the
proposed 2014-2018 Capital Improvements plan is from Debt Issuance (46.9%)
ed to funding for Building improvements.
The County’s five year capital plan es together infrastructure needs with financial resources, allowing every dollar to be maximized and leveraged. This
ensures the maximum useful life for assets, and the appropriate financing
method for individual projects. Long term financing makes sense for projects

IntroducƟon
with long useful lives to allocate costs over the life of the asset. In the case
of annual equipment purchases, annual revenues are appropriate. Thus, it is
these decisions that fall within the scope of this Capital Improvements Plan.
The outline of the Capital Improvements Plan is presented in the next sec on.
This plan is presented in the same document with the opera ng budget plan
because decisions regarding capital improvements impact the opera ng budget. Construc on of a new facility or expansion of sewer service into a new
district aﬀects staﬃng and opera ng costs while long-term financing requires
principal and interest payments from the opera ng budget. Capital planning
decisions consider the overall impact, whether it is current year revenues for
an oﬃce renova on or long term debt for a new administra on building.
Project funding is o en linked to the respec ve opera ng budgets of the County. The local match for Road and Bridge projects includes the transfer of auto
tle fees collected in the Engineer Fund. Annual debt service payments for
bonds issued for building and informa on technology investments is carved
out of general fund property tax collec ons. The construc on of new buildings and upgrades to facili es may also require addi onal ongoing opera ng
expenses staﬃng.
Organization of the Capital Improvements Plan
This por on of the 2014-2018 Budget Plan previews 2014 capital improvements, in addi on to the long-range plan for 2015-2018. The five year Capital Improvements Plan stresses long range financial and strategic planning to
address capital improvement needs. As expected, there is more uncertainty
with capital improvements iden fied in later years. Changes in priori es and
resources will alter future Capital Improvements Plans and this should be kept
in mind when reviewing the long range plans.
The ini al step for the Capital Improvements Plan process is to incorporate
planning with priority project needs. An overview of this process, and the budget cycle for capital improvements, is provided in the next sec on. The appropria on requirements for capital improvements also are discussed, since

the opera ng budget and capital plans are appropriated in diﬀerent manners.
The project criteria and financial policies that underlie the capital plan are
discussed next. These criteria are used to evaluate and priori ze requested
capital improvements, while the outlined financial policies guide the County in
funding the five year capital plan.
The remainder of this sec on discusses the 2014-2018 plan. The first year of
the five year plan iden fies the 2014 Capital Improvements Budget, which is
the opera ng guide for capital improvements scheduled in 2014 and beyond.
These projects represent new projects and exis ng projects that are s ll acve. Expenditures reflected for exis ng projects only include the por on of
the project budget remaining to be spent.
Summary informa on is presented for capital improvements by project category, program type and funding source. A general descrip on of the capital plan’s impact on the opera ng budget follows the summary informa on.
Detailed capital improvement lis ngs for each agency follow the introductory
sec on. The individual project group sec ons include an introduc on to program ac vi es, 2013 accomplishments, 2014-2018 planned improvements,
financing sources, and the impact on the opera ng budget. The highlighted
departments in the capital plan are the managing agencies for each project
segment including the Department of Public Works, County Airport and Informa on Technology. In addi on to these departments the County Execu ve’s
Oﬃce and the Oﬃce of Budget & Management and play a significant role in
priori za on and planning.
Capital Improvements Budget Cycle
The County has con nued its eﬀorts to improve the capital improvement
planning process. County capital improvement needs are assessed during the
budget development cycle and these needs are then documented and submitted through the capital budge ng/planning process. This process, which concludes with the prepara on of the capital plan for submission to County Council for adop on alongside the biennial opera ng budget. The adopted plan
is included in the budget plan document. The County Execu ve and County

VIII-2

Capital Plan
IntroducƟon
administra ve staﬀ set priori es at this higher level with assistance from the
Department of Public Works, Department of Development, Informa on Services and the Oﬃce of Budget & Management.
The ini al step in the planning process is comple on a first quarter capital
plan review in April. This review process entails a high level assessment of
the adopted plan and updates the exis ng funding model for projects. The
resul ng report from the review assessment reaﬃrms the current priori es
and recommends revisions to the CIP if necessary. The need for addi onal
capital resources, or the availability of new funds, allows the County to evaluate projects and focus dollars on high priority and address emergency needs.
Changes to the plan are referred to Council for approval through the normal
legisla ve process.

The Department of Public Works prepares a proposed dra capital plan for the
next planning period for the majority of the project groups (Road & Bridge,
Sanitary Sewer and Buildings). Dra proposals for the Airport and Informa on
Technology are combined in the dra CIP to include all five project segments.
The County Fiscal Oﬃce, and OBM then review the dra plan and complete the
evalua on of priori es and verify funding sources. The proposed capital plan
is prepared based on this completed review and compiled into a report format
and is generally completed in September.
The proposed five year capital plan is compiled in report format that includes
the charter requirements set forth in sec on 2.03, paragraph 10:
 Capital improvements scheduled to be undertaken in the current year

A Midyear Capital Project Status Report is completed as part of the midyear
budget review process. This integrates the opera ng and capital budgets for
a combined review and highlights poten al impacts that capital projects may
have on the opera ng budget. Major changes in the capital plan also are discussed with project lead departments to determine any long term impact and
necessary ac ons to resolve pending issues with the current CIP.
As part of the midyear review and in prepara on for the opera ng budget development process, OBM reviews the capital improvement financial policies
and sets parameters for the upcoming budget cycle. At the same me, project
group lead agencies conduct an annual assessment of ongoing and future project needs within their respec ve CIP segment. Although an ongoing process,
the annual review during this period incorporates recent capital ac vity, iden fies changes to the capital plan and provides informa on necessary for the upcoming budget process. A high level review of capital improvement priori es
is conducted to prime the dra plan formula on. The ini al planning review
is intended to define priori es and funding capacity. The County Execu ve
determines priori es for the CIP and funding levels and specific project needs
are developed by Public Works and OBM.

 Proposed cost of each project
 Proposed method of financing each project
 Capital improvements projected for the next five years
The proposed plan is submi ed with the Execu ve’s Recommended Budget by
the required submission date outlined in the County’s biennial budget resoluon (R2013-0229). The final Capital Improvements Plan is reviewed during
the budget hearing process conducted by Council and is ul mately approved
as part of the adopted appropria on measure.
Capital Improvement Appropriations
Council has the sole authority to appropriate funds for County opera ng and
capital expenditures. While the opera ng budget is appropriated annually,
capital project appropria ons are established at project ini a on and remain
in eﬀect for the dura on of each project. Capital project appropria ons are
approved by Council via the normal legisla ve process.

VIII-3

Capital Plan
IntroducƟon
Due to legal requirements, County Council must annually authorize capital
project appropria ons. This “roll over” authorizes capital improvement appropria ons for a new fiscal year. Since a number of projects are mul year, this
“roll over” allows appropria on approval at the es mated total dollar amount
with expenditures tracked over several years. Thus, a final project report will
show project-to-date, rather than any one fiscal year expenditures.
The County maintains separate accounts (subfunds and projects) for all capital
projects to record project expenditures and revenues on an individual project
basis. Projects authorized by Council are also are categorized separately on
the County’s accoun ng system. For example, general capital improvements
will be in Fund Number 40, while County Airport and Sanitary Engineer capital
projects would be in Fund Numbers 52 and 54, respec vely.
The one excep on to this separa on of opera ng and capital budgets is the
Department of Public Works Road & Bridge Division. The opera ng budget
includes both opera ng and capital accounts, although there is a separate division for capital project expenses. These capital projects are tracked with a
separate project accoun ng system due to the number of project managed at
one me. The summary accoun ng data for each project is shared with the
County’s accoun ng system and reconciled annually. Contracts for these projects are subject to appropria on approved by Council. The County’s share of
local road and bridge projects is normally funded out of special revenue funds
managed by the Department of Public Works.
Capital Improvement Criteria
Capital improvement requests exceed available resources. Because of this,
priori es must be established to guide capital planning. Specific criteria have
been selected by OBM for reviewing capital improvement requests, depending
upon the type of project. These criteria are highlighted below, with references
to specific applica ons in the County’s capital planning process:
1. The value of the capital asset should represent a material amount, generally greater than $25,000. Applica on: if a project request is for a miVIII-4

nor amount, the benefi ng agency normally u lizes capital outlay appropria on included their opera ng budget. This minimizes the impact
on capital funds, especially when several agencies have capital requests.
Although not a set figure, the materiality of the project allows capital
dollars to fund major improvements that are o en mul agency in scope.
2. The capital improvement should have a useful life of at least five years
for equipment and ten years for all other projects. If debt financed, the
useful life should at least equal the debt issue maturity. Applica on:
The County maintains approximately five million square feet of owned
and leased space. The useful life of an improvement must be considered
as part of the overall space planning issue. The review and approval of
building renova on requests, ensures that renova ons do not become
outdated as changes occur.
3. The age and condi on of the asset should be considered. While rehabilita on is necessary for older capital assets, newer assets also require
improvements due to changing condi ons. Applica on: There is a pressing need for improvements due to both aging and outdated condi ons
in County facili es. The capital improvements plan a empts to balance
these needs but it is diﬃcult with limited financial resources. The County
Jus ce Center for example is a 35 year old building which has growing
maintenance and space needs due to growing workloads on the jus ce
system.
4. The cost of the capital improvement must be kept in mind for the overall
plan. This is especially true for major projects that require more planning and impact the ability to finance other capital projects and opera ng
needs. Applica on: As Public Works assesses the needs for improving
exis ng County buildings the total cost of requested improvements must
be balanced with the opera onal capacity to finance improvements as
well as maintain the space.
5. The project’s importance to the health and safety of the County’s ci zens
is a high priority. Applica on: The Department of Public Work’s Road &
Bridge five year capital plan considers the safety factor in annual bridge
inspec ons. Where bridges are inadequate and even safety risks, County,

Capital Plan
IntroducƟon
State and/or Federal dollars will be earmarked in some cases to ensure
project comple on.
6. Priority will be given for the maintenance or enhancement of exis ng
assets. The present infrastructure is the basis for County Government
opera ons and a major strength of the Cleveland Metropolitan Area. Applica on: The 2014-2018 CIP projects iden fied for maintenance ($39.4
million) and rehabilita on ($356.4 million) represents a commitment to
the present infrastructure. These expenditures over the next five years
will show significant value through increased life for exis ng capital assets.
7. A cost benefit analysis will be part of project evalua on. Benefits should
be measured in specific terms, such as popula on served or ability to
generate revenues to cover project costs. Applica on: for Sanitary Sewer
projects, users must be able to absorb project costs through user fees
assessed to each district. This should be true whether user fees cover
expenses on a one year basis or over a long term period through issuance
of long term debt.
8. The level of resources plays a cri cal role in the capital project planning
process. The ability to leverage outside resources (State and federal dollars) and the genera on of new revenues has to be factored into the crea on of the CIP. Applica on: The County’s ability to generate non General Fund revenues will play a cri cal role in funding future capital needs.
A major factor in planning the transporta on projects (roads, bridges
and airport) is the ability to leverage intergovernmental funding and to
secure for addi onal funding. The County can minimize internal funding

VIII-5

by matching the commitment of outside dollars. Over 60.8% of Road and
Bridge project funding is expected to be derived from State and federal
sources.
9. A value engineering perspec ve is considered in comple ng capital projects. A roof repair should occur before the damaged ceiling is fixed, and
improvements to sewers should be completed prior to road rehabilitaon. Applica on: The CIP structures projects so that work in one area,
as men oned above, occurs prior to work in the following area. As an
example this can be seen in the County Courthouse, where roof replacement was completed before work began on the replacement of the buildings HVAC and air handling equipment.
10. A project’s ability to handle growth and promote economic development
becomes an important factor. Improvements or expansions to the exis ng
system may be required to allow new development or to meet increased
demands from exis ng users. Applica on the physical infrastructure is
an integral part of economic development, and system expansions help
achieve this objec ve. At the same me the County maintains exis ng
systems (see Criteria No. 5) to assure stability and prevent the loss of
residents and/or system users. Areas frequently discussed in this manner
are sewer system expansions and road and bridge development, and the
County Airport.

Capital Plan
Capital Improvement Financial Policies
Improvements to the County’s capital assets, combined with the addi on of
new assets, require significant resources. These expenditures benefit the
County and its ci zens by extending the useful life of its assets and providing new assets. Decisions regarding capital improvement financing impact the
availability of resources for both daily opera ons and future capital improvements. Funding decisions must be made in light of short and long term resources and coincide with the life and cost of the assets. The financial policies
that guide the capital improvement planning process are described below:

and provision of direct services to ci zens. The County will maintain capital funding at exis ng levels, will avoid deferring maintenance to cut costs
and will not neglect the County’s capital inventory.
2. The County will only commit to capital projects within its ability to fi-

nance improvements using short and long term resources. Debt issuance
to finance capital improvements is based on the County’s debt limita ons
at the me and the ability to pay the debt over the issue’s life without
degrading the General Fund opera ng status.
3. Financing decisions must balance pay as you go financing (current cash

resources) versus long term financing (debt). The use of current resources to finance capital improvements represents restraint in incurring long
term obliga ons. The General Fund annually subsidizes an amount general capital improvements that is commensurate with resources available
for the current budget period. Funding is usually limited to smaller projects that do not exceed $300,000. At the same me, financing decisions
should consider the improvement’s useful life and allocate capital costs
over their useful life. This method ensures that funded projects provide
the most benefit.
4. The County will promote and encourage the leveraging of resources to

maximize capital improvement eﬀorts. This includes intergovernmental programs, public/private partnerships, service charges and user fees,
and debt issuance. A periodic review of building and other infrastructure
holdings will be conducted in order to consider alterna ve uses or disVIII-6

maintain the capital asset. To highlight this long term factor, the Capital
Improvements Plan is developed concurrently with the Biennial Operating Budget.

Chester in Cleveland ($47.3 million).

The 2014-2018 Capital Improvements Plan totals $824.7 million. These capital
improvements are categorized into eight project types: 1.) maintenance, 2.)
rehabilita on/reconstruc on, 3.) expansion/new construc on, 4.) equipment,
5.) health and safety, 6.) renova on 7.) energy management, 8.) and informaon technology.

Expansion/New Construction

Maintenance
This category includes both preven ve and major maintenance projects. Preven ve maintenance includes work on buildings, proper es and infrastructure
to ensure the con nuing day to day opera on of the property. Major maintenance is non rou ne work extending the asset’s useful life.
As Figure CIP 1 indicates, $39.4 million dollars or 4.8% of total dollars are for
maintenance projects. Most of the reported projects are sanitary sewer projects ($7.8 million). Maintenance project expenditures evenly distributed over
the five year plan horizon. The largest 2012 maintenance project is the ongoing sanitary sewer relining contract ($3.0 million) and in place for all five years
of the plan ($15.0 million).

While the first two categories focused on exis ng assets, this category covers
facility expansion and new construc on. Many projects are based on development and growth; residen al development requires new sewer lines, and rising caseloads increase oﬃce space Jus ce Center space needs. Although the
number of projects is small, dollars are significant and extensive planning is
required for this category.
During the next five years, $305.3 million or 37.0% of the five-year plan is for
expansion/new construc on. Much of the new expansion in the 2014-2018
plan is for the County Hotel ($266.0 million). Public Works has a major expansion project planned for the Towpath Trail at a projected cost of just under
$39.6 million.

Rehabilitation/Reconstruction
This category represents projects that restore the asset to its original condi on
or reconstruct the asset in a new configura on. These projects o en extend
the asset’s useful life, as in the case of road and bridge improvements. Other projects improve opera ng environments, such as oﬃce remodeling. Like
many governmental units across the country, Cuyahoga County’s infrastructure
includes older assets that require rehabilita on and reconstruc on over the
next five years.
As noted in Figure CIP 1, $356.4 million or 43.2% of total dollars are allocated for this category. The largest share is for various road and bridge projects
($237.9 million) including the rehabilita on of the East 105th St. Quincy to

Equipment
Renovation
The equipment category represents major equipment purchases with a significant dollar value and a useful life exceeding five years. This category includes
vehicles and equipment u lized for maintenance and repair ac vi es as well as
telecommunica ons and informa on technology (IT) equipment. Passenger
vehicles and equipment used in daily opera ons are not included in this category. While equipment can be included CIP, funding also occurs through the
opera ng budget process.
Equipment purchases in the capital plan account for 0.9% of the total, or $7.7
million. Over 85% of this category is devoted to Airport related equipment.
Project expenditures on equipment can include the installa on of emergency generators at sewer system pump sta ons and HVAC upgrades at various
County buildings.
Health and Safety
This category totals $37.2 million and includes projects that are necessary to
maintain a safe working and opera ng improvements for both County employees and the public. As an example, the 2014-2018 plan includes safety items
such as repair to County Airport Runways and Aprons totaling $37.2 million.
The focus of these repairs is to maintain a safe air facility and not defer the
con nued upgrades to the infrastructure. The remainder of investments in
health and safety are to various building systems that include HVAC and other
safety sytems.

This category represents projects that restore the asset to its original condi on.
The diﬀeren a on from Rehabilita on construc on projects is the more oneme nature of these projects. Renova ons are represented by one $900,000
project to make electrical upgrades at the County Airport.
Energy Management
This category includes improvements to County facili es that will increase the
energy eﬃciency of building opera on. The projects in this category will have
a measurable break even point in which the project expenditures will be recovered in a five to ten year me frame. The share of energy management projects at $0. The current plan will evolve to include more investments in energy
management once a more thorough review in County buildings is completed
in 2014.
Information Technology
The CIP includes $47.8 million that has been iden fied for investments in
County-wide data and network infrastructure, telecommunica ons equipment
and informa on systems and applica ons. The inclusion of IT and communicaons related an investment is new to the County’s CIP. This category is very
relevant to the CIP process as the County has iden fied various investments in
technology to undertake in the next two years. Past versions of the CIP had
combined investments in telecommunica ons and technology with building
projects. The investments in this category are significant enough to warrant a

(thousands)

Funding for the $824.7 million capital improvement program comes from a
number of diﬀerent sources. Local revenues include the General Fund, Special
Levy and Special Revenue Funds with earmarked dollars; User Fees for projects
benefit the users; and debt financing that allocates costs over the project’s
useful life.
As Figure CIP 4 highlights, future debt issuance funds 46.9% ($387.1 million)
of total capital dollars. These dollars fund building projects ($339.8 million).
Road and Bridge is funded by federal dollars totaling $153.7 million.
State funding represents 4.6% or $26.9 million of all capital funding. The enre share of state funding is for road and bridge projects through the Department of Public Works. The State money flows through the Ohio Department of
Transporta on (ODOT) and Issue I to fund all $26.9 million in projects.
The other sources category includes matching funds from local governments
on road and bridge projects, and private development projects under the Sanitary Sewer District, which account for $42.8 million or 5.2% of all capital dollars. In most cases, the other sources funds have been leveraged by county
resources, increasing the County’s resource base.

State Issue I Program
Local Transportation Improvement Program (State Issue I)
In 1987, Ohio voters approved a cons tu onal amendment authorizing the
State to issue $1.2 billion in bonds for local infrastructure improvements for
ten years. The Ohio General Assembly enacted legisla on to implement State
Issue II in 1988. In November 1995, Ohioans voted to renew this program for
another ten years.
The Local Transporta on Improvement Program (LTIP) was created by the legislature in 1989 and currently provides approximately $52 million in gasoline
tax receipts annually (the equivalent of one cent). Since the use of such receipts is cons tu onally limited to roads and bridges only coun es, ci es, villages and townships may apply for these funds. Applicants may apply for grants
up to 100% of the project cost.
The distribu on of funds occurs on a district-by-district basis. The State is divided into 19 districts with Cuyahoga County designated as District One. Each
district then creates a commi ee to oversee the applica on process. Cuyahoga
County’s District Commi ee consists of seven individuals, with two appointees
each from the County, the City of Cleveland, and suburban communi es. The
seventh individual is appointed by the previously men oned members and is
a private sector representa ve. This commi ee priori zes and recommends
projects for Issue II funding. These recommenda ons are submi ed to the
Ohio Public Works Commission, which approves projects and processes payments from the bond proceeds to the local communi es.

assessment of the condi on of these assets, a five year plan detailing the local government’s capital improvement needs and a two year maintenance of
capital eﬀort report.
The State requires that the District Commi ee evaluate projects using ten specific criteria including an evalua on of the community’s economic health and
ability to finance infrastructure projects. This is required to ensure that funds
are targeted toward communi es in need. Up to 20% of the Issue 2 alloca on
must be awarded in the form of low interest loans rather than grants. Beginning in 1996 the loan repayments (principal and interest) are to be redistributed to the districts for addi onal capital improvements.
In 2006, State Issue II was replaced with State Issue I, which was part of the
Governor’s Third Fron er Project. The County’s road and bridge and sanitary
sewer projects are eligible for Issue I funding. The County Department of Public Works has iden fied the Issue I Program as a funding source for over $26.9
million towards various projects. See Figure. Since 1993 the County has qualified for over $50 million in LTIP funding.

Eligibility for funding is limited to specific projects. These include roads, bridges, sanitary and storm sewer collec on, water supply and distribu on, wastewater treatment facili es and solid waste disposal systems. Issue II funds rehabilita on projects at up to 90% of the total cost and funds new/expansion
projects at 50% of the total cost. LTIP funds are limited for use on road and
bridge projects only and are eligible for 100% funding. Eligible costs for all
projects include purchase of property and facili es, planning, construc on, reconstruc on, improvements and equipment. To be eligible for funding, each
community must complete an inventory of exis ng capital infrastructure, an

Capital Improvement Versus the OperaƟng Budget
Capital Improvements Versus the Operating Budget
Capital improvement decisions must occur concurrently with the opera ng
budget, since improvements o en impact opera ng costs. The 2014-2015
budget merges these two processes, with capital improvement requests submi ed and reviewed through the biennial budget process. Project requests
were reviewed to determine their impact on current and future opera ng budgets. The impact of these capital improvements on opera ng budgets is highlighted in the detailed capital plans that follow this sec on.
The major focus of the County’s capital plan in regards to the opera ng budget is physical infrastructure maintenance. The Department of Public Works
is charged with these major ac vi es, and their plans include a number of
projects that aﬀect opera ng budgets. There are a number of energy projects
to upgrade and replace aging systems, improving energy services and reduce
costs. While the Department expends significant resources for infrastructure
maintenance, the major impact for the opera ng budget is new ac vity. This
occurs because most renova ons and improvements do not impact opera ng
needs. For example, roof replacements generally occur a er many years and
do not change opera ng costs. Oﬃce renova ons that provide a more producve employee environment do not impact costs unless staﬀ numbers change.

Capital funding levels will not exceed the opera ng budget for the Sanitary
Sewer Division in 2014-2015. Depending upon the County’s future expansion
decisions, opera ng budgets could change over the long run. If the County
expands the system and opera ng budgets con nue to increase, user fee increases and new system users would be necessary to maintain new infrastructure and pay principal and interest on future debt issues. The current slate of
sewer projects are funded 76.6% with district user fees.
Capital funding for the County Airport should have minimal impact on the opera ng budget. Opera ng resources are stable for this Enterprise Fund, with
capital dollars funding maintenance of the exis ng Airport infrastructure. The
planned expansion of the runways to allow for more ac vity will have an opera ng impact on the Airport opera ons. The full amount for this impact will
be indeterminate un l the funding for the proposed improvements is locked
down. This benchmark for proceeding is in turn dependent on the viability of
the Airport plan as it relates to the acceptance by surrounding communi es for
increased air traﬃc and related ac vity.

VIII-12

Capital Plan
Road & Bridge
The Department of Public Works – Road and Bridge Division is responsible
for the construc on, reconstruc on, improvement, maintenance and repair of
all roads and bridges within the County that fall under the jurisdic on of the
County Execu ve. Major maintenance and rehabilita on of these roads and
bridges, which comprise the County’s transporta on system, are completed
through a capital improvements planning process requiring a high degree of
intergovernmental coopera on. Federal and State governments play a major
role in maintaining County roads and bridges by funding 52.5% of the 20142018 Capital Improvements Program plan. The remaining projects are funded
by the County (31.3%), the state ($8.3%) and municipali es (7.8%).
The Federal agency involved with road and bridge projects is the Federal
Highway Administra on, part of the U.S. Department of Transporta on. The
majority of Federal funds are requested through the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordina ng Agency (NOACA). NOACA coordinates requests from all
jurisdic ons in Northeast Ohio (Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina
Coun es), helping local governments priori ze capital needs. In 1997, ODOT
turned the administra on of the county por on of the Local Bridge Program
over to the County Engineer’s Associa on of Ohio (CEOA). The Transporta on
Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) was passed by the U.S. Congress in
1998.

While most construc on is done by private contractors, the Road and Bridge
Division operates three maintenance yards and a sign shop across the County
(see Figure CIP 6) to support maintenance and repair ac vi es. A staﬀ of 38
performs these ac vi es u lizing necessary equipment and heavy vehicles.
The maintenance yard at Miles Road was recently closed with the equipment
being transferred to other yards. The Road and Bridge Division presently provides infrastructure maintenance through road and bridge maintenance, and
weather related maintenance based on driving condi ons (i.e. ice and snow
removal). However, municipali es are performing a larger share of weather
related maintenance since these condi ons are more localized and be er controlled at that level. Thus, the Road and Bridge Division’s eﬀorts focus on actual
maintenance of bridges and roads, and assis ng municipali es with the improvement of over 794 lane miles of County roadway. This increased ac vity
should extend these assets’ useful life, and target capital dollars to areas in
greatest need.

The Ohio Department of Transporta on (ODOT) is the state agency that parcipates in the local infrastructure process for roads and bridges. ODOT must
approve all federally funded projects, and the financing process for these projects involves the State as a pass through agency. ODOT also provides the local
match for federally funded projects on state or interstate routes (see Funding
Sources).
The Road and Bridge Division works closely with municipali es, assis ng with
the planning, financing and construc on phase on many projects. These local
partnership eﬀorts represent over half of the Road and Bridge Division’s projects during the next five years and allow the County to meet local and regional
infrastructure needs.

The Road and Bridge Division is responsible for 186 bridges on County roads
and State highways in Cuyahoga County. Major bridges under the Road and
Bridge Division’s jurisdic on, in the City of Cleveland, are the Veterans Memorial; Harvard Denison; Hope Memorial; Brooklyn-Brighton; and Burton Memorial (Main Avenue), Ohio’s longest bridge. In suburban communi es, County
bridges include Detroit Road in Lakewood and Rocky River; Northfield Road in
Bedford; Lorain Road in Fairview Park and Cleveland; Brookpark Road in Fairview Park; Hilliard Road in Lakewood and Rocky River; Rockside Road in Maple
Heights; Cli on-West Lake in Lakewood and Rocky River; and Broadway Whitehouse Crossing in Garfield Heights. Bridges are inspected, at least, annually
according to criteria established by ODOT.

2013 Highlights
The Department of Public Works assumed responsibility for the Road and
Bridge Division when the Charter form of government took hold in January
2011. Prior to this new form of government, the Road and Bridge Division fell
under the purview of an elected County Engineer. Under the new government,
this division was rolled into the Department of Public Works and the engineer
in charge of the en re department is now appointed by the County Execu ve.
The Road and Bridge Division is now combined with the Sanitary Engineer and
Facili es Management divisions under the Department of Public Works.

These inspec ons result in ra ngs u lized to determine capital improvement
priori es. As Figure CIP 7 indicates, the current inventory includes 81 bridges
constructed before 1950. The average age of bridges under the County’s control is about 51 years. Due to their age, an intensive maintenance and repair
program is required. Rehabilita on is possible to extend the useful life of the
structure but replacement may be necessary to ensure the health and safety
of those using the transporta on system. In either case, improvements are
designed to extend the useful life of a bridge by 20 to 50 years.

miles of this system in two unincorporated (township) areas. Capital improvements include federally funded resurfacing/rehabilita on projects; grade,
drain and pave projects; design and construc on of new roads; locally funded
reconstruc on and resurfacing projects; slide repair; and culvert replacement.
The need for these projects is based on both road condi on and the number
of cars that use a par cular road. Improvements extend the useful life of the
roadway from seven to twenty years. Since these capital improvements o en

Road & Bridge
The Road and Bridge Division started or completed approximately $51.2 million in major capital improvements during 2013. The focus of the 2013 ac vity was rehabilita on and reconstruc on of the exis ng transporta on system.
Highlights of 2013 include the Rockside Road Phase II project ($5.2 million)
in the City of Independence. Work included the rehabilita on of Ridge Road
I-480 to Memphis $4.2 million and Taylor Road Euclid to East Cleveland ($3.1
million). The remainder of the 2013 projects included road resurfacing, culvert repair, and bridge deck sealing in various Cuyahoga County municipali es.

The Road and Bridge Division has approximately $46.6 million targeted for
bridge rehabilita on/replacement type projects. The replacement and rehabilita on of 17 bridges is included in the plan. A significant por on, $24.8 million, of the current CIP dollars allo ed for bridges are for the rehabilita on of
three bridges: two bridges at Rockside Road and one bridge at Highland Road.
Bridge work is also scheduled for structures in Glenwillow, Cleveland, Lindale,
Euclid, Bratenahl, Gates Mills, Middelburg Heights, Parma and Brookpark. The
Engineer’s plan includes four culvert rehabilita on projects totaling $1.3 million.

2014-2018 Capital Improvements Program
The Road and Bridge Division’s five year Capital Improvements Program is comprised of $292.5 million for improvements to local roads and bridges. As shown
in Figure CIP 8, almost all of the 2014-2018 plan is categorized as rehabilita on
and reconstruc on type projects. The increase in this current CIP over the previous year is due to the increased es mates for several major projects including li bridge rehabs in the city of Cleveland and the updated es mate for the
Towpath Trail Phase IV project.
Rehabilita on and reconstruc on of the exis ng transporta on system over
the next five years will focus on three specific areas: road grade, drain and
pave projects; bridge and culvert rehabilita on/replacement; and road repair/
resurfacing.
Approximately $245.9 million or 84.1% of the five-year plan is devoted to road
grading, resurfacing and repair work. The Road and Bridge Division has scheduled 39 such projects over the next five years. The average cost for these types
of projects is $5.6 million but they range in size from $65,000 for smaller repair projects to $47.7 million for larger projects like the rehabilita on of East
105th Quincy to Chester in Cleveland. Most road projects receive 52.5% Federal funding with the remaining 47.5% split between the State, County or local
sources.

The other areas of rehabilita on and reconstruc on category include upgrade
to intersec ons, signal upgrades and grade separa on projects. The major
grade separa on project in the CIP is the Stearns Road grade separa on in
Olmsted Township and is es mated to cost $13.5 million.
The expansion component of the Road and Bridge Division’s plan is a ributed
to the expansion of the Towpath Trail through the city of Cleveland all the way
to the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. The project is a collabora ve eﬀort between the County, the city of Cleveland, Cleveland Metroparks and the Ohio
Canal Corridor Inc. The expansion is expected to be completed in four stages
over the five year dura on of the CIP with construc on beginning in 2013 and
finishing in 2018. The total es mated cost for design, acquisi on and construcon of the trail is $39.3 million.

Funding Sources
Maintenance of the local transporta on system involves Federal, State, County and municipal funding. Any project in the Road and Bridge Division’s five
year plan has poten al for intergovernmental funding. To the extent possible,
County and municipal funds are leveraged against Federal and State sources.
Federal funding for road and bridge improvements is available through programs administered by the Federal Highway Administra on, part of the U.S.
Department of Transporta on. The passage of The Transporta on Equity Act

VIII-15

Capital Plan
Road & Bridge
for the 21st Century in 1998 set the guidelines for federal funding on local projects. While actual funding is dependent upon availability of funds and type of
project, most federally funded projects are 52.5% federal and 47.5% local on
average.
The Road and Bridge’s five year plan includes $153.7 million in Federal dollars,
represen ng 52.5% of the total plan.

Conges on Mi ga on/Air Quality (CM/AQ) Funds: These funds were created
through the 1991 transporta on bill. Funding is targeted for projects that mi gate conges on or contribute to air quality and help meet the region’s air quality a ainment status. The funding level is 80% federal/20% local. Many municipali es use these funds for signaliza on projects, which do not require County
par cipa on and receive 100% federal funding.
State Sources

As with Federal dollars, State matching dollars vary by program. The State
will contribute resources for the five-year plan predominately on State route
bridge projects at 20% of project costs. An outline of the major Federal and
State financing programs for road and bridge rehabilita on is provided below.
Federal Sources
Surface Transporta on Program (STP): Funds are available for construc on,
total reconstruc on, and resurfacing of collectors, principal arterials and minor
arterials in urban areas with popula ons over 200,000. These funds, previously known as “M Funds” and now classified as STP (Surface Transporta on)
Funds in the new transporta on bill, are passed through the Ohio Department
of Transporta on. Construc on costs are usually matched on an 80 percent
federal, 20 percent local basis. The County may provide all or most of the local match on projects, with addi onal local matching funds provided by one or
more municipali es.

The Ohio Department of Transporta on (ODOT) conducts its own program of
road improvements for State maintained roadways. There is no direct funding
from the State to the County for road improvements under the jurisdic on of
the Road and Bridge Division. The State will act as a conduit for federal funds
on many projects, as noted in the Federal Sources Sec on.
Direct State funding is provided for bridge projects on Federal and State Routes.
ODOT funds up to 100% of project costs. Where projects are federally funded,
ODOT may provide 100% of the local match or 20% of the project costs. State
funding is available through the Issue I Program as previously discussed. The
current CIP includes 11 projects that would u lize a total of $23.0 million in
State Issue I funding (See State Issue I Program in the Capital Plan Introduc on
sec on). Most of these projects assume the State award will cover an average
of 33% of the project cost.
Local Sources

Bridge Rehabilita on and Replacement (BR) Funds: Construc on costs for
these projects are usually matched at a rate of 80 percent federal, 20 percent
local. There were no major changes to this program in the 1998 transportaon bill. The local match for bridge projects is provided through the Road and
Bridge Division’s revenue sources. Funds also are eligible for bridges on local
streets. In recent years federal dollars have funded 100% of bridge projects
and varies from year to year. The 2012 CIP assumes the 100% funding scenario
for the current planning horizon.

The Road and Bridge Division and municipali es provide the local shares necessary to leverage State and Federal dollars. In addi on, some projects are
funded solely with local dollars.
Resources for the County’s por on of capital improvements come from two
major revenue sources. The first is a $5.00 Motor Vehicle License Fee enacted
in 1968. This fee generated $5.0 million in 2013, and historically had been the
major source for funding capital improvements. Some design and planning acvi es are also funded through this source.

Operating Impact

Due to the growing need for improvements in the transporta on system, the
State of Ohio enacted legisla on in 1987 that allowed coun es and municipali es to increase Motor Vehicle License Fees. In 1987, the Board of County
Commissioners authorized a $10.00 increase in Motor Vehicle License Fees.
This increase is split between the County and municipali es, with $7.50 to the
County and $2.50 to municipali es. The Road and Bridge Division collected $7.6
million through this addi onal fee in 2013. The State’s legisla ve ac on also
enabled municipali es to implement a $5.00 increase to generate addi onal
resources for local improvements. These resources have no direct impact on
the County, although they may be used as a local share for intergovernmental
projects. The County’s share of project funding stands at approximately $91.7
million over the next five years.

The Road and Bridge Division’s opera ng budget includes funds for design,
engineering and planning func ons related to the five year capital plan. To
meet these needs, staﬀ and equipment are necessary and, where appropriate,
professional services may be used on a project by project basis. With the five
year capital plan focusing on rehabilita on and reconstruc on projects, there
is a direct impact on the opera ng budget. The five year plan is based on an
annual review of road and bridge condi ons. Roads and bridges in the worst
condi on, requiring higher maintenance costs, are repaired first. Thus, maintenance costs should fall as comple on of these projects minimizes road and
bridge maintenance needs.

The engineer has accumulated significant cash balances. Balances in the Road
and Bridge Fund totaled $28.3 million at the beginning of 2014. Balances in
the $5.00 fund and the $7.50 fund totaled $22.7 million at the beginning of
2014. Total cash in all three funds totaled $51.0 million at the beginning of

Capital Plan
County Airport
Cuyahoga County operates, administers and maintains a 660-acre general avia on/reliever airport cer fied by the Federal Avia on Administra on (FAA).
The County Airport supports the general air transporta on requirements of
industrial and commercial businesses, serving both private and business aircra . As a “reliever airport,” it supplements the air service of Cleveland Hopkins Interna onal Airport and other regional airports.
To complement air transporta on services, the County Airport has overseen
the development of adjacent land. A 100 acre industrial park has been developed to handle commercial and light industrial firms. Since its incep on in
1982, the industrial park has a racted many companies, crea ng over 1,200
jobs and genera ng private investment.
In addi on to the public investment, an 18 hole public golf course is adjacent
to the County Airport. The privately financed and operated Airport Greens
opened in the spring of 1991. The County receives a por on of revenues
through a lease with the private developer/operator. Also contained on the
premises are a full- service restaurant, jogging trail and nine-hole disc golf
course.
In 2012, the Cuyahoga County Airport was moved from the Department of Development to the Department of Public Works. Synergies exist between the
maintenance of an airport and the engineering and maintenance capabili es
of the Department of Public Works.

and resolves avia on, environmental and socioeconomic issues exis ng in the
community. Another planning tool is the Runway Safety Area (RSA) Study being conducted to address the safety and condi ons of the runway areas. Based
on the study, the Federal Avia on Administra on will make a determina on
regarding needed RSA improvements which will be eligible for Federal funding.
These projects focus on maintaining exis ng facili es, safety standards, and
airfield improvements. As shown in Figure CIP 9, these capital improvements
are categorized into five project types: maintenance, equipment and health/
safety improvements.
Proposed airport improvement projects were based on input from the Cuyahoga
County Airport Advisory Commi ees and comments from local, state and federal representa ves. Project costs were based on unit costs developed by the
consultant from experience at other airports of similar size. For compara ve
purposes, the es mated costs of capital improvements are stated in 2014 dollars. Therefore, these costs should be considered as founda on planning costs
that will likely have to be adjusted regularly to arrive at actual project costs.
In most cases, the actual project costs and corresponding budgeted amounts
will be greater, to account for varying economic condi ons. The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is divided into federal, sponsor, and private funding
por ons. A majority of the airport improvement projects qualify for Federal
Avia on Administra on/Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding. Based
on current legisla on, AIP approved projects are eligible for 95 percent funding. The remaining costs of eligible projects are to be financed by the airport
sponsor (Cuyahoga County).

2012-2016 Capital Improvements Plan
Maintenance
Besides future private investment at the County Airport, approximately $45.8
million in capital improvements are planned for the next five years. The guidance for selec ng projects to be included in the plan is provided by the Airport
Master Plan. The goal of the Airport Master Plan is to provide guidance for future airport development that considers the exis ng and an cipated avia on
demand. The Airport Master Plan is technically sound and financially feasible

The maintenance category represents 2.9% or $1.3 million of the five-year capital plan, which includes the construc on of the taxiway.

The Airport has budgeted 15.9% or $7.2 million for equipment acquisi ons
over the five year period. In two years from now, the airport an cipates replacing all the electrical wiring and transformers in its field ligh ng loop; correc ng
security deficiencies by upda ng airfield access gates, hangar doors and security access control systems; and, in 2015, reducing airport noise by installing an
airport run-up enclosure.
Health/Safety Improvements
The five year plan includes 81.2% or $37.2 million in health and safety improvements. To reduce the county’s liability for runway debris damaging aircra
engines, a runway reconstruc on is planned to repair seriously deteriorated
taxiway and apron pavement. This reconstruc on is set to take place in 2015
and will cost $13.5 million. Runway safety area (RSA) improvements consis ng
of design and construc on upgrades and replacements to remove obstruc ons
and grade terrain, make up $21.8 million of the plan. The FAA requires these
safety enhancements to increase airport safety margins. The plan an cipates
the assessment and removal of objects within the Airport airspace by acquiring easements and removing obstruc ons such as trees ($883,332). Finally, in
2016, the plan an cipates installing new fencing to secure the property.
Funding Sources
Most County Airport capital improvements receive funds through Federal and
County programs. The federally funded Airport Improvement Program (AIP)
provides par al funding for Airport capital projects. This funding accounts for
approximately 77.4% of the $45.9 million of total project costs. These categories include maintenance, health and safety, and equipment.

Capital Plan
County Airport
The General Fund is used only when no other dollars are available. The County
Airport already receives an annual subsidy from the General Fund ($487,205
in 2013), and these resources may be reallocated to meet capital needs. Airport projects would then compete with other County projects for funding. The
major considera on is that the General Fund is a last resort for funding Airport
capital projects since the County Execu ve policy calls for enterprise funds to
be self suppor ng. Due to current fiscal constraints, there are limited General
Fund Dollars devoted to the capital plan.

Operating Impact
The County Airport has been successful in leveraging private investment and
intergovernmental resources to develop its facili es and surrounding area.
Capital improvements over the five-year planning period will maintain and improve the Airport and foster development. The Airport’s ability to accommodate growth in the industrial park and maintain opera ons with the proposed
improvements should con nue to increase opera ng revenues and decrease
the General Fund subsidy. Development in the adjacent area also has a posive impact on the County’s General Fund in terms of addi onal real and personal property tax collec ons and contributes to the community’s economic
health. The airport con nues to work toward expanding its customer base and
tenants to generate addi onal revenue.

To highlight the actual opera ng impact, however, two items must be noted.
First, the Airport’s capital improvements have very li le impact on the annual
opera ng budget. A small staﬀ of eleven runs the County Airport and the improvements will not drama cally aﬀect day to day opera ons.
Second, the improvements, while poten ally aﬀec ng the General Fund
through increased capital funding, will not eliminate the exis ng General Fund
subsidy. By fine tuning opera ng eﬃciencies at the Airport, staﬀ has been able
to decrease the General Fund subsidy. The total revenue generated in 2013
from landing fees and rental payments totaled $697,913. This revenue source
is expected to bring in $820,420 in 2014. However, many of the thirty-year
leases of space to private corpora ons are ending, and new leases will produce
increased revenue for Airport opera ons. The Cur ss Wright Center IV lease
adds $25,500 annually and the Eaton lease adds $76-80,000 annually. Expansion at the County Airport to eliminate the subsidy through a major increase in
air traﬃc and opera ons is not in the five-year plan. The plan does consider the
needed increase in ac vity by proposing the major renova on of the runway/
taxiway star ng in 2015 ($13.5 million) and the mul phase installa on of the
Aircra Run-Up Enclosure proposed in 2015-16 ($2.1 million). The feasibility of
expansion has to be examined by the County in conjunc on with surrounding
communi es as well as the available funding for the larger mul year projects
proposed in the 2014-2018 plan.

Sanitary Engineer
The Cuyahoga County Sanitary Engineering Division (CCSE) was established in
1919 to administer the authority now vested in the County Execu ve in matters of wastewater, storm water and water supply management. State law extends to the County Execu ve the authority to create and maintain a Sanitary
Engineering Division under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. In 2011, the County Execu ve appointed a director of Public Works to
oversee the Sanitary opera ons.
One of the least visible and most important components of the Capital Plan
is the Sanitary Engineering Infrastructure. The Department of Public Works
directs an opera on which encompasses 34 communi es and maintains nearly
7.0 million linear feet of sanitary sewers, treats approximately 147 million gallons of wastewater per year and operates 54 sewage-pumping sta ons, as well
as 3 wastewater treatment plants throughout Cuyahoga County. The Division
also has agreements with municipal corpora ons for the establishment, operaon and maintenance of sanitary sewers and facili es. In addi on, standards
for any system connected to or served by a County owned improvement are
established and enforced.
A full range of services is oﬀered to each community, although some communies have separate service departments. In this case the County provides services as requested. The services oﬀered by the County Sanitary Engineer for
sanitary and storm sewer systems include system maintenance, engineering
services, capital planning, construc on inspec on, issuance of sewer connecon permits, and maintenance of engineering and construc on records.
In 2012, the Department of Public Works - Sanitary Engineer Division entered
into an agreement with the City of Shaker Heights to maintain the City’s sewer
system. Under this agreement beginning July 2012, the County will oversee
the maintenance of Shaker Heights’ sanitary sewer system which will become
a district within the County sewer system. The City of Shaker Heights will connue to own the sewer lines and the County will collect funds for the maintenance of the City’s sewer lines.
Working in coopera on with the Ohio Environmental Protec on Agency (Ohio
EPA), the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD), the City of Cleveland Division of Water and the Cuyahoga County Board of Health, the Division

manages a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) used for upgrading or replacing
the exis ng infrastructure and for expanding sewers to un-sewered areas. The
CIP includes informa on about project type, loca on, funding, preliminary engineering and final plan development.
The funds to support ongoing services are generated through district tap in and
user fees, assessments, and charges to private developers. At the same me,
these revenue sources are used to fund capital improvements: repair/replacement of broken or damaged lines, pump sta on maintenance/repairs, wastewater treatment facility renova on/expansion, construc on of new infrastructure, and equipment purchases. Two addi onal revenue sources available for
capital improvements are State Issue I Program Funds and debt financing.
Preventative Maintenance
Before reviewing the 2014 capital project highlights and the 2014-2018 Capital
Plan, it is important to note that the Sanitary Engineer is involved in an ongoing preventa ve maintenance program for the 1,325 miles of sewer lines in the
service areas. This program involving personnel and equipment is undertaken
to ensure the eﬀec ve u liza on of the sewer collec on system and to extend
the system life. The program has five major components:
Jetting and Cleaning
The Sanitary Engineer uses specialized vehicles equipped with jets to propel
water at high speeds through sewer lines to flush sediment and debris, to clear
blockages and to clean out grease or other accumula ons. Lines are normally
cleaned every two years to ensure maximum flow capacity. The Sanitary Engineer presently operates nine Jet and Jet/Vacuum Units for this program.
Televising
Vehicles with television equipment iden fy broken or collapsed sewer lines
for repair and assess the general condi on of the lines. In some cases this is
the only means to inspect the lines, which are televised every five years. The
Sanitary Engineer has five televising units in opera on, with a sixth unit available for backup.

House crews clean and maintain the service sewer lines that run from individual residences and buildings to the main line in the street. These sewers are
flushed and cleaned to remove sediment and blockages on an as needed basis.
This eliminates a major source of the substances that infiltrate the system and
result in major repairs and improvements. The Sanitary Engineer has ten cleaning units in opera on to perform this work. The Division cleans approximately
9,324 house connec ons each year.

Rehab/Recon

Inflow/Infiltration
The inflow and infiltra on program iden fies sec ons of sewer lines that have
ground water infiltra ng the system. Inflow and infiltra on reduces line capacity and may cause major maintenance and repairs. During heavy rainfalls
excessive inflow and infiltra on can cause sewage backups into basements of
low-lying residen al units. This also adds volume to the system that must be
treated at the wastewater treatment plants. Sewer relining or replacement
may be necessary, or engineers may divert the flow or seal the catch basins.

2014-2018 Capital Improvement Plan
As shown in Figure CIP-11, the Sanitary Engineer’s capital improvements are
categorized into two project categories: maintenance and rehabilita on and
reconstruc on.

revenues generated through these annual charges must support both on going
opera ons and capital improvements.
In the past, annual revenues funded a limited number of capital improvements
requested by the Sanitary Engineer. Presently, cash balances exist within various sewer districts that can be used to finance planned capital improvements
while annual revenues fund the opera ng budget, debt service and emergency
capital repairs.

Rehabilitation/Reconstruction
Rehabilita on or reconstruc on within the districts, at $39.1 million over the
five year plan accounts for 83.4% of the project costs. The largest of grouping
of these projects include the sewer relining in various loca ons for $15.0 million or 38.4% of total rehabilita on and reconstruc on costs.

Maintenance
The Sanitary Engineer has $7.8 million in the capital plan for maintenance on
sanitary sewer systems. This es mate is 16.6% of the projects expenditures.
Approximately 22.6% of this category is $2.7 million which is budgeted for
engineering projects in various communi es. Two emergency repair projects
in various communi es totaling $2.0 million comprise 25.6% of maintenance
costs. The remainder of the projected capital costs is for pump sta on elimina on and sewer repair costs that occur on an ongoing basis.
Funding Sources
The major source of opera ng and capital funds for the Sanitary Engineer has
been user fees or special assessments charged to users within the service districts. According to the Ohio Revised Code, these resources must fund ac vies in the districts that generate the resources. As an Enterprise Fund, the

Capital Plan
Sanitary Engineer
Because the Sanitary Engineer is an enterprise fund and charges users for both
opera onal and capital needs, the Sanitary Engineer holds a substan al cash
balance which has built up over the past three years. Cash reserves totaled
$36.1 million at the end of 2013. These cash reserves are needed in case an
event such as a pump sta on replacement occurs which the Sanitary Engineer
did not forecast. The engineer has also rebated customers where excess cash
occurs.
The Sanitary Engineer has implemented a new revenue source for projects that
expand the user base through development. A protec on charge was developed for water main projects since the County General Fund was expected
to advance a por on of the project cost. While users who ini ally access the
new water main will pay a tap in fee, the County is concerned that users who
wait a number of years to connect will not pay their fair share of project costs.
Thus, a protec on charge has been developed to charge future users actual
costs plus interest based on their me of connec on. The protec on charge
will eliminate any basis for wai ng to connect, and reimburse the County for
advancing these costs.
The Sanitary Engineer has been able to complete a number of projects since
1989 with State of Ohio Issue I (formerly Issue II) Program Funds. Issue 1 funds
are administered by the Ohio Public Works Commission. State of Ohio Issue
I Funds, o en providing 90% funding, has enabled the County to meet capital requests for sewer infrastructure without immediately deple ng local resources. However, a much smaller amount of Issue I funds have been granted
more recently, and there is no guarantee that projects will be approved in the
compe ve Issue I process. The Sanitary Engineer has been awarded loans
(0% interest payable over 20 years) rather than grants, which impact future
resource levels. Another factor is that while 90% funding is available for maintenance and rehabilita on projects, new construc on projects are only eligible
for funding at the 50% level. No Issue I projects are planned during this five
year capital planning period.

Other State funding sources include loans made from State development en es including the Ohio Water Development Authority, a division of the Ohio
Environmental Protec on Agency (EPA) and the Ohio Public Works Commission. The Ohio EPA provides low interest loans to eligible communi es for sewer projects. The County has entered into 19 loan agreements with the Ohio
EPA totaling $12.9 million.
The Sanitary Engineer has also u lized no interest loans made available from
the Ohio Public Works Commission. There are currently four such loans outstanding that were made to finance various sewer maintenance projects. The
loans bear no interest and the last maturity is in 2019. Revenue from the sanitary sewer user charges are being used to pay back the loans.
The capital financing plan for the Sanitary Engineer will require new funding
sources in order to meet an cipated needs. A poten al op on under review
by County staﬀ is long term debt financing. The Sanitary Engineer cannot fund
all projects with current revenues, but could aﬀord payment over the long
term based on actual project benefits. Larger mul -year expansion and new
construc on projects that have significant costs associated are considered for
long term debt financing.
Four debt financing op ons exist for the County. These include General Obligaon (GO) Bonds, (GO) Special Assessment Bonds, GO Self Suppor ng Bonds,
and Revenue Bonds. Both GO Self-Suppor ng Bonds and Revenue Bonds issued for Sanitary Engineering projects would be re red with user fees. Revenue Bonds must meet strict debt service coverage requirements with annual
revenues. While preferable for debt limita on purposes, it would be diﬃcult
for the Sanitary Engineer to meet these requirements.
The County currently holds has outstanding Sewer Improvement Bonds totaling $5.1 million for various sewer improvement projects. The County issued
$1.04 million in GO Special Assessment Bonds for Sewer projects in September
2000 for the Chagrin Highlands Sanitary Sewer Project. This Project ini ally
was financed with one-year notes that had been rolled over at the end of each
term. The current 2000 Series Bond will mature in 2020. The remaining

VIII-28

Capital Plan
Sanitary Engineer
Sewer Improvement Project debt was refinanced in 2003 and the exis ng debt
issues were replaced with General Obliga on Sewer Improvement Refunding
Bonds or Capital Improvement Notes. The $2.36 million Solon / Orange Sewer
Project Bond originally issued in 1992 was refunded and replaced with a $1.5
million GO Sewer Improvement Refunding Bond with a 2013 maturity. Sewer
projects originally funded by bond an cipa on notes for Orange Place Extension $2,440,000, Chagrin Falls Township Waterline $222,000, Olmsted Township Waterline $860,000 and Sharp Road $237,000 projects were converted to
General Obliga on Bonds as part of the 2004 Capital Improvement. In 2005,
a $4.4 million bond was issued in order to convert exis ng Sewer BAN’s to a
twenty-year bond. These original notes issued in 2000 were to fund the construc on of water and sewer lines in Olmsted Township (Schady Road). All of
the debt service for these bonds is paid with special assessments levied on the
property owners that u lize the sewer improvements.
There are currently no plans to issue addi onal GO Debt to fund sewer projects
outlined in the 2014-2018 CIP.
Operating Impact
The Sanitary Engineer’s Capital Improvement Program has an impact on the
annual opera ng budget. There is a posi ve eﬀect on opera ng costs when
sewer lines and pump sta ons are rehabilitated or replaced. This reduces
maintenance costs, as well as the amount of wastewater requiring treatment
at wastewater facili es through reduced inflow/infiltra on to the system.
Maintenance projects, notably the Telemonitoring Project, also reduce costs
as pump sta ons are monitored oﬀ site with minimum staﬃng/over me.

Conversely, opera ng costs increase through two diﬀerent ac vi es that the
Sanitary Engineer has ini ated. First, expansion projects increase opera ng
costs as addi onal lines and pump sta ons are added to the system. While
opera ng costs will increase, these new areas may not impose an addi onal
burden since costs can be recovered from new users serviced by the improvement. A similar scenario will occur as more wastewater flows through the
system and treatment costs increase.
Second, the preventa ve maintenance program represents short-term costs to
achieve long-term savings. While this work will save dollars as sewer lines are
inspected and maintained over the long run, staﬀ and equipment are necessary to operate this program. At least 18 heavy equipment units are involved
and two to four staﬀ operates each unit. Personnel costs for the approximately
61 maintenance staﬀ annually exceed $3.6 million. Should the County expand
the system through new construc on projects, addi onal costs will be incurred
as this program expands to cover new lines. Higher costs may be par ally
oﬀset by increased produc vity with any expansion as well as the proposed
elimina on of wastewater treatment plants and pump sta ons included in the
2014-2018 Capital Improvement Plan.
A final considera on for the opera ng impact is future debt issuance to fund
capital improvements. This ac on will require debt service payments through
current revenues and future rate increases. In either case the opera ng budget
is aﬀected and the County must be careful to minimize the Sanitary Engineer’s
debt burden; if a large percentage of annual revenues are required for debt
service, there may not be enough funds to meet opera ng needs. When the
County issues debt for Sanitary Engineering projects, policy guidelines should
be considered so that debt service payments do not exceed a specific percentage of annual revenues and/or expenditures.

2013 Capital Project Highlights
The inclusion of informa on systems in the CIP has been driven by a refinement
of the informa on technology planning process over the past year. In 2013,
IT installed over 3,000 new computers (desktops and laptops). Also in 2013,
IT installed a centralized camera management system for protec ve services.
Finally, the department installed 6 self-scan Kiosks at neighborhood centers.
In 2014 to 2018, IT plans on spending $47.8 million in new projects including
equipment and systems that are used or deployed across the en ty and are replaced based on a schedule developed to spread the cost out over the planning
horizon. The larger equipment and enterprise systems will compete for debt
or other financing while smaller components unrelated to project implementaons will use current resources including General Fund cash reserve.

InformaƟon Systems & Technology
 TelecommunicaƟons - the CIP includes $1.9 million to replace equipment
used to support the County’s Wide area network and Voice over Internet
Protocol phone system and mobile telephone devices. Funding will be
used to replace aging network routers, voice equipment and video conferencing servers.

2014-2018 Capital Improvement Plan
IT capital projects typically fall into two broad categories; equipment
and upgrades ($8.9 million), and informa on technology ($38.8 million).
Equipment projects entail the replacement of servers, personal compu ng
devices telecommunica ons equipment. The equipment in this category will
o en have a useful life in the five to seven year range but are s ll eligible for
debt financing. Equipment is procured over the five year plan based on a
replacement schedule. All equipment acquired is carried in the County’s fixed
asset system.
The informa on systems category of the CIP includes major investments in
County-wide informa on systems that are used to eﬀectuate the comple on
of ongoing opera ons. This category is a unique addi on to the County CIP
in that it can include the costs of developing and implemen ng informa on
systems as well as related equipment costs. The useful life can exceed ten
years and debt financing is a poten al source of funding.
Equipment and Upgrades
Capital expenditures on equipment and upgrades comprise the 18.7% of the
CIP for Informa on Technology. This category has three areas of investment:
 CompuƟng Equipment - the CIP has iden fied $4.9 million in compu ng
equipment upgrades. The majority of the investment is to replace
personal computers, tablets, iPads and accessories that are deployed at
the agency level for employee use.

Information Systems
Capital expenditures on informa on systems comprise the majority of the IT
plan at 81.3%. A significant por on of this category is devoted towards funding
the mul -year implementa on of a major enterprise system. This enterprise
system will unify and replace the various financial and management systems
with an enterprise resource planning solu on (ERP). The capital plan es mates
the majority of the expenditures will occur in 2014 and 2015 and will total
$20.0 million. The project es mate includes equipment, development, installa on and implementa on costs.
The County has not included development and implementa on of enterprise
systems in prior capital improvements plans. The inclusion of major
informa on systems projects in the CIP add addi onal scope to the County’s
overall investment in capital assets and lends to more strategic approach to
opera ons. The systems that are planned will rely on some form of long term
financing that will require a share of ongoing opera ng capacity to fund.

 Enterprise Servers - the CIP includes $1.3 million designated for replacement of larger server type devices that are used to house data and informa on system applica ons. The rapid evolu on of applica on hos ng
and standards for using servers will impact the la er years of the capital
plan. These changes will most likely reduce the amount of servers need
to support informa on systems.

InformaƟon Systems & Technology
Funding Sources

Operating Impact

The County has iden fied two sources to fund IT capital projects. The variety of
equipment and project scope will require a diverse and crea ve mix of funding.

Although Cuyahoga County’s capital plan is a management tool primarily used
to set priori es and metables, the impact on the opera ng budget must
be considered during the decision making process. Informa on technology
projects have opera ng costs that have to be considered when budge ng. The
implementa on of systems will have opera ng impacts related to addi onal
support costs, upgrades and employee training. These opera ng factors will
impact IT and user agencies. Opera ng impacts will be incorporated into the
user charges used to charge County agencies for shared informa on services.
The addi onal opera ng costs will have oﬀsets in the form of more eﬃcient
business processes and unified replacement of equipment. It is diﬃcult to
quan fy how these two types of impacts will manifest in the opera ng budget
but the planning for the major systems will include this evalua on.

The largest source of funding at $47.4 million iden fied in the plan is bond
proceeds. The plan envisions the use of either debt issuance or other financing
to implement the ERP system and to fund various equipment costs. Addi onal
planning is being completed to determine what por on of the informa on
system installa ons can be bonded out or u lize alterna ve financing methods.
Op ons such as technology or leasing may be applicable to the ERP and related
equipment.
The second source of funding is the General Fund ($374,000). At the me of
the CIP, the County had earmarked most of the funding from debt service. The
County is reluctant to fund IT projects from the General Fund.

Building Improvements
Cuyahoga County provides a variety of mandated func ons and programs for its
ci zens concerning human services, jus ce, public safety and general government. The County maintains facili es where employees provide services to the
public, administer daily func ons, and store records.
The responsibility for general facili es maintenance resides with the Department of Public Works – Facili es Division. This department provides custodial,
security and trades staﬀ for County owned buildings and is responsible for capital project planning du es. This department, working with County agencies and
the Oﬃce of Budget and Management (OBM), prepares capital plans, designs
individual projects, and oversees construc on.

The current inventory of Buildings owned by the County includes 11 districts
with a total of 47 facili es (see Chart: Buildings Owned by the County County).
The total gross space is 4.5 million square feet while the total of County leased
space is 700,000 square feet. Since the average facility was built in 1946, major
improvements both internally and externally are necessary. The County sold
the Ameritrust building for $27 million in 2013 and is funding the construc on
of a new County Headquarters to be opened in July 2014. Most recently, the
County has finished construc on of the Global Center for Health Innova on/
Cleveland Conven on Center, a $465 million project that was funded by project specific bond oﬀerings.
2013 Capital Project Highlights

Assignment of project financing for these projects resides with OBM. To keep
up with increasing facility needs, a number of revenue sources have been used.
Two major funding sources have been the General Fund for projects generally
under $300,000 and debt financing for projects that can be in excess of a million
dollars.
Inventory of County Owned Facilities
The Department of Public Works, as stated above, is responsible for acquisi on,
maintenance and repair of County facili es. Buildings and land are leased (the
County maintains 30 leases) or purchased by the Real Estate Division. A staﬀ
of 121 custodians and maintenance workers, and 93 trades staﬀ to maintain
County facili es. Special project staﬃng from temporary hires that had once
been dedicated to comple ng capital projects are no longer used. Long range
planning of acquisi ons, maintenance, and repair flow through the Department
of Public Works – Facili es Division, with the assistance of OBM and the County
Fiscal Oﬃcer.
The Department of Public Works conducts an annual inventory of County facilies and reviews requests submi ed through the budget process to decide future capital improvements. A high level review of the proposed improvements
and funding sources is completed by OBM. The decision to assign priori es to
specific projects and building categories rests with the County Execu ve.

Most of the capital projects presented in the previous two capital plans have
been completed or are nearing comple on. The majority of these projects
had been funded with proceeds from General Obliga on debt that was issued
in late 2012. There are currently over 11 ac ve capital projects at various
loca ons for maintenance of exis ng buildings and equipment. These projects
have been funded primarily from proceeds from the 2012 bond issue.
Capital projects for numerous smaller scale projects have been submi ed as
part of the annual CIP process since the last general obliga on bond issue in
late 2012. Various improvement projects are funded with General Fund dollars and are comprised of projects usually under $300,000. There are currently
$7.6 million of ac ve General Fund capital projects in the 2014 CIP for smaller
maintenance and equipment replacement projects in various County buildings. These projects include replacement of HVAC systems, ligh ng, and other
improvements at various county loca ons.
The County Jus ce Center includes the Courts Tower building and two separate jail facili es that contain over 1.2 million square feet of space that require
ongoing capital improvements. There are currently $50.7 million of budgeted
expenditures for a variety of improvements to the Jail and Jus ce Tower buildings including upgrades to building control systems and the building exterior.
The major project underway is the renova on of the main Jail I kitchen with a

budget of $7.9 million and an cipated expenditures of $3.3 million le in 2014.
This project is funded with proceeds from the 2009 and 2012 bond issues.
Work was completed on the largest capital improvement undertaken by the
County in some me. The Juvenile Jus ce Center project ($193 million) located in Cleveland’s Fairfax neighborhood was completed in the spring of 2011
and opened in October of 2011. The 650,000 square foot complex includes a
180 bed youth deten on center and an administra ve complex that contains
courtrooms and administra ve oﬃces.
Originally, the County planned to consolidate oﬃce space for approximately
1,300 employees of various agencies into a centralized administra on building by purchasing the Ameritrust complex site on Euclid Avenue in the City of
Cleveland. The County sold the Ameritrust Building for $27 million in 2013. At
the me of the sale the County had invested $40.0 million in the building. The
County is inves ga ng mul ple ways to fund this nega ve project balance.
The County engaged a real estate consultant to review the current por olio of
owned proper es to recommend a strategy for the future in light of the construc on and move of County employees into the new County headquarters.
The County has begun selling exis ng proper es and will be termina ng leases
on other proper es as a result of the move into the new County Headquarters.
To date, the County has sold eight buildings and is ac vely marke ng four more
building for sale. In August, a er the move is complete, the county will be termina ng leases on four other buildings.
2014-2018 Capital Improvement Plan
The fiscal health of the region over the past several years makes the process of
comple ng a capital plan diﬃcult. Every organiza on requires a plan to make
the most eﬃcient use of limited resources. Central Services provides OBM
with a list of capital projects under considera on. OBM confirms these project
plan es mates into five-year plan model along with iden fied funding sources.

Capital Projects typically fall into six categories: maintenance, rehabilita on/
reconstruc on, expansion/new construc on, health and safety, renova on,
and energy management. The projects and their corresponding category and
funding source are detailed in Figure CIP-15. The projects included a focus on
upgrading key loca ons and preserving the health and safety of exis ng infrastructure. In 2014, the County will begin building a new Conven on Center
Hotel budgeted in the CIP at $266.0 million. In addi on, the County will spend
$26.4 million in tenant improvement and moving costs for the new County
Headquarters Building. The County is also inves ng $17.4 million in a new
IT data center in an exis ng County-owned building. Finally, other significant
projects undertaken by the County will be maintenance projects: Countywide
Pain ng, carpe ng and minor building improvement. These projects total
$15.0 million over five years and will be funded by the General Fund.
Central Services has iden fied a variety of projects that will require funding
through future debt issuance. Without funding these projects must be priorized over the next several years for possible comple on. These decisions will
require significant investment in capital dollars in the Conven on Center Hotel,
Jus ce Center and other buildings the County elects to maintain in the future.
These costs are es mated in Figure CIP-15.
Funding Sources
The County considers several sources to fund capital projects. Most building
improvement projects will be funded with either General Fund dollars or proceeds from the sale of general obliga on bonds. Since the County exceeds the
10-millage requirement to issue General Obliga on debt, the County will be
issuing revenue bonds in 2015. Other sources include federal, State, and local
dollars, bond interest earnings and, in some cases, non General Fund revenues.
Unvoted debt represents bonds/notes issued at the discre on of the County
without voter approval. In December, 2012 the County issued $66.0 million in
new money bonds to fund project needs from preceding three years. Among
the list of projects were the Juvenile Jus ce Complex Phase II ($49.5 M), Jail
I Kitchen renova on ($4.0M), Energy Conserva on Improvements ($2.8M),

VIII-36

Capital Plan
Building Improvements
Hun ngton Garage Improvements ($1.2M), installa on of the Sheriﬀ ’s 800
Mhz radio system ($1.2M), Jus ce Center Rehab of 120 booking and central
processing center ($1.1 MM) and Juvenile Jus ce Center Build Out – Public
Defender ($1.0M). Four other projects totaling $3.1 million were also included
in the 2012 GO financing.
Voted debt represents bonds/notes placed on the ballot and approved by the
voters. There are no plans to u lize voted debt in the current Capital Improvements Plan.
State dollars were u lized through the Clean Ohio Fund to prepare the Juvenile
Jus ce Complex site. The state funding of $3 million was applied to the $12
million cost of the cleanup of the site. The County also received a $3 million
Clean Ohio grant that was applied to the cost of removing asbestos from the
Ameritrust building site.
The Other sources funding category represents various sources such as parking revenues, prior year bond interest earnings and financing of energy related
projects using House Bill 300. Enterprise fund revenues from Hun ngton Park
Garage will fund renova on projects or contribute to debt service on a pro rata
basis. Interest earnings from the 2012 bond proceeds totaled $45,000. Interest earned on idle bond proceeds is used to oﬀset bond funded project costs.
In 1994, the Ohio Legislature approved House Bill 300 for County energy projects. This bill allows coun es to contract with energy vendors to implement
energy savings projects. The vendors guarantee the energy savings as part of
their agreements, and these savings are used to pay oﬀ bonds issued to finance projects. It is a crea ve way to fund energy saving projects, and puts
the burden on vendors to document and guarantee savings. The last payment
on the purchase installment agreement is in 2011. The majority of the savings
a ributable to the HB300 investments were in the Jus ce Center.

Justice Projects
The County is involved in a variety of capital projects regarding the Jus ce System. Most of the projects involve maintenance of exis ng infrastructure. The
County Jus ce Center includes a 750,000 square foot tower that houses County and City courts and other jus ce related func ons. The building is an aging
facility that will require over $100 million in improvements over the next 12
years if it is to remain a viable hub for Jus ce ac vi es in downtown Cleveland.
The County has had to dedicate resources to the aging Jus ce Center in each
year’s allotment of capital dollars. The current CIP includes $40.0 million of expenditures over the next five years to fund capital improvements at the Jus ce
Center resul ng from the recommenda on of the consultant’s study. Some
rehabilita on/safety improvements projects in the Jus ce System include the
complete renova on of the Jail I 5th floor Kitchen ($7.4 million) which was
started in 2010. Other major projects at the Jus ce Center include the funding
of a Jus ce Center consultant study ($2.0 million), the refurbishment of the
booking sta on in the Jus ce Center ($200,000) and the renova on of the third
floor booking and holding area ($1.1 million).
The CIP includes build out of an emergency opera ons center within the existing Juvenile Jus ce Center. The Oﬃce of Emergency Management is dedicated
to building a state-of-the-art Emergency Opera ons Center (EOC) for use by all
of Cuyahoga County. The $1.5 million project is a required piece of the County’s regional emergency management plan and is guided by specific rules set
forth by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Funding has tenta vely
been iden fied as bond proceeds but other sources including 9 1 1 wireless
surcharge revenue will be considered as a poten al funding source.
In 2008, the County received a grant in the amount of $10.8 million from the
State Department of Rehabilita on and Correc ons to construct a Community
Based Correc onal Facility (CBCF). CBCF’s are residen al sanc oned facili es
that provide County Courts of Common Pleas a sentencing alterna ve to prison. The County’s new facility is operated by an outside en ty with the State of
Ohio providing an annual opera ng subsidy for the County’s internal cost of

administering the facility. A CBCF Governing Board was created at the County
to oversee the design, si ng and construc on of the new facility. The County
selected a contractor and construc on of the facility was completed on me
and under the allo ed budget in late 2010. The oﬃcial opening of the facility
was on January 30, 2011. The facility opera on is funded with an annual opera ng grant from the Ohio Department of Rehabilita on and Correc ons.

was $465 million. In late 2013, the County replaced its partner in the project,
MMPI (Merchandise Mart Proper es, Inc.), with another partner SMG to operate the buildings. The County also set up a non-profit company to disburse
opera ng payments to SMG.

Energy Projects

Included in the CIP, is $266 million earmarked for the construc on of a new
conven on center hotel. The hotel will be constructed next to the Cleveland
Conven on and the Global Center for Health Innova on and will eventually be
connected to the conven on center. The new hotel will include 600 rooms and
will be 27 stories in height. The hotel will be operated by Hilton Hotels, Inc.
and will be constructed by Turner Construc on Co.

Budgeted u lity costs for 2014 are $8.7 million. U lity costs con nue to increase, crea ng a higher necessity and demand for energy use reduc on and
“greener” sources of energy. Construc on of new County buildings such as the
County Headquarters Building and the Juvenile Jus ce Complex brings with it
the opportunity to implement these ideas. The current objec ve of these projects is to implement environmental friendly renova on or construc on, as well
as crea ng an energy eﬃcient space.
The County has undertaken several energy conserva on ini a ves to be implemented over the next few years. Under House Bill 300, the County has
contracts with vendors to study facility energy use, and iden fy and quan fy
energy conserva on measures to be conducted. Energy conserva on measures may include: insula on of the building structure and systems within the
building, windows and doors, automa c energy control systems, replacement
or modifica ons to HVAC systems, caulking and weather-stripping, energy efficient ligh ng, and co-genera on systems. As part of the County’s energy conserva on program, the County has joined the EPA Green Lights and Energy Star
Buildings programs. County use of energy-eﬃcient ligh ng is proving to be
both profitable and environmentally responsible.
The Global Center for Health Innova on / Cleveland Conven on Center Project
The County completed the construc on in July 2013, and, through its partner
SMG, has begun opera ng the Global Center for Health Innova on / Cleveland
Conven on Center (formerly the Medical Mart and Conven on Center). The
project came in on me and under budget. The es mated cost of the facility

New County Headquarters
The County sold the former Ameritrust proper es to GEIS, Inc. for $27 million
in a transac on which involves GEIS overseeing the construc on of a new
County Headquarters at the corner of East 9th and Prospect in Cleveland, Ohio.
The Cuyahoga County Port Authority issued $75,465,000 in bonds to build the
new headquarters and will func on as the landlord for the building. GEIS will
develop and manage the new headquarters for 27 years. The County will pay
base rent to the Port Authority to cover the debt service on the bonds and will
pay service rent to GEIS to manage the property. Base rent will commence
in 2016 and will start at $4,007,100 per year and will increase 2% each year
for 25 years. Service rent
will commence in July
2014 and will start at
$1,767,120 and increase
2% per year. At the end
of the management
agreement, the County
can purchase the new
headquarters for $1.00.
The purpose of the

VIII-38

Capital Plan
Building Improvements
County Headquarters is to consolidate personnel from several buildings in the

the process of selling 4 more buildings. The County will terminate the leases
on three buildings a er the move takes place. Approximately 700 County
employees are expected to move into the new County Headquarters in July,

expended in 2014 for the New Headquarters.

Re rement Fund.
The Global Center for Health Innova on / Cleveland Conven on Center was
opened in the summer 2013. The 945,000 square foot complex replaced the
aging conven on center and resulted in the construc on of a new building,
the Global Center for Health Innova on. The opera ng impact of the Global
Center totals $9.1 million per year.

Operating Impact
Although Cuyahoga County’s capital plan is a management tool primarily used
to set priori es and metables, the impact on the opera ng budget must be
considered during the decision making process. These considera ons include
funding sources, the impact of new facili es and project management.
To minimize local funding needs, the County has applied for State funding on
large dollar projects. Significant funding has been received for a number of
projects, including the Clean Ohio Fund grant from the State for the Juvenile
Jus ce Complex site mi ga on. These funds allow the County to complete necessary projects and save local revenues for projects with no outside assistance.
The County is considering use of financing op ons other than debt and state
money to fund the new Administra on Building plan. Any redevelopment and
lease revenues generated from this plan would be used for project costs. The
County will con nue to seek outside funds in the future to leverage addi onal
capital dollars. There is a clear General Fund impact through issuance of unvoted debt. A por on of property taxes, otherwise levied for General Fund op-

The County con nually makes an assessment of the cumula ve expenses related to capital project spending. Every three years on average the County
will aggregate bondable project costs that have accumulated and issue General
Obliga on Bonds to finance the improvements. The debt service payments attributable to the bonds are an opera ng expense paid out of the County Debt
Service Fund. A various improvements debt issue was completed in December
of 2012 to finance various capital improvements and other large projects including the Juvenile Jus ce Complex, Phase II. The $66.0 million new money
bond issue has annualized debt service of approximately $6.5 million in 2014.
The Capital Project fund currently has a cash deficit of $20.1 million. The main
components of the cash deficit are related to the Ameritrust Building and capital projects that have commenced since the last bond issue in 2012.

Debt Management
Financing long-term capital improvements o en requires the issuance
of debt. Depending upon the type of capital improvement, various
debt instruments are available to the County. As stated previously, the
County’s financial policies dictate a balanced approach to financing
capital improvements, one that considers capital improvement financing
in terms of the County’s capacity to pay for that debt and maintain its
long-term financial strength.

The Debt Management sec on lists the County’s debt policies and
debt indicators, discusses the types of debt the County issues and the
amounts outstanding, explains the voted and unvoted debt limita ons,
and comments on the County’s credit ra ng history. For proposed debt
issues of the County and their impact on opera ons, refer to the Capital
Improvements Plan sec on.

Debt Management
In addi on to Debt Policies, there are certain Debt Indicators that the
County uses to compare the size and burden of our outstanding debt
to that of other coun es. The Debt Indicators provided in Table DM1
include all outstanding general obliga on debt issued by the County as
of January 31, 2014 and are summarized below.

net debt refers to the net debt incurred directly by Cuyahoga County.
Overall net debt includes the net debt of overlapping subdivisions
appor oned in accordance with property valua on. The County’s direct
debt per capita is $252. Cuyahoga County’s per capita debt measures
are low compared to the median indicators from other Ohio coun es.
The variance is par ally due to the variability in how other government
units determine overall and net debt outstanding.

Size Per Capita

Debt Burden

The rela ve size of debt is computed by dividing either direct net debt or
overall net debt by popula on to arrive at net debt per capita. Net debt
is defined as a governmental unit’s gross debt less bonds fully supported
from enterprise revenues, and less short-term opera ng debt. Direct

The rela ve burden of debt is computed by dividing either direct net
debt or overall net debt by the es mated full value of taxable property
to arrive at a ra o of measurement. The es mated full value of taxable
property (E.F.V.) refers to the “true” or “fair” market value of all taxable
property within the boundaries of Cuyahoga County. The es mated full
value serves as a measure of the County’s wealth and is reflec ve of its
capacity to service debt. The county has a direct net burden (0.40%) that
is lower than the median for comparable coun es (See Net Direct Debt
Burden, Figure DM1). Overall net debt burden (3.02%) is comparably
lower though and is likely to increase as the County issues addi onal
debt to meet its an cipated capital needs. These an cipated needs are
discussed in a subsequent sec on of Debt Management.

There are other common measurements that aid in the analysis of
outstanding debt. One is the percent of principal that will be re red over
the next ten-year period. The accepted norm is 60%. A debt program
which follows this guideline will create addi onal borrowing capacity
sooner as opposed to delaying or back-end loading the re rement of
principal. The County’s ten year bonded debt is at 54.6% in 2014 is
higher than Ohio Aaa county median of 46.0%. Another measurement
used in credit analysis is annual debt service as a percent of opera ng
revenue, or expenditures. A low ra o indicates that debt service is

General ObligaƟon Debt

OutstandingGeneralObligationDebt
($millions)

Historically, the County has u lized general obliga on debt to finance
capital improvements. The County currently has two categories of
general obliga on debt against which it pays debt service (principal
and interest costs) each year: unvoted general obliga on bonds and
self-suppor ng bonds. Figure DM-2 shows the distribu on of current
outstanding debt by these three categories.

SelfSupporting
$1.3
0.4%

Approximately 99.6% of outstanding debt represented in figure DM2 is
from the unvoted debt source. This debt is authorized by the County
without a voted authoriza on. State law establishes limits on the
amount of unvoted debt that can be incurred. The revenue to pay this
debt comes from general property tax collec ons that would otherwise
go to the County’s General Fund for day-to-day opera ng costs. In total,
$314.25 million of this type of debt is outstanding as of January 1, 2014.

UnvotedDebt

placing less strain on the opera ng capability of the governmental en ty.
The County expects to have a debt to expenditure ra o of about 10.2%
percent in 2014 which is slightly lower than the actual 11.5% in 2012
and lower than the Ohio median of 18.8%. This measure decreased with
the re rement of voted general obliga on debt in 2013 which reduced
annual debt service by $6.7 million to the County opera ng budget.
Debt service remains rela vely constant while the opera ng budget has
increased since 2012 to accommodate the transfer of project sources
to the Global Center for Health Innova on (formerly Medical Mart)
opera ng account (see Global Center) and the establishment of a new
County headquarters.
Figure DM-1 illustrates the debt Indicators that have been discussed
above.

IX-3

The last issuance from the County was a $111.3 million of general
obliga on bonds issued in December of 2012. These bonds were issued
to advance refund 2004 limited tax G.O. bonds maturing in 2015 –
2024, inclusive, and to advance refund the Village of Highland Hills G.O.
bonds in order to free-up debt capacity within the ten-mill indirect debt
limita on plus $64 million for various new capital projects. All of the
outstanding general obliga on debt is fixed rate. The County does not
plan to issue new general obliga on debt in 2014 or 2015. See Future
Financings sec on.
Voted General ObligaƟon Bonds

As of year-end 2013, approximately no current outstanding debt came
from debt authorized by the ci zens of the County through the vo ng
process. Tax collec ons for the County’s General Fund are not aﬀected

This debt is authorized by the County without a vote of the ci zens and
is generally issued to finance water/sewer infrastructure projects in
surrounding communi es. This category now includes the bonds and
notes issued by the County to support the construc on and renova on
of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum as the debt service is
now fully reimbursed by a dedicated revenue source. At the beginning
of 2014, $12.4 million is outstanding in the self-suppor ng category,
reflec ng 1.7% of total outstanding debt. All of the debt issues
men oned in this paragraph are exempt from the direct debt limita on.
There are currently no plans to include any County sewer projects in
next debt issue.

Debt service for unvoted sewer bonds is not funded by property tax
collec ons, but rather, revenue derived from an improvement or its
opera on from tap-in charges, sewer rates or special assessments levied
on property owners benefi ng from the improvements.
The total outstanding self suppor ng debt is comprised:

General obliga on bonds are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the
County. This means the debt is backed by the County’s ability to levy
taxes to support the debt. In the case of unvoted debt, the revenue to
pay this debt comes from general property tax collec ons which would
otherwise go to the County’s General Fund for day-to-day opera ng
costs. General property taxes are an important source of revenue for
the General Fund, so an appropriate balance between financing debt
and current opera ons is vital.
The unvoted property tax millage that may be levied by the County
may not exceed $1.45 per thousand dollars of property valua on, or
1.45 mills. Figure DM-3 shows how the County has balanced the use
of the property tax millage for on-going opera ons versus capital
improvements. The trend over the past ten years has been an increase
of inside millage directed to pay debt service on general obliga on

bonds. In 2014, unvoted millage equaling .85 mills will be levied ($25.4
million) to the Debt Re rement Fund to service unvoted debt, leaving
.60 mills to be used for General Fund opera ons ($13.9 million). The
shi in millage to service unvoted debt service started in 2011 when
excess cash reserves accrued since 2008 were finally used up in 2011.
The balance between debt and opera ng millage has exhibited erosion
on opera ng capacity over the past ten years. This decline in available
opera ng dollars is correlated with the increase in unvoted debt burden
as well as a decrease in property valua on. The increase in annual
debt service requires the County to devote a larger share of unvoted
property taxes (which are also shrinking) to fund the required annual
debt payments. Debt payments in 2014 are es mated at $25.4 million.
Debt LimitaƟons

The State of Ohio imposes limita ons on the types and amounts of debt
that can be issued by the County. The Ohio Revised Code establishes
two types of limita ons, direct and indirect debt limita ons.
Unvoted Debt

Sec on 133.07 of the Ohio Revised Code provides that the net general
obliga on indebtedness of the County issued without a vote of the
electors shall never exceed one percent of the value of all property
within the territorial boundaries of the County as listed and assessed for
valua on. County debt that is exempt from this limita on includes the
County’s self-suppor ng sewer bonds ($3.5 million) and Rock & Roll Hall
of Fame debt ($8.9 million).

update to assessed value compiled by the County Auditor for 2010
collec on. The six year reappraisal completed in 2012 resulted in s ll
lower assessed property values. Further decreases in the valua on
will decrease the debt limit of the County substan ally. Figure DM4
reflects the $221.2 million of unvoted non-exempt debt iden fied as
outstanding, allowing a maximum amount of $55.8 million in addi onal
unvoted debt to be issued.
Voted and Unvoted Debt

The Ohio Revised Code further provides that the total voted and unvoted
debt of the County, less debt exempt from the limita on, may not exceed
(1) the sum of three percent of the first one hundred million dollars of
the tax list of the County, plus (2) one and one-half percent of the tax list
between one hundred and three hundred million dollars, plus (3) two
and one-half percent of the tax list in excess of three hundred million
dollars. As of January 1, 2014, this limita on equates to approximately
$690.9 million in debt that can be outstanding. With total non-exempt
voted and unvoted debt outstanding currently equal to $230.1 million,
an addi onal $468.3 million in voted and unvoted debt could be issued.
(See Figure DM-4)
Indirect Debt LimitaƟon - Unvoted

Debt that is exempt from other debt limita on computa ons is not
exempt when considering the indirect limita on on unvoted debt.
Unvoted general obliga on bonds and notes cannot be issued by the
County unless the ad valorem property tax that might be required
for payment of the debt service is ten mills (one percent) or less per
As Figure DM-4 shows, one percent of assessed valua on equates to $1.00 of assessed valua on of the combina on of overlapping taxing

has been in decline as County property values were lowered a er the
IX-6

Debt Management
This ten-mill limita on therefore is dependent upon what occurs in
the other overlapping taxing subdivisions. A rela vely small issue by
another overlapping taxing subdivision with a small assessed valua on
can encumber a significant amount of millage, thereby drama cally
reducing the amount of unvoted general obliga on debt that could be
issued by the County. At this me, the City of Bedford places the greatest
limita on on the County as an overlapping subdivision at 8.98 mills. The
capacity of the overlapping millage has contracted a great deal in the
past two years due to increased issuance by the County’s over-lappers
and the decline in assessed property valua on. As of the first quarter of

The County will have to u lize alterna ve methods of financing including
the use of Unvoted Sales Tax Revenue bonds in order to meet planned
long term financing needs in the interim. Financing methods such as
sales tax revenue bonds would provide a source secondary source of
unvoted debt to meet long term financing needs. Alterna ve financing
could come with higher interest and issuance costs in comparison to
tradi onal general obliga on bonds.
Current Outstanding General ObligaƟon Debt

The County last issued Sewer Improvement Bonds in 2005. This $4.445
million bond was issued in order to convert exis ng Sewer BANs to a
twenty year bond. The original notes had been issued in 2000 to fund
the construc on of water and sewer lines in Olmsted Township (Schady
Road). The BANs were “rolled” each year un l the project costs were
finalized and special assessments had been authorized by the County
and the Township. The sale of the bonds was completed using an
online compe ve bid process. The County was able to save on costs
of issuance by using a compe ve sale for these bonds. There are no
plans to issue addi onal sewer debt.
The County completed a $111.3 million issue of GO debt in December of
2012. The proceeds totaling $111.3 million including the sale premium
were used to advance refund limited tax general obliga on bonds ,

As of January 1, 2014 the County has a total of $314.2 million in

County’s capacity to issue debt for capital improvements. (See Figure
DM-5). The twenty year outlook for debt service includes all outstanding
voted and unvoted general obliga on debt. 2014 is currently the
year with the highest level of debt service at $38.1 million. Layering

Credit RaƟng

When the County an cipates issuing debt, an assessment is made of
the condi on of the County by independent credit ra ng agencies. The
credit agencies consider the County’s financial health and debt situa on,
the economic condi on of the area and the County’s management of its
resources as factors in determining its ra ngs. These ra ngs are u lized
by poten al investors to assess their risk in terms of the County’s ability
IX-8

Figure DM-6: Cuyahoga County Ra ngs Summary

The County has AA/Aa1 ra ngs from, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s
Investors Services on its long-term general obliga on debt. These ra ngs
result in substan al savings to the County in terms of lower interest on
its debt. The Moody’s ra ng had been Aa since December, 1953, but
was revised to A1 in January, 1995, due to investment losses of $115
million incurred in the fourth quarter of 1994. The Aa bond ra ng was
restored ten months later by Moody’s in November, 1995, when it was
shown that cost cu ng strategies and higher than an cipated revenues
had restored the County to full financial health. Standard & Poor’s also
recognized the sound financial condi on of the County by gran ng its AA
ra ng in November 1995. This was the first me the County had sought
a general obliga on bond ra ng from Standard & Poor’s other than on an
insured basis. In January 1998, the County made ra ng presenta ons in
New York to both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Moody’s responded
with a refinement to the County’s ra ng from Aa to Aa2 under their
new ra ng system begun in 1997 and Standard & Poor’s upgraded the
County’s ra ng from AA to AA+. In July 1999, the County made a ra ng
presenta on to Moody’s in Cleveland that resulted in an upgrade to
Aa1 in October 1999. In late spring and early summer of 1999, Fitch
evaluated the County’s credit for the first me. They deemed that we
were worthy of their highest ra ng, AAA, in August of 1999.

Debt Management
The County has refinanced por ons of its long-term general obliga on
debt as well as por ons of the debt issued for Gateway and the Brownfield
Development Fund (refer to the sec on on Economic Development
Revenue Bonds). The refinancing ac vity that transpired in the la er
half of 2003 and first quarter of 2004 was ini ated to capitalize on
historically low long-term interest rates that have enabled the County to
realize substan al savings on its debt related interest costs. In October
of 2003, the credit ra ngs of the County were reaﬃrmed by the ra ng
agencies in conjunc on with this refinancing ac vity. Moody’s Investor
Service upgraded the ra ng on the County’s non-tax revenue bonds
(Gateway and Brownfields bonds) to Aa2 from Aa3. These bonds were
refinanced in February of 2004 as part of the County’s move to realize
interest savings by refunding exis ng long-term debt. These bonds
were upgraded because of the favorable legal structure of the pledge as
well as the County’s con nued maintenance of high coverage levels by
revenues. The County’s long-term debt ra ngs were again aﬃrmed by
all three ra ngs agencies in conjunc on with the issuance of the Series
2005 Refunding Bonds issued in April of 2005.
A review of the County’s bond ra ngs was requested by Standard and
Poor’s and Moody’s in early 2008. A er the review was completed
both ra ngs were aﬃrmed by both ra ng agencies. The only change
in the County’s ra ngs was a nega ve outlook applied to the Aa1
ra ng assigned by Moody’s. The change in outlook was a ributable to
unfavorable economic factors that the County has experienced since the
2001 recession.
Standard & Poor’s aﬃrmed its AA+ ra ng of the County in conjunc on
with the issuance of the $70 million in BANs. In February of 2009 Fitch
evaluated the County’s AAA ra ng and downgrade the ra ng on the LTGO
bonds to AA+ . The downgrade of the LTGO bonds to ‘AA+’ incorporated

IX-9

Fitch’s heightened concerns, given the limited pledge, that general
fund financial flexibility could be reduced given the dependence on
economically sensi ve sales tax revenue in an environment of nega ve
economic trends. The AAA ra ng on the voted jail debt was maintained.
The County’s credit was evaluated in conjunc on with the debt
issuance in December 2009 and again in December of 2010. All three
agencies upheld their ra ngs based on the strong financial management
exhibited by the County. The latest review included periodic surveillance
conducted by S&P and Moody’s in early 2012. Both firms upheld their
respec ve ra ngs and stable outlooks.
County credit ra ngs were evaluated again in October and December
2013 as a result of debt issuances in those same months by S&P and
Moody’s. While the Moody’s ra ng was upheld, S&P downgraded the
LTGO one notch to AA as a result of changes in criteria.
As of March 2014, these ra ngs were upheld for a conduit issue related
to a major economic development project that has germinated for
several years.
The amount of the debt service the County assumes and the plan for
structuring the financing will con nue to impact the future outlook the
ra ng agencies have on the County’s credit. Close a en on must be
paid to demonstra ng the ability to take on more debt while balancing
the challenges posed by the economic condi ons in the region.
The County prepared an annual disclosure document in conjunc on
with bonds and notes outstanding per SEC disclosure rules (Rule 15c2-

Debt Management
12). The Annual Informa on Statement document discloses relevant
financial, economic and demographic informa on about the County
and Greater Cleveland area. The County began publica on of an Annual
Informa onal Statement (AIS) in 1988, similar in content and purpose to
an oﬃcial statement, yet able to be used on a stand-alone basis. The AIS
has been published every year since 1988, except 1994. The most recent
AIS was completed in the third quarter of 2013 and filed electronically
with MSRB repor ng database (EMMA). The current AIS can be found

Economic Development Revenue Bonds

The County can use revenue bonds to provide capital for a variety of
local economic development projects. The authority to issue this
type of debt is provided in chapter 165 of the Ohio Revised code. This
provision of Ohio law allows local governments to issue bonds for the
purposes of economic development that serve a public purpose. The
debt is exempt from the direct and ten mill limita ons described in the
preceding paragraphs. Unlike general obliga on bonds, revenue bonds
cannot be secured with a pledge of tax dollars. A strict provision in the
Ohio cons tu on requires that debt issued for economic development
purposes be secured from no tax revenue sources of the County. In
most cases revenue bonds issued by the County are taxable meaning
interest paid to bond holders will be subject to federal income taxes.
The sources of repayment on revenue bonds are normally specific
project revenues such as loan repayments, admission taxes, payments
in lieu of taxes and General Fund contribu ons to annual debt service.

IX-10

Revenue bonds o en have a more complex structure and legal
requirements than the typical general obliga on bonds. The bond
issuance, use of proceeds and repayment are guided by strict covenants
contained in a trust indenture that is developed to define the financing
arrangement legal responsibili es of the County as issuer. The limita on
of issuance is capped by the amount of total non tax revenues available
or coverage. The County has a 1.5x coverage ra o outlined in all of its
trust indentures for outstanding revenue bonds. Bond proceeds and
annual debt repayment are usually overseen by a trustee who serves as
a fiscal agent for the bonds. In addi on to these characteris cs revenue
bonds of the County are generally rated on notch below the general
obliga on debt of the County.
The County has $414.8 million in outstanding economic development
revenue bonds at the start of 2014. The following sec ons detail the
five types of revenue bonds the County has issued in support of various
economic development projects.
Gateway Arena Project

$64,305,000 of Economic Development Revenue Gateway Arena bonds
are outstanding for debt issued for the Gateway Project in 1992, 1994,
2004 and 2010. The 2010 Series C bonds ($32.8 million) were issued
to refund a port if the Series 1994 bonds and the remaining balance
of the Series 2004B variable rate bonds. Debt service is payable from
admission taxes on the games and events and general Fund non tax
revenue sources. The County General Fund will not contribute towards
debt service in 2014.
In 1990, County voters approved a referendum authorizing the County
to impose an excise tax on sales of liquor, beer, wine and cigare es. This

Debt Management
tax was one of the revenue sources used to finance the Gateway Sports
Complex located on a 28-acre site in downtown Cleveland (the Gateway
Project). The Gateway Project includes Progressive Field (formerly
Jacobs Field), Quicken Loans Arena (formerly Gund Arena), two parking
garages and related common area improvements. The Gateway
Economic Development Corpora on of Greater Cleveland (Gateway),
an Ohio nonprofit corpora on, was organized to facilitate the financing,
construc on and opera on of the sports facili es included in the
Gateway Project under the terms of an agreement between it, the City
and the County. Various financing arrangements have been made for
the Gateway Project, some of which con nued to involve the support of
the project.
The County is providing Gateway an annually renewable loan guaranty
from 1994 through 2014 for $27.5 million in stadium revenue bonds. The
Gateway Economic Development Corpora on refinanced this debt in
2004. The refunding bonds resulted in lowering the principal payments
and thereby the annual guaranty amount provided by the County.
Other than these guaran es, the County has no legal obliga on for the
payment of the Gateway bonds and these guaran es do not cons tute
a general obliga on debt of the County. The County appropriated $5.5
million for the Gateway guaranty agreement in 2014.

and no tax revenue sources from the general fund. The County General
Fund will contribute $1.2 million towards debt service in 2014.
In 1998, the County issued $15,465,000 of Taxable Economic
Development Revenue Bonds, Series 1998 (the Original Brownfield
Bonds) to provide the ini al funding for the County’s Brownfield
Redevelopment Fund Program (the Brownfield Program). The Brownfield
Program was established to lend money to municipali es and private
en es to assist with the payment of environmental costs associated
with the cleanup and use of underused and abandoned commercial and
industrial proper es within the County. In 2004, the County issued its
$12,880,000 Taxable Economic Development Revenue Refunding Bonds,
Series 2004C (Brownfield Redevelopment Fund Project) (the Brownfield
Bonds), to refund the original Brownfield Bonds. The Brownfield Bonds
are secured by non tax revenue of the County and certain project
revenues held by the trustee. Under the terms of the indenture securing
the Brownfield Bonds, the County has agreed to appropriate and deposit
into a pledged fund held by the bond trustee annually in each year while
any of the Brownfield Bonds are outstanding an amount of nontax
revenues suﬃcient, together with other moneys deposited previously
and remaining in that fund, to pay debt service on the Brownfield Bonds
in that year. The County issued Series 2010A Brownfield Bonds in the
amount in 17.16 million to support addi onal projects.

Brownfield Redevelopment Fund
Commercial Redevelopment Fund

$5,510,000 Taxable Economic Development Revenue Refunding Bonds,
issued for the County’s Brownfield Redevelopment Fund, in 2004 remain
outstanding. The County issued new Brownfield bonds Series 2010A
of which $15,355,000 are outstanding. See Brownfield Redevelopment
Fund Program and Other Economic Development Obliga ons. Debt
service is payable from certain project revenues from loan repayments

IX-11

$9,930,000 of non-tax revenue bonds were issued as Series 2010B
Commercial Redevelopment Bonds to fund a redevelopment loan fund
for redeveloping commercial sites and buildings.. Average annual debt
service is approximately $890,000 annually over the life of the bonds.

Debt Management
The County approved the crea on of a $13 million Cuyahoga County
Commercial Redevelopment Fund (CRF) as part of the County’s ongoing
economic development eﬀorts. Based on both the success and the basic
structure of the Cuyahoga County Brownfield Redevelopment program,
the CRF is focused on the reuse of vacant structures that have a bligh ng
influence on a community. The buildings, o en termed ‘grayfields’,
may have obsolete floor plans, out of date infrastructure, asbestos
remedia on or lead paint issues. The CRF is open to Cuyahoga County
municipal corpora ons, private redevelopers, business and non-profit
community development corpora ons (on behalf of for-profit projects).
Shaker Square Revenue Bonds (tax exempt)

2,545,000 Tax-Exempt Economic Development Revenue Bonds, Series
2010D remain outstanding in 2014. The bonds were issued to refund
Series 2000A bonds that were issued to make a loan to finance a por on
of the cost of improvements to the Shaker Square Complex. Debt service
is payable from revenues designated from a tax incremental financing
agreement ed to the project. The County is obligated to cover any
shor all in revenue with a General Fund contribu on.
In March 1999, the County sold $2.855 million of fixed-rate Shaker Square
Tax-Exempt Economic Development Revenue Bonds, Series 2000A. This
issue was sold on a subordinated basis to the Gateway and Brownfield
issues and is secured by a pledge of the County’s non-tax revenues.
The series 2000 bonds were refunded with series 2010D bonds in the
amount of $2.93 million. In addi on to this pledge, the project was
expected to generate suﬃcient tax increment financing (TIF) revenues
to make all debt service payments including those payments made prior
to the improvement being placed on the tax duplicate. The ability of
the Shaker Square project to con nue to be self suppor ng depends on
the viability of retail at the site and a stable property valua on. The
IX-12

annual guaranty went into eﬀect and County dollars have been used to
cover a majority of the debt service since 2007. The County an cipates
it will have to contribute $123,315 of the $171,100 required payment in
2014. The County also issued taxable Series B bonds in the amount of
$1.2 million that were privately placed. These bonds are not secured by
the County’s non-tax revenues and the County has no financial liability
to pay debt service.
Global Center for Health InnovaƟon Project

In December of 2010, the County issued $343.33 million in Taxable
Economic Development bonds ($307.3 million outstanding) the
proceeds of which were used to fund the construc on of the project.
Cuyahoga County teamed with MMPI, Inc. to create a combina on

Chicago, and conven on center in downtown Cleveland (“Conven on
Center/Medical Mart”). The project is replacing the 80-year old current
conven on center and renova ng the public infrastructure on these key
parcels in the heart of Cleveland’s central business district. Cuyahoga
County owns the land and leases it to MMPI, who will own and operate
all of the improvements for the life of the County’s bond financing.
MMPI acted as developer and formed an opera ng company for the
purpose of developing and opera ng the site (for purposes here, MMPI).
MMPI leased the facility to Cuyahoga County who then subleased the
facility back to MMPI. Construc on was completed in summer of 2013.
Ownership of the improvements will revert to Cuyahoga County upon
the final maturity of the bonds in 2027. The County will maintain a
leasehold mortgage on the improvements.
The basic business arrangement between the par es featured the
county selling bonds and providing the net proceeds to MMPI for
project development pursuant to the County’s powers under the Ohio

Debt Management
Cons tu on and Ohio Revised Code Chapter 165. The bond issue
consisted of three series of bonds and included alloca ons of Recovery
Zone Economic Development bonds and Recovery Zone Facility bonds.
The bonds were secured with non tax revenues of the County and have
combined maximum annual debt service of $32.7 million. The County
ins tuted a .25% general sales tax increase in October 2007. The
increase generates approximately $43.5 million in new tax revenue. The
debt service is actually repaid from non tax revenues of the County in
the form of a General Fund contribu on in the amount of the annual
debt service. All payments to both debt service and opera ng payments
(rent) are made possible by the addi onal revenue generated from the
addi onal sales tax and lodging tax.
In January 2014, the County separated from MMPI and named SMG
as the new operator of the facility with a revised opera ng agreement
with one of the leading conven on center management groups in the
industry. The basic opera ng agreement remains largely intact. Upon
comple on of the facility, the County is ac vely planning and construc ng
an adjoining conven on center hotel that would bring together three
structures to form the Global Center complex.
Debt Service Funds

Future Financing

The County has plans to issue a variety of debt in 2014. The planned
issuance includes short term financing, refunding bonds, and short-term
revenue bonds in support of economic development. The financing plan
will have to balance the components of cost of funds (interest rate),
credit risk and aﬀordability associated with future debt issuance. The
overarching factor for planning the financing of these projects will be
aﬀordability. The dollars diverted from opera ons to pay for addi onal
debt service will have to be made up either from new revenue sources
or opera ng cost reduc ons. A summary table of planned future debt
issuance is provided in Figure DM-7.
The County an cipates issuing sales tax-backed debt for capital
improvements to buildings and equipment due to the current debt
limita on issue. An ongoing assessment of the improvement needs
is conducted by Public Works and OBM as part of the capital planning
cycle. Projects are priori zed and cost es mates are arrived at before
work begins on a project. Typically priority improvement projects will
be started in advance once a funding source is iden fied. When the new
bonds are issued, projects associated with future year debt financing

A debt service fund (a governmental fund) is established to account for
the principal and interest payments on general long-term liabili es. The
annual payments of principal and interest of County bonds and notes as
well as associated sources of repayment (revenue) are budgeted in the
several individual subsidiary debt service funds. Debt service payments
for the general obliga on bonds are all paid from the main debt
service fund. Debt service and associated revenue for the economic
development debt and the Rock Hall debt are tracked within individual
subsidiary debt service funds.

will be reimbursed with bond proceeds. The an cipated size of the 2015
issuance is approximately $60-$70 million. The County would u lize
its available statutory debt limit to issue general obliga ons bonds for
a por on of these projects but does not have the necessary capacity
within the ten mill limita on. Part of the analysis for these projects will
include determining feasible financing op ons that would u lize the
statutory debt limit along with other possible long-term debt op ons
such as sales tax revenue bonds.
As men oned earlier, the County has commi ed to ensure the Global
Center project is successful and will issue cer ficate of par cipa on to
support the redevelopment of a major hotel adjacent to the site. The
revenue bond issue of up to $8 million will be issued in the summer of
2014 and secured with sales tax revenue of the County. Payments from
a tax incremental financing agreement will be used to cover the annual
debt service of the bonds.

IX-14

The second round of incremental financing for the County’s $100
million economic development fund will start in 2014. The loan fund
will be providing capital for a wide array of local economic development
projects including property acquisi on, business a rac on and
innova on loans. The financing to be undertaken by the County will
provide capital for the loan fund in the form of proceeds that can be
loaned out. It is an cipated that the debt service will be funded with
General Fund dollars and certain project revenues an cipated from the
various supported projects.
