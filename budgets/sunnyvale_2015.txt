Office of the City Manager

CITY MANAGER’S ADOPTED BUDGET MESSAGE
I am pleased to present the FY 2014/15 Budget and accompanying Twenty-Year Resource
Allocation Plan. In adopting this budget, the City Council continued a strong tradition of
focusing on the community’s priorities while maintaining fiscal discipline. I commend the
Council for staying the course and keeping the City well positioned for the long term. This
budget presents a sustainable path forward that works to contain costs, while adding back to
important services such as public safety, parks, and library services. It continues to address
increases in personnel costs, makes significant investments in needed infrastructure
improvements, and sets a sustainable base that will maintain the City’s strong financial future.
The Sunnyvale City Council made several formal amendments to the Recommended Budget and
adopted the amended budget on June 24, 2014. The specifics of the budget as recommended to
Council are discussed in detail beginning with the Letter of Transmittal, which follows this
Adopted Budget Message.
This addendum addresses the adoption of amendments to the
Recommended Budget, as well as the changes to the budget that were made between the delivery
of the Recommended Budget to Council on May 2, 2014 and the approval of the Adopted
Budget on June 24, 2014.
Three formal amendments were made when the budget was adopted. All three appropriations
were funded from the Council’s FY 2014/15 Service Level Set Aside funding. Council
appropriated an additional $25,000 to Project Sentinel for dispute resolution services,
augmenting Budget Supplement No. 1. The Teen Advisory Committee received a $10,000
appropriation to allow for a committee member and chaperone to travel to and participate in a
National League of Cities Conference. Finally, Council funded Budget Supplement No. 9 to
provide the Sunnyvale Downtown Association with $30,000 in funding to provide special events
and update their visitor’s guide. This supplement was not recommended for funding in the
Recommended Budget. These three amendments draw down Council’s FY 2014/15 Service
Level Set Aside to $35,000. In addition, a $200,000 appropriation from Community
Development Block Grant Funds to the Housing Trust Silicon Valley was a late addition to the
budget, and was added with the Adopted Budget.

While the signs are positive and most economists
are forecasting 2014 will be better than 2013,
there are many risks and vulnerabilities as well.
At the national level, the Federal Reserve is still
unwinding the federal stimulus policies, bank
credit remains tight and there are growing concerns
about the widening income inequality gap. Of
particular concern to Sunnyvale is the potential for
corrections in the financial and housing markets
and the continued restraint in business investment
spending. These elements have a direct impact on
the City’s major revenue sources such as Property
Tax at 37% and Sales Tax at 22% of General Fund
revenue, respectively. In fact, while the City’s
Property Tax revenues have shown solid gains
through this recovery period, our revenue from
Sales Tax, which has a significant business-tobusiness sales component, has been more volatile
with FY 2012/13 total revenues unexpectedly
coming in less than FY 2011/12 revenues. With
this kind of volatility from the second largest
revenue source in the General Fund, we took

Moderate Economic Recovery Continues
The country continues to recover from the worst
recession since World War II at a slow and modest
pace that began in June 2009. The economy ended
2013 on a strong note with increased consumer
spending, continued decline in the jobless rate, a
solid gains in the stock market and more stable
housing sector recovery. California’s Bay Area
region has been at the forefront of the recovery
with significant growth in job creation and rising
home prices. Sunnyvale has helped lead the
recovery as evidenced by several key indicators:

The citywide FY 2014/15 Recommended
Budget totals $314.6 million and includes all
City operations and project expenditures. The
City’s General Fund, which accounts for 50% of
the citywide budget, has proposed expenditures
of $157.3 million. While the General Fund is
projected to be balanced over the short and long
term, challenges continue to put pressure on
the Fund, requiring us to remain vigilant and
disciplined to ensure we maintain our financial
stability for the long term.

I am pleased to present for your review and

Budget and Twenty-Year Resource Allocation
Plan. While there has been transition at the
executive level midway through the development
of this recommended budget, the comprehensive
plan developed over the last several years and the
continuing economic recovery have allowed us to
stay the course and continue on the path of longterm fiscal sustainability.

economy but also moderate for the anticipated year-to-year volatility and the inevitable cooling off from
peak activity levels we are currently experiencing.

Five Key Commitments
The strong financial picture for the City would not have been possible without the adherence to the five
key commitments first detailed in the budget two years ago. These five commitments have provided a
plan of action and clear direction in the development of the long-term financial plan:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Manage our personnel costs;
Fund retirement costs for long-term sustainability;
Get to optimum service levels through strategic review/analysis;
Establish long-term funding for the City’s infrastructure needs;
Commit to a long-term comprehensive solution and stay the course.

The City has made significant progress in all of these areas by:

Negotiating with all employee bargaining units no salary increases for one to three years;
Holding FY 2013/14 salary increases to the amount budgeted;
Putting in place reduced benefit second- and third-tier retirement plans for all new employees;
Increasing employee contributions for retirement costs;
Growing the City’s OPEB trust to pre-fund retiree medical costs, which is now over $50 million and 38%

Reorganizing and realigning services and departments;
Implementing the Community Services Officer (CSO) model in the Public Safety Department;
Adding seven positions in the FY 2013/14 Budget across four departments;
Adding five additional positions after the adoption of the FY 2013/14 Budget: one public safety officer, one
dispatcher, one parks worker, one assistant planner and one building inspector;
Increasing the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) to 79, which is on target to reach the optimal level of 80

Restoring the seven-year tree trimming cycle; and
Programming $1.5 million annually, totaling $30 million over twenty years, toward additional investment
in our infrastructure.

With this recommended budget, we are building upon this substantial progress. We maintain the more
modest salary increases that have been assumed over the twenty-year plan. We continue to build into
the long-term plan the full employee contribution of the employee portion of retirement costs by 2019
for non-sworn employees and 2020 for sworn employees. While we had already incorporated increased
employer contribution rates for the retirement plans into the long-term financial plan, we have updated our
projections with the latest actuarial and demographic assumption data. We also continue to strategically
add resources in key areas:
•	 Two additional positions to support the Water Pollution Control Plant reconstruction project;
•	 One additional programmer analyst to support the growing technology demands within the organization;

impacts from the growth in development activity
and our continually aging infrastructure. There
are also internal demands that require resources,
particularly in the area of technology. The City’s
outdated building permitting system is currently
in the replacement process and we are beginning
the first phase to replace the seventeen-year old
financial system. As part of the replacement of the
financial system, we have the opportunity to reexamine our performance-based budgeting model
and ensure it continues to meet the needs of the
Council, community and staff for allocating the
City’s resources.

We are also increasing funding for wastewater
operations to address additional regulatory
requirements and the rising costs of maintaining
a deteriorating Water Pollution Control Plant.
Because the overall approach as we developed
this budget was to “hold the line,” we added these
additional resources to areas with the most urgent
and critical needs, and only after much analysis
and discussion.

Addressing the City’s Aging Infrastructure

Pressures and Challenges

We have made great progress in addressing the
funding needs for the City’s infrastructure, but
there is still more work to do. For both our utilities
and public roadway infrastructure, we have
developed funding plans for the short and long
term and have made real progress by completing
projects as we execute to our plan. While the
funding side has been the focus, another important
aspect is determining the appropriate service
level for maintaining City infrastructure such as
sidewalks, trees and sewer lines. Better defining
the service levels will be a focus in the coming
year.

While the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget and
Twenty-Year Resource Allocation Plan presents a
structurally balanced plan over the short and long
term, there are several pressures and challenges
that will impact our long-term sustainability if we
do not address them in a timely manner.

Increasing Service Demands

For our City administrative facilities, we have set
aside $30 million over twenty years to address
infrastructure needs and we continue to grow the
balance in the Capital Improvement Reserve of
the General Fund for one-time capital projects.
The key next step will be to confirm Council’s
decisions regarding the Civic Center campus and
administrative facilities. Part of this confirmation
will include funding levels and sources. With
clear direction, we can then appropriate these setaside funds to specific projects and proceed with
rehabilitating and/or renovating our facilities.

13

I NTRODUCTION

The most significant pressure is the increasing
demand on City services. Due to the global
recession,
City staffing was reduced out of
necessity by eliminating certain vacant positions.
Because personnel-related costs outpaced revenue
growth following the recession, we added
positions very judiciously since. As a result, the
City has a nearly 20% smaller workforce now
compared to a decade ago, despite a population
that is 10% larger during that same period. We
have used technology, reorganized departments
and implemented different staffing models to meet
service demands as cost effectively as possible;
however, the pressure continues, especially
with many new and increasing demands on the
organization such as: sustainability initiatives,

City Manager's Message
FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget

Rising Costs in Utilities Operations

•	 Salary increases of no more than 2% for the first
ten years and 3% for the second ten years for
all non-sworn employees after the expiration of
current contracts.
•	 For sworn employees, a salary increase of 4% for
FY 2014/15, then 3% for the remaining first ten
years and 4% in the second ten years. Because
the contract with the Public Safety Officers’
Association (PSOA) uses a salary survey to
determine salary increases and the Public
Safety Managers’ Association (PSMA) salary
adjustments are tied to those of PSOA, the City’s
ability to contain salary increases for these two
groups is limited. The historical average annual
salary increase has been higher than 4% so the
budget assumes the salary survey will be modified
as a result of negotiations with PSOA when the
contract expires in 2015.
•	 All employees will pay the entire employee
contribution rate for retirement benefits over the
next several years. The budget assumes all nonsworn employees will contribute 8% of pay by
FY 2018/19 and sworn employees will contribute
9% of pay by FY 2019/20.

Another pressure is the rising costs related to
operating our utilities. Regulatory requirements
are tightening. Wastewater discharge requirements
in our portion of the Bay are the most stringent,
and storm water and air quality regulations are
driving operating costs up. The Zero Waste
Policy will cost the City a significant amount to
implement, potentially driving solid waste costs
up by several percentage points. Solid waste and
wastewater rates will also be impacted by the
trash reduction plan to keep litter from the City’s
storm water system. Additionally, maintaining
and operating the deteriorating Water Pollution
Control Plant while simultaneously building a new
facility requires increased staff and potentially
costs more in materials such as chemicals. The
City’s wholesale water providers are facing
infrastructure needs similar to ours, and are now
engaged in managing drought conditions, which
can have financial impacts as well as impacts on
the community’s day-to-day activities.

I NTRODUCTION

Containing Personnel Costs

We must continue to be vigilant and focused
because the costs for our two largest benefits,
retirement and medical, are driven by many factors
outside of our control. Further, as Figure 1 on the
following page indicates, it is the cost for these
two benefits, particularly retirement, that is driving
much of the growth in compensation. Figure 1
includes salaries, retirement costs and medical
premiums paid by the City for all full-time and
part-time employees over the last eleven years. As
noted earlier, the City’s workforce declined nearly
20% over this same period.

As a service organization, employee salaries and
benefits are the largest component of the City’s
operating expenditures, accounting for 58% of
the total citywide budget. Containing this growth
has been central to achieving structural balance
in the City’s budget over the short and long term.
Working together with our bargaining units, we
have made considerable progress. Furthermore,
the long-term financial plan lays out assumptions
for salary increases and increased employee
contributions to retirement over the next several
years that provide the parameters to maintain
structural balance. However, these assumptions
are only good as long as we implement them. With
several labor agreements expiring in 2014 and
2015, this will be the challenge. In particular, this
budget assumes:

Because of our long-term approach, we have
already
anticipated
increasing
employer
contributions rates from CalPERS and have
been contributing more than CalPERS required
for several years. As a result, the City already

actuarial and demographic assumptions changes CalPERS has just adopted which will increase rates
by approximately 40% over the next five years. The rate methodology changes will improve the longterm fiscal sustainability of the retirement plans by paying down unfunded liabilities over a fixed period.
However, the changes also will result in more volatile rate increases year-over-year as gains and losses
are recognized over a much shorter period. To deal with this volatility, we have increased budgeted
contribution rates and continue to build reserves in this recommended budget.
There also is greater uncertainty with increases in medical premiums over the next several years. The City
contracts with CalPERS for medical benefits and CalPERS is currently adjusting their geographical areas
that help set the pricing structure. Our preliminary information indicates Bay Area premiums will rise as
a result of the changes. Another part of the uncertainty is the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our
premiums. With the continually changing regulations, we do not know the full impact at this time. To
address these uncertainties, we have adjusted our assumptions for medical premium increases upward.
With these significant uncertainties and uncontrollable factors, it is especially important to stay the course
with our plan and those elements that we can control.

While our focus over the past several years has been on controlling our expenses, we must also strengthen
our revenue base. We have begun this effort with the recent increase to our Transient Occupancy Tax
(TOT) rate from 9.5% to 10.5%. With the increased hotel development activity and current level of
demand, this rate increase occurred at a beneficial time. As a result, we have increased projections for this
revenue source significantly in this recommended budget. It is worth noting that even with this increase,
Sunnyvale’s TOT rate is less than several surrounding communities and a neighboring city is considering
an increase from 12% to 14%.

Strengthening Our Long-Term Revenue Base

City Manager's Message
FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget

I NTRODUCTION

Even though TOT revenues currently look strong,
it is important to note that three out of five of our
largest tax sources are highly volatile. Sales Tax,
TOT and Construction Tax are heavily impacted
by economic business cycles and consequently
our revenue fluctuations have been significant.
In addition, the Sales Tax and Utility Users Tax
(UUT) both have an eroding base that is resulting
in declining revenue over the long term. Although
changes to the application of Sales Tax will need
to occur at the State and Federal level, the UUT
is a local tax and we will be exploring ways to
modernize the ordinance and a potential increase
to the rate in 2015.

Overview of the Recommended Budget
There are three key elements to the City’s budget and resource allocation plan that provide the financial
picture of the City for both the short and long term: revenues, expenditures and reserves. The following
sections discuss the highlights, key assumptions and changes included in this recommended budget for
each of these elements. It is important to note these elements are budgeted into specific funds, such as
the Park Dedication Fund and the Gas Tax Fund, primarily to ensure that revenues restricted to specific
purposes are spent for those purposes. While the discussion here is not organized by fund, this important
structure is reflected in the budget document with the presentation of twenty-year financial plans for each
of the City’s 27 funds. Detailed discussions about revenues, expenditures and reserves by specific fund
are included with the financial plans.

City Revenues and Resources
The City relies on many sources of revenues and the strategic use of reserves to fund services to the
community at a stable and sustainable level. As Figure 2 shows, the largest revenue categories are taxes
and service fees.

Taxes, imposed by a government for the purpose of raising revenue to support governmental activities, are
distinctly different from fees in that a tax does not need to be levied in proportion to the specific benefit
received by a person or property. Therefore, almost all of the City’s tax revenues are in the General
Fund, the primary general purpose fund of the City. Taxes account for 73% of the total revenues in the
General Fund, supporting many of the most visible and essential city services such as police, fire, road

further reduces revenues for FY 2014/15 and FY
2015/16. Given the ongoing volatility and the
erosion of the Sales Tax base as we continue to
move into more of a service-based economy, we
feel an adjustment to the base is warranted as we
look out over the long term. The overall impact of
reducing the Sales Tax base to the City’s General
Fund long-term financial plan is a $42 million
decrease over twenty years.

The proposed revenues present a mixed outlook
and reflect the volatility in key tax revenue
sources. As part of the development of the
recommended budget, the current year projections
are also updated. Based on year-to-date figures, we
anticipate FY 2013/14 revenues for Property Tax,
Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) and Construction
Tax to exceed initial projections made for the
FY 2013/14 Adopted Budget. We have revised
estimates downward for Sales Tax, Utility Users
Tax (UUT) and Gas Tax revenues.
Property Tax revenue has experienced strong
growth in the last year, driven by activity in the
residential real estate market. Revenues from the
commercial/industrial sector also have increased
significantly. We anticipate continued strong
revenue growth in Property Tax revenue for the
next two years, led by the commercial sector, due
to the lag time in getting major developments onto

these important expenditures.

for Sunnyvale’s hotels, this revenue source has
correlated with the level of economic activity and
followed Sales Tax revenue trends. Currently,
TOT is not tracking with Sales Tax; instead
TOT revenue continues to remain strong and is
anticipated to stay strong through FY 2014/15.
Two additional factors impact the positive forecast.
Effective January 1, 2014, the City increased the
TOT rate by 1% to 10.5%. In addition, the FY
2014/15 Recommended Budget assumes that
three new hotels will be operating by FY 2016/17,
one more than was forecast in last year’s budget.
Because of the heavy reliance on business travel
and the resulting volatility, we have used historical
room and occupancy rates for projections starting
in FY 2015/16.

Construction Tax returns have been very strong,
an indication of the high level of development
activity that the City has sustained for three
consecutive years.
We anticipate that this
historically high level will cool off, with an
elevated amount estimated for FY 2014/15 and the
historical average level planned beginning in FY
2015/16.

Service Fees

Utility Users Tax revenue, generated from the
sale of electricity, telecom services, and the sale of
gas, is forecasted to show modest growth overall.
Increased development activity, in particular the
impact of additional buildings within the City,
is growing the base. However, the impact of
this growth has been substantially negated by
energy efficiency. The telecom tax base has been
deteriorating because the bulk of the growth is
related to areas not included in the tax calculation,
such as data transmission. This recommended
budget continues to anticipate a decline in this
portion of the UUT over the long term.

Utility Rates - The City has three utility funds that
are fully self-supporting: the Water Supply and
Distribution Fund, the Solid Waste Management
Fund and the Wastewater Management Fund. Each
year, as part of the budget process, staff analyzes
the current condition and long-term outlook for
all three funds. The analysis includes a review of
fund balances; State and Federal environmental
requirements; revenues; anticipated capital,
infrastructure and operational requirements; and
a detailed inspection of significant expenditure

AND

Gas Tax, levied as a flat rate per gallon sold, is
projected to hold flat in the long-term financial
plan. Because the tax is based on volume sold
and not on the price of gasoline, our projections
consider that advancements in fuel economy
will offset increased population and number of
vehicles. While this revenue source holds flat, or
declines over time, the costs and needs for street
maintenance and improvements continue to climb.
There is discussion at the State and Federal level
to make changes to the Gas Tax and how it is
levied. In the meantime, the City’s General Fund

Service fees are the City’s largest source of
revenue. We charge a diverse set of fees to recover
all or a portion of the City’s costs for providing
a service or access to public property, or for
mitigating the impacts of the fee payer’s activities
on the community. Intended for cost recovery, a
fee may not exceed the estimated reasonable cost
of providing the service or facility for which the
fee is charged. Because of this basis and the legal
restrictions related to the expenditure of many of
the fees, many of the City’s fees are accounted
for in separate funds. By far, the largest source
of fee revenue comes from fees, also commonly
called rates, for the provision of water, sewer and
refuse collection services. The proposed increases
in utility rates are discussed below, as well as
significant highlights in other fee categories.

to rates that will generate the revenues necessary
to meet planned expenditures. Through the longterm planning model, staff attempts to keep utility
rates as stable as possible with modest increases
annually, versus keeping rates flat and impacting
customers with a high increase in one year. The
overall recommended increase for FY 2014/15 is
shown above, in Figure 4, with the total planned

will reduce revenues by an estimated 10%. Both
the wholesalers have agreed to reduce the City’s
minimum purchase requirements, so the revenue
loss will be largely offset by savings in buying
less water. However, as with all utilities, there are
fixed costs to operate the water system which are
not based on the volume of water delivered. As
such, there is some risk that drought reductions
will result in higher than anticipated rates in the
future.

Each of the utility enterprises has its own unique
pressures that are driving rate adjustments. The FY
2014/15 Recommended Budget is the first year in
the two year operating budget cycle. As such, each
utility went through a detailed review of operating
expenditures. Additionally, although not a capital
budget cycle, the utility capital and infrastructure
projects are significant enough that adjustments
have been made based on the changing priorities in
each of the utilities.

The wastewater rates are being driven primarily by
costs associated with improvements to the City’s
wastewater collection and treatment system and
stricter regulatory requirements. The main driver
of rates in the Wastewater Management Fund is
the need to replace the City’s aging wastewater
treatment plant. The rates include an assumption
that the City will issue utility revenue bonds to
fund the project over many years; annual debt
service costs are expected to be over $22 million
by FY 2023/24 after all the bonds have been
issued. This debt service expense is substantial – it
will make up a third of the Fund’s total expenditure
requirements.

In the water utility, the costs of purchasing water
from wholesale water providers and infrastructure
rehabilitation continue to drive rate increases. This
year, the drought has added a layer of financial
uncertainty to the Fund. Both of the City’s water
wholesale suppliers are calling for reductions
in water use. Although not mandatory yet, the
financial plan assumes that the drought will affect
both revenues and expenditures. The rates include
an anticipated 10% reduction in water use, which

The operating costs for this Fund are also up
significantly to address both capital and operating
needs. Costs for chemicals to treat wastewater are
up over $300,000 per year due to increased usage.

General Fund to hold revenues collected in excess
of what was budgeted for development-related
revenue for FY 2012/13. Development activity
has continued at record levels through FY 2013/14
so additional excess revenue is anticipated to be
carried over into the new fund for FY 2014/15. It
should be noted that Construction Tax, while tied
to development activity, is a tax and will therefore
remain in the General Fund.

Solid waste rates are driven by increases in the
costs for the collection of solid waste; potential
increases resulting from the current procurement
process underway to award a new contract for
the operation of the SMaRT Station; and the costs
for beginning the implementation of the City’s
Zero Waste Policy. A portion of the increases in
cost were offset by savings through the extension
and restructuring of the landfill disposal contract.
However, because economic cycles impact
demand for solid waste services and revenues
as a result, the Fund is still recovering from the
Great Recession and is unable to absorb many of
these cost increases through the use of reserves.
Therefore, solid waste rates are increasing two
percentage points more than anticipated last year.

Development-Related Fees - Developmentrelated fees (e.g., plan check fees, inspection
fees and permit application fees) and related
expenditures have been in the General Fund, where
total development-related revenue was one of the
top five revenue sources in that Fund. Over the last
several years, staff has been evaluating the fees and
costs to ensure the City is charging the appropriate
level of fees and obtaining full cost recovery. As
part of this evaluation, we determined a separate
fund would be beneficial for several reasons:
the fund will allow us to track revenues and
expenditures separately, because these fee revenues
are highly volatile and expenditures related to
specific fees can occur later than when the revenue
is collected; and a separate fund allows us to build
and draw down on a separate reserve. We are
creating this separate fund starting in FY 2014/15.
In preparation for the start of this fund, a separate
Development Enterprise Reserve was created in the

C ITY R EVENUES

With several large-scale development projects
in the Moffett Park and Peery Park areas, staff
estimates an elevated level of revenue for FY
2014/15. However, this will be the fourth year
of increased activity, and history has shown us
that this revenue is highly volatile with very wide
swings between the peaks and valleys. As a result,
a historical average has been budgeted starting in
FY 2015/16. On the expenditure side, a detailed
analysis was conducted to ensure all related
costs are reflected in the new fund. This was a
complex process to identify costs across several
departments including Community Development,
Public Works, Public Safety, Environmental
Services, Offices of the City Manager and City
Attorney, and Library and Recreation Services.
To ensure a careful, methodic approach, our focus
this year was to identify the direct costs. Over
the next year, along with the structure of the fees,
we will identify indirect costs. With the direct
costs, the first version of the fund presented in this
recommended budget indicates the historical level
of revenues will not fully cover expenditures over
the long term. As a result, fees will need to be
increased. As we develop more actual history, this
separate fund will assist us in ensuring full cost
recovery.

fees. Impact fees have strict requirements, set by state government code, that require fees to be roughly
proportional to the impacts of the project and imposed for purposes related to the impacts of the project.
Therefore, each of these fees is accounted for separately in its own fund or sub-fund. With development
activity in the City currently at record levels, revenue from these fees has been significant. In total,
the City collected $18.6 million in revenue from these four fees in FY 2012/13. Based on year-to-date
figures, we estimate collecting $14 million for FY 2013/14. With the known development projects in the
permitting process currently, significant revenue is anticipated for FY 2014/15. Because of the volatile
nature of development projects, it is challenging to forecast impact fee revenue beyond the most immediate
years. As Figure 5 shows, Park Dedication and Sense of Place fee revenue is expected to remain high
through FY 2016/17, based on several large projects triggering these fees, and then a historical average is

2015/16 for the Transportation Impact and Housing
Mitigation fees. Because this was not a projects
budget development year, the revenue projected
above last year’s budget is not appropriated and is
primarily reflected as increases to fund reserves.

Over the longer term, a combination of greater
revenue growth and further expenditure reduction
is required for this fund to be structurally balanced
and staff continues to explore both areas. An
additional longer term pressure is the funding of
capital improvements. Current planned capital
projects are funded by Park Dedication fees
through FY 2032/33, but subsequently the Golf
and Tennis Fund is expected to fund its own capital
and infrastructure. Given the many challenges, a
discussion of the long-term viability of the golf
course operations and the current funding model
needs to begin in the next year.

Golf Fees - Newly configured in FY 2012/13, the
Golf and Tennis Fund has struggled over the last
two years to operate as a true enterprise fund, with
all activities attempting to be self-supporting. Due
to the sudden departure of the restaurant operator
for the two golf courses in 2012, golf revenues
suffered greatly and the General Fund provided a
$300,000 subsidy to cover anticipated deficits for
FY 2012/13 and FY 2013/14. During this time,
staff has made good progress in restructuring
staffing to reduce expenditures; however growing

As such, in the General Fund, sale of property
revenue is placed in the Capital Improvement

General Fund reflects updated numbers for the
sale of the Raynor Activity Center. Based on
the accepted sales price, $14 million is now
anticipated. The budgeted use of these proceeds
also has been updated. As detailed in the Report
to Council on the sale (RTC 13-275), this
recommended budget includes the budget to design

The remaining revenue sources are varied
including franchises, rents, fines, licenses and
interest income. There are also one-time revenues
in this category such as bond proceeds, federal and
state grants and sale of property. Highlights of
other revenue sources are discussed below.
Debt Financing - We use debt financing as a tool
to maintain long-term financial stability by paying
for certain expenditures over time. Debt financing
is a tool for managing cash flow when large, onetime outlays are required, generally for large
infrastructure projects.

Operating Expenditures
Operating expenditures reflect all of the costs to deliver the wide variety of services provided to our
community on an ongoing basis. We develop our budget in two-year cycles, alternating between the
operating budget and the capital budget. FY 2014/15 is the first year of a two-year operating budget
cycle. All departments went through an extensive review of their budget that included a detailed look
at both personnel and goods and services budgets. Departments also reviewed their program structures
and performance indicators. Changes in these areas are noted in the detailed department sections of this
recommended budget.
With the mixed picture we are projecting for our major revenue sources and the many pressures and
challenges we see on the horizon, we gave departments the direction to “hold the line” as they developed
the two-year operating budget. All departments worked to control or contain costs and, as Figure 7 on
the following page indicates, total budgeted operating expenditures are only up a modest 4.2%, which
includes assumptions for salary increases and higher costs for benefits.

the department removed booking fee costs of
$250,000 due to secured State funding; however
these savings were partially offset by a $100,000

Thursday evenings at the Library. LCS is also
adding funding to clean, upgrade or replace
furniture and expand its materials and technology
resources to bring the Library in line with the
average materials expenditure per capita in Santa
Clara County. The Recreation Division also is
reducing budgeted staff hours to bring them more
in line with historical trends. As a result, the
overall budget for the department is down from FY
2013/14.

Department of Public Works (DPW) made
moderate additions and adjustments across the
board to its budget. Included are items such as
increases in electric, gas, and water utility costs,
materials and supplies costs, and some minor
part-time personnel changes to meet changing
demands.
The department also includes two
internal service programs for facilities and fleet
maintenance.
Facilities maintenance remains
largely flat, continuing the focus on maintaining
the City’s facilities in working condition pending
larger policy decisions on replacement. Fleet also
maintains a largely flat budget with the exception
of additional budget for rising fuel prices, and the
inclusion of two new unmarked police cars for the
burglary suppression unit.

For FY 2012/13 and FY 2013/14, Council provided
supplemental funding to temporarily increase
service levels for Care Management services. This
provided funding for one part-time, unbenefited
position to supplement an existing position at
that same level. Staff is reviewing the impact
of the second position and will be coming back
to Council with options and recommendations
regarding the ongoing service level for Care

Community Development Department (CDD)
continues to experience a very high demand for
services, reflective of the significant amount of
development activity throughout the City. Despite
this, they maintain a relatively flat budget. The
department is adding approximately $15,000 in
costs related to compliance with tightening storm
water regulations, as well as increasing credit card
fees to accommodate the increased use of this
payment method.

More significantly, DPW is adding resources to its

The Human Resources Department (HRD) budget is up modestly, with funding added to address
increased activity related to labor negotiations, recruitment and personnel management needs.
The Information Technology Department (ITD) is adding a new Programmer Analyst and upgrading
one Network Engineer position to Principal Network Engineer. With the growth in the number of

savings as a result of moving to even year elections. City Council expenses are also reflected in this
budget.

Budget Supplements
Budget supplements are proposals to increase, decrease or change service levels. Each supplement is
presented separately and recommended for inclusion or exclusion from the FY 2014/15 Adopted Budget.
This year, the recommended budget includes nine budget supplements. Figure 8 lists the supplements
and the City Manager’s recommendation. If the supplement is recommended for funding, it has been
included in the financial plan of the affected fund. Details of each supplement can be found in the Budget
Supplements section of this recommended budget.

C ITYWIDE E XPENDITURES

Although the Office of the City Attorney (OCA) budget shows a reduction, this is due to a reallocation
of funds for outside legal services to other programs. Budgeted funds are moving from OCA to the
Property and Liability Insurance Fund for outside legal services related to liability claims. Outside legal
services budgets for specialized areas, such as utility operation, are also moving over to the appropriate
department.

Capital Projects and Infrastructure

Transportation projects cover a large variety
of efforts, from studies to large infrastructure
projects. Several significant efforts are underway,
funded by Federal grants provided through the
State. They include the interchange improvements
at Mathilda/237/101, the Fair Oaks Overhead
Bridge Rehabilitation and the Calabazas Creek
Bridge Replacement. Additionally, the budget
includes $6.5 million for FY 2014/15 for continued
pavement rehabilitation.

This year is the second year of the projects budget
cycle, so the only changes made to projects were
on an exception basis. We categorize our projects
into four broad categories: Capital, Infrastructure,
Special and Outside Group Funding. Capital
projects are efforts to construct new or expanded
facilities or infrastructure. Infrastructure projects
are to rehabilitate existing infrastructure. Special
projects are efforts like special studies or
initiatives.

Utilities - We have made great progress improving
our utility infrastructure over the last several years.
With the 2010 issuance of $18 million in water
bonds and $22.5 million in wastewater bonds, we
have funded and completed a significant amount of
work. To date, we have expended approximately
$35 million of the proceeds from both bond issues
directly on pipes, tanks, treatment infrastructure
and the beginning design phase for the replacement

As only minimal changes were made to projects,
the following section highlights current progress
on some of the City’s largest projects as well
as projects that are forthcoming within the next
several years.
Traffic and Transportation - As one of our
most significant areas of investment, Traffic and

of the WPCP. Contracts for master planning,
design of the primary treatment facilities, and
program management have all been awarded and
work is underway. Other efforts in the utilities
include work to implement our trash management
plan to protect our channels and creeks from litter,
and efforts to scope and implement the Council’s
direction on the Zero Waste Policy.

in this strategic and disciplined way is different
and more active than a typical city. We maintain
reserves for different purposes; some are restricted
in use while others are available for a variety
of priorities. Examples of restricted reserves
include debt service reserves or reserves of
special revenues. Unrestricted reserves are used
strategically over the twenty-year planning period
to balance each fund. We plan to add to them or
take from them as business and economic cycles
pass, allowing us to provide a stable and consistent
level of service. This is especially critical when
so many of our large revenue sources are volatile
by nature. Reviewing reserves over a long period
forces policymakers, staff and the community to
think carefully before adding services that must be
sustained through good times and bad.

City Parks, Library, and Facilities - Over the
past several years, we have identified the need
to improve or expand our library, administrative
facilities and parks. One of the most significant
efforts to that end is the impending completion
of Seven Seas Park, a brand new addition to our
well-regarded parks system. Additionally, with the
sale of Raynor Acitivity Center, we are going to be
able to engage in two projects to directly improve
service to the community. The Lakewood Branch
Library, budgeted at $11.5 million, will bring
needed library services to an underserved section
of the city. The second project is to accelerate
renovations to the Washington Pool, improving
the City’s recreational facilities. Other projects
underway or beginning shortly include expanding
Orchard Gardens Park, improving athletic fields
and other park facilities and rehabilitating the
Community Center.

In the General Fund, the unrestricted reserve is
the Budget Stabilization Fund. Disciplined and
strategic use of this reserve has allowed us to
weather the Great Recession, and is helping us to
strategically add back services in a planned way
to ensure sustainability over the long run. It will
also help us manage our infrastructure needs and
other pressures discussed at the beginning of this
transmittal.

City Reserves
The backbone of our financial planning process
is the Twenty-Year Resource Allocation Plan.
This planning document provides the framework
to maintain a structurally balanced budget by
requiring financial discipline in making policy
and service level decisions. One of the key
components of the financial plans are the various
reserves contained within each plan. While the
use of reserves is considered a best practice and
many organizations have them, our use of them

In both these cases, and throughout the budget,
reserves also allow us to deal with unexpected
expenditures. In the most extreme case, each
significant fund carries large contingency reserves

29

C ITY R ESERVES

In the utility funds, the use of the Rate
Stabilization Reserves allows for the measured
increase of rates to cover rapidly increasing costs
such as wholesale water costs and tightening
regulations on wastewater discharge. This reserve
also allows us to incrementally increase rates to the
level needed to support the significant debt service
associated with the replacement of the WPCP.

COMMUNITY CONDITION INDICATORS AND
BALANCED GROWTH PROFILE
COMMUNITY CONDITION INDICATORS
The Community Condition Indicators (CCIs) have been presented as an integral part of the City’s budget for many years. The CCIs have
traditionally been used as a measurement tool to evaluate and implement General Plan goals and policies. The CCIs today reflect the
changes adopted by City Council at the May 8, 2007 Council meeting as part of the “Transitioning from a Growth to a Steady-State City”
RTC #07-154. These indicators are the key demographic, economic, and physical data which describe the state of the City at a given point
in time. The importance of reporting community condition indicators is that their numerical values change over time as the community
changes, providing both a snapshot of current conditions and an indication of change over a longer time period.

BALANCED GROWTH PROFILE
The Balanced Growth (BGP) is a planning tool developed in 2007 (RTC #07-154), which can be used to monitor the City’s growth and
determine the relative balance among the indicators of growth and infrastructure. The BGP assumes that Sunnyvale was in a reasonably
balanced state in 2005 as indicated by the high level of satisfaction expressed by the population in the 2005 Resident Satisfaction Survey.
The profile is extended one year each year, adding on the incremental growth and improvements from the preceding year. Currently, the
BGP presents the first eight years, or 40 percent, of the 20-year planning horizon.
The first two rows in the BGP are the major indicators of growth: population and jobs. While there is a relationship between population and
housing and between jobs and industrial/office/commercial (I/O/C) square footage, the City only has direct influence over housing units and
I/O/C square footage. The projected growth in both indicators from 2005-2025 is based on the historic patterns of growth. These profiles do
not reflect the full build-out of the General Plan as they account for only 60 percent of net new housing units and 73 percent of net new
I/O/C square feet.
Projected population growth over 20 years is based on an average household size as applied to the number of new housing units and
projected job growth is based on historic average employees per square foot. The final four bars (public school capacity, transportation
capacity, utility capacity, and park capacity) represent the infrastructure needed to support the projected growth in population and jobs. The
Community Vision Chapter of the General Plan explains that transportation, parks, and utility bars may lag behind and then make large
leaps due to the high cost of some of the improvements. The original profile did not include projections for parks and utilities, anticipating
the completion of long-range plans for these items within the first few years of the profile when adopted in 2007.

37

GROWTH INDICATORS
POPULATION – HOUSING UNITS
JOBS – INDUSTRIAL/OFFICE/COMMERCIAL

INFRASTRUCTURE
With regard to supporting infrastructure and facilities (except for school capacity), capacity improvements necessary to support the expected
growth will be determined based on several City of Sunnyvale infrastructure plans. These infrastructure improvement plans include (or will
include) the estimated cost for capacity improvements. The cost for each improvement will be compared to the total program to determine
the proportion (percent) of the total program that the improvement represents. The bar on the chart will be extended by an increment
percentage as each improvement is completed. Only the transportation capacity improvements funded in whole or in part by the City of
Sunnyvale are included in the BGP. Projects initiated and funded by the state, regional, and county agencies are not included. The Profile
assumes that other jurisdictions are proceeding with planned capacity improvements at a reasonable pace in accordance with their plans.
SCHOOLS – As a proxy, school capacity is represented by the Sunnyvale School District capacity needs analysis (based on the Sunnyvale
General Plan) prepared in 2003 and the required increase in classroom space.
TRANSPORTATION – Transportation improvements are based on the Transportation Strategic Plan (TSP) originally prepared in 2003
(updated in 2013) and the percent of projects completed.
PARKS– Council examined the desired amount of parks several times since 2007. Staff is currently in the process of identifying a tool for
measuring park capacity improvements. The parks and open space capacity improvements plan is pending.
UTILITIES – The Water Utility Master Plan was adopted in 2010; the companion Sanitary Sewer Master Plan is expected in 2014.

READING THE PROFILE
The profile is divided into 20 segments, each representing one year (five percent) of the 20-year timeline. The current year, 2013, is 40
percent of the profile. Each year the profile is updated to reflect the growth in population, housing, I/O/C square footage, and jobs from the
prior calendar year, along with the completed capacity improvements. If all elements were growing in a balanced manner, all of the bars in
the profile would be of equal length every year, extending exactly to the then current year. This will not always be the case. An imbalance in
a single year does not signify a problem. An imbalance over multiple years, however, could be a concern to decision-makers, who may want
to consider modifications of development policy or priorities to infrastructure improvements to respond to the rate of growth. As the
Sunnyvale Community Vision is updated in the future, or as General Plan element updates result in different projected goals for 2025, the
BGP must be recalibrated to reflect revised projected increases.
Readers may want to compare the physical changes (housing units and I/O/C square footage) to the occupancy of these structures
(population and jobs) to aid in understanding growth in the community. For example, the housing units are below the current year mark yet
the population bar exceeds the same mark; note too that the public school capacity improvements are also above the current year mark.

38

Because all of the data is not available regarding other infrastructure it is premature to gauge whether there is a lack of balance relative to
this infrastructure.
Entitled projects will be reflected in the Current BGP once they are constructed; in the meantime they are reported on the Approved Not
Built profile. The Approved Not Built profile includes projects that may take several years to complete—for example the Juniper Networks
Campus in Moffett Park, approved in 2002, has only three of 10 buildings completed.

ACTUAL GROWTH VS. APPROVED GROWTH
Two profiles are available for information. Only the actual growth and infrastructure improvements that have occurred are reflected in the
first chart—as originally requested by Council. Development projects that have received entitlement as well as actual construction are
shown on the second chart (as requested more recently by Councilmembers). Care should be taken when examining the charts.
•
•

Not all approved projects are built (some expire, others are superseded); or projects may be built over long periods of time (over ten
years in some cases)
Growth in population or jobs may suggest priorities on infrastructure improvement different from infrastructure improvement
priorities suggested by growth in housing units and I/O/C square footage. The Community Condition Indicators may also suggest
slightly different nuances to priorities.

Notes
1. FY 2004/2005 is the base year for the Balanced Growth Index.  All revenues are converted to FY 2004/2005 dollars for comparison purposes.
2. This index only represents net new floor area, and does not reflect tenant improvements to existing floor area.
3. Data has been modified resulting in a decrease in base year, projections, and current year estimates. There is a significant challenge in finding reliable estimates of Sunnyvale jobs. This version of the Balanced Growth Profile provides Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) data from most recent publications while staff explores a more reliable annual estimate of jobs. Data for 2011 or 2012 is not yet available.
4. In a "balanced growth scenario" each profiled item would increase 5% each year. Cumulative "balanced growth" to the end of 2013 would be 40%.

Notes
1. FY 2004/2005 is the base year for the Balanced Growth Index.  All revenues are converted to FY 2004/2005 dollars for comparison purposes.
2. This index only represents net new floor area, and does not reflect tenant improvements to existing floor area.

Balanced
growth
scenario
for 2013.4

3. Data has been modified resulting in a decrease in base year, projections, and current year estimates. There is a significant challenge in finding reliable estimates of Sunnyvale jobs. This version of the Balanced Growth Profile provides Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG) data from most recent publications while staff explores a more reliable annual estimate of jobs. Data for 2011 or 2012 is not yet available.
4. In a "balanced growth scenario" each profiled item would increase 5% each year. Cumulative "balanced growth" to the end of 2013 would be 40%.

SUMMARY OF BUDGETED PERSONNEL HOURS
Overview
The City of Sunnyvale budgets by work hours, not by position. This enables staff to more accurately determine the amount of time
required to provide a service. In order to manage the positions, staff develops a budgeted position allocation by Department after the
adoption of the budget. Beginning in FY 2014/15, the City revised the level of productive hours per position to more accurately
reflect current conditions. The budgeted position allocation calculates full-time (FTE) and part-time (PTE) equivalents using the
following standards:
•
•
•
•

Management Staff
Non-management Staff
Public Safety Officers
Part-time Staff

FY 2011/12 – FY 2013/14
1,850 hours equals one FTE
1,800 hours equals one FTE
1,900 hours equals one FTE
1,090 hours equals one PTE

FY 2014/15
1,790 hours equals one FTE
1,760 hours equals one FTE
1,835 hours equals one FTE
1,090 hours equals one PTE

Staffing Trends
The tables on the following pages show the budgeted position allocation for full-time and part-time positions, by Department, and by
employment status on a City-wide basis. Two years of actual data, as well as the current and budget years’ data are presented.
The values reflected in the Actual FY 2011/12 and Actual FY 2012/13 columns are actual, filled positions in each department/job
category as of the end of the fiscal year. The values in the Current FY 2013/14 and Budget FY 2014/15 columns are the budgeted
positions in each department/job category. As of July 1st, 2014, the City had 805 active employees. The difference between the actual
positions and the budgeted positions is predominantly due to City-wide vacancies.

DEBT SERVICE

Overview
The City of Sunnyvale uses debt financing as a tool to maintain its long-term financial stability by paying for certain expenditures over
time. Debt financing is also a tool for managing cashflow when large, one-time outlays are required as in the case of constructing a new
building or large-scale upgrades to infrastructure. This section provides a summary of the City’s debt service for the twenty-year planning
horizon. Included is the Computation of Legal Debt Margin which calculates the City’s debt limit as defined by the City Charter. Also
included is the debt service schedule which represents the current bond issues for both the City and the Redevelopment Successor Agency.
The City does not have any general obligation debt.
Debt Policies
Section 1308 of the City Charter limits the allowable bonded indebtedness of the City at 15% of the total assessed valuation of property
within the City. However, Council’s adopted policies limit the use of debt even further. Council’s policy 7.1F Debt Management Policy
details the city’s approach to debt issuance. Key criteria include:
1.

2.
3.

Total bonded indebtedness supported by General Fund revenues should not exceed 5% of assessed valuation of property
within the City. Bond issues supported by the General Fund should be restricted to annual debt service of 5% of General
Fund revenue.
Land based financings should maintain a minimum property value-to-debt ratio of 3:1, with exceptions made for special
circumstances at Council’s discretion.
Debt service should not affect the City’s ability to meet future operating, capital and reserve requirements.

Issuer Credit Rating
Each entity that is allowed to issue bonds is rated on its ability to repay the debt. This rating is known as the Issuer Credit Rating (ICR),
which is an independent gauge of the credit risk of the issuer. Credit risk is based on the issuer’s solvency or ability to pay the interest and

59

principal. The greater the credit risk, the more interest the issuer has to pay to sell its bonds. Not only does the credit rating of the issuer
determine the initial yield of the bond, but it can also affect bond prices in the secondary market if the issuer’s credit rating changes.
There are five major services that rate bonds: Standard & Poors (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch, A.M. Best, and Dominion Bond
Rating Service. Ratings range from AAA for the highest quality bonds to D, which are bonds in default. Standard & Poors completed a
review of the City’s overall credit worthiness in April 2009. This resulted in an upgrade in our “Issuer Credit Rating” to AAA, affording
the City the highest possible underlying rating from S&P. In May 2012, this AAA rating was affirmed by S&P. The City also carries a
Aaa “Issuer Rating” from Moody’s, again the highest possible rating available. In January 2013 Moody’s confirmed Sunnyvale’s issuer
rating as Aaa. While Moody’s also downgraded the overall rating of the City’s 2009 Variable Rate Demand Refunding Certificates of
Participation (COPs) from Aa1 to Aa2, this downgrade was not specific to Sunnyvale, but part of Moody’s overall assessment of all COPs
in general. This downgrade does not reflect on the City’s underlying credit strength, which Moody’s concurrently affirmed at the Aaa
rating.

Summary of FY 2014/15 Debt Service
The FY 2014/15 Budget includes $10,324,775 in debt service payments (including agent fees). The level of debt associated with these
payments is significantly below the legal maximum allowable of approximately $4.4 billion and well below each of the three policy
criteria outlined above. Each bond issuance is briefly described below. The twenty-year schedule for debt service payments are shown in
the table on the following pages. It should be noted that future debt issuances are reflected in the twenty-year financial plan for planning
and funding purposes. The potential issuances are discussed in detail under the detailed fund reviews preceding the Financial Plans.
Revenue Bonds
Water Distribution System and Wastewater Infrastructure. Revenue bonds were originally issued in 1992 to construct the City’s
recycled water system and sludge management facilities. In 2001, the bonds were refunded to reduce debt service costs. At that time,
additional funds of $12.5 million were borrowed to pay for additional wastewater infrastructure projects. Debt service payments were
financed by water and wastewater revenues. In June 2010, the City issued $59 million of water and wastewater revenue bonds.
Approximately $41 million in bond proceeds were provided and are being used to construct new water and wastewater infrastructure
projects (including the initial work on a new water pollution control plant). The remaining amount, $18 million, were used to refund the
2001 outstanding bonds, to pay issuance costs, and to provide a debt service reserve account for the 2010 bonds.
SMaRT Station. These bonds were issued for the original cost of the Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT) Station.
This facility receives, sorts for recycling, and transports solid waste for the cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and Palo Alto. The
SMaRT Station’s debt service is financed by the three cities in proportion to their original investment in the SMaRT station. Sunnyvale’s
share of the debt service is financed by solid waste revenues.
In 2003 the bonds were refinanced in the amount of $20.6 million to reduce debt service costs. In 2007, the three cities approved a project
to replace the Materials Recovery Facility equipment. This replacement project was funded by reserves of $5.2 million in the Capital
Equipment Replacement Fund, a cash contribution of $2.2 million by Mountain View, and the issuance of $8.1 million in revenue bonds
by Palo Alto and Sunnyvale.

61

Redevelopment Successor Agency Tax Allocation Bonds and Certificates of Participation
Redevelopment District. The City’s Redevelopment Successor Agency has two bond-financed projects pursuant to the 1976 Town
Center development agreement. The financing obligation includes: the Central Core Redevelopment Project Tax Allocation Bonds
(TABs) and Parking Facility Certificates of Participation (COPs).
The Central Core Redevelopment Project Tax Allocation Bonds
In 1977, tax allocation bonds were sold to fund the acquisition of property, relocation, demolition and public improvements within the
Town Center project area. The bonds were twice refinanced. Debt service on 2003 TABs issuance is financed by property tax increment
revenues from the Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund (RPTTF).
Parking Facility Certificates of Participation
In 1977 and 1978, two issues of lease revenue bonds were sold to construct a parking deck as part of the Town Center project. These
bonds were first refinanced in 1992 and later refinanced in 1998 with COPs. The State Department of Finance has denied the repayment
of the COPs debt service from the RPTTF because the payments are pledged by lease rental payments required by the City. The COPs
were moved over to the General Fund in FY 2012/13.
Government Center Site Bond
Government Center Property. In 2001, variable rate certificates of participation (COPs) were issued to reimburse the City for the cost
of acquiring the property located at 505 West Olive. The property, known as the Sunnyvale Office Center, is adjacent to the Civic Center
and was purchased in anticipation of future space needs of the City. The 2001 COPs were insured by Ambac, a major bond insurer that
has been significantly downgraded by the rating agencies. As a result, interest rates on the 2001 COPs increased multiple times.
In late FY 2008/09, the City issued Variable Rate Demand Refunding Certificates of Participation, Series 2009 A, to refund the 2001
COPs. The 2009 COPs are backed by an irrevocable bank letter of credit. City lease payments will reimburse the bank for monthly letter
of credit draws by the trustee to pay holders of the refunding COPS. The annual payments increase each year through the twenty-year
financial plan to account for potential interest rate increases over the long term. Debt service on this bond is financed by the interest on
the reserve fund of the COPs and rental revenue from outside tenants and City operations.

BUDGET GUIDE
UNDERSTANDING THE SUNNYVALE BUDGET
Sunnyvale’s Budget and Long-Term Financial Plan provides a framework for a unique budget document that presents both the
immediate short-term action plans and the long-term trends for the City. In this manner, the budget provides the reader with a
comprehensive view of the City’s current financial picture, staff assumptions for long-term trends, and the way we work to achieve
and maintain financial stability using those assumptions. The following elements contained in this document are integral to
understanding this year’s budget:

Twenty-Year Resource Allocation Plan & Financial Planning
The Budget Document presents a twenty-year financial plan for the City’s General Fund, as well as all other City funds. Twenty-year
financial plans for other City funds are grouped into four categories: Special Revenue Funds, Capital and Infrastructure Funds,
Enterprise Funds, and Internal Services and Other Funds. The General Fund is presented separately. It is the primary fund that
accounts for many of the largest revenues, such as Property Tax and Sales Tax, and the most visible City services, such as police, fire,
road maintenance, the library, and parks. For each category, detailed Fund Reviews are included before the Financial Plans. These
reviews provide a summary of the funds, including explanations of major components and new developments for the current budget.
The Twenty-Year Resource Allocation Plan (RAP, or the long term-financial plan) is the backbone of the City’s financial planning
process. Each long-term financial plan lays out the revenues and expenditures by fiscal year. The financial plans include the prior
year actual audited results and the current year budget, as well as projections for each of the coming twenty years. The City examines

67

its operating and project budgets in depth in alternating years. In addition, key factors are rigorously evaluated and updated annually.
On the revenue side, the current year budget is updated based on year-to-date revenue receipts. For ongoing revenues, staff works to
estimate the next two years as accurately as possible and then analyzes historical information, economic cycles, and factors that can
impact the revenue source, among other data, to project the revenue trend over the long term.
On the expenditure side, the operating budget is updated with Council-approved budget modifications that have occurred during the
fiscal year. If significant project budgets are anticipated to be spent in future fiscal years, estimated carryover of project funds will be
incorporated. All program budgets are rolled up annually by fund or sub-fund to the total amounts in the “Operations” line of the
financial plans. From that base, inflation factors are applied to expenditures. Inflation factors are developed for each category of
expenditures such as salaries, employee benefits, purchased goods and services, and equipment. Project budgets are also totaled
annually by fund and reflected in the “Projects” line of the financial plans. In addition, project operating costs, if applicable, are
shown separately on the financial plan.
A critical purpose of the long-term financial plan is its use as a tool for achieving and maintaining a structurally-balanced budget. A
fundamental part of the financial plans is that they are, by policy, balanced to the twentieth year. In order for the budget to be balanced, not
only must resources be available to meet requirements over the twenty-year planning period with all reserve requirements met per Council
Policy, but service levels must also not be impacted.
A balanced budget enables the City to maintain service levels over the twenty-year planning horizon by ensuring reserves are used
strategically. For example, a budget is not balanced for the long term when there are drawdown of reserves over a protracted length of
time. Conversely, the build-up of reserves to the detriment of service levels also does not portray a balanced budget. The objective in
utilizing a twenty-year planning horizon is to sustain service levels, in large part, by managing reserves so that reserve levels are increased
in good times and drawn down in difficult financial times. Further, the City’s budget policy dictates that one-time revenues should not be
used for ongoing expenditures, and all revenue estimates must be conservative, objective and reasonable.
The General Fund’s Budget Stabilization Fund is required by policy to be maintained at a minimum 15% of projected revenues for the first
two years of the twenty-year planning period. The purpose of the Budget Stabilization Fund is to allow for sustainable service level
fluctuations in the economy. By contrast, the General Fund Contingency Reserve can only be used for non-fiscal emergencies or disasters.
The General Fund Contingency Reserve is required to be maintained at 15% of operating costs in the first year of the twenty-year plan and
increased annually for projected increases in the Consumer Price Index.
The City’s balanced twenty-year plan allows decision makers to better understand the true impact of policy decisions, and effectively
requires that decisions made today include a guarantee that resources will be available to maintain services in the future. More importantly,

68

this methodology incorporates both short- and long-term perspectives for planning revenues, operating requirements, and capital
spending. It allows the cost of any policy decision to be measured in terms of long-range expenditure requirements, thereby raising
“red flags” in areas where financial conditions may be significantly different in the future.

Departmental Overviews
To help the reader understand the proposed two-year operating budget, departmental overviews provide the context for the services
and service levels provided. Leading off the section presenting each department’s program or set of programs, the departmental
overviews describe the organizational structure for service delivery, factors that informed the development of the operating budget
proposal, and significant changes in the proposed budget as compared to the current budget.
The departmental overviews also include performance and workload indicators for each of the programs managed by the department,
as well as budgeted headcount. The performance indicators represent the goals and results staff hopes to achieve with the resources
provided, while the workload indicators provide output and relevant statistical data. Additionally, they are linked to goals laid out in
the City’s Consolidated General Plan. These indicators help explain why services are provided and the impacts of the level at which
we provide them. As such, the indicators are an important component of the performance based budget structure.

Performance Based Operating Budget
Following the Departmental Overviews and Performance and Workload Indicators in the budget document are the City’s operating
budget reports. The presentation of these operating reports mirrors the City’s operating structure. It is organized into programs, or
services, and all expenditures are budgeted into activities, which break down the services into logical and manageable components.
Where appropriate, work products are budgeted for activities. As a result, the budget presents information on the services the City
provides, the cost of services and where logical, the planned amount of service. This budget structure focuses the City on identifying
and quantifying the value created by the efficient/effective provision of City services. Community members can clearly see what
services they are receiving and how much they cost, which also holds staff accountable.

Projects Budget
In the City of Sunnyvale, the term “project” refers to a non-operating activity. The City segregates each project into one of four
possible categories: Capital, Infrastructure, Special, and Outside Group Funding. Capital projects are major expenditures related to
construction, improvement or acquisition of capital assets. Infrastructure projects are inherently related to capital projects. After a
capital project is complete, the City has an asset that must be maintained through the operating budget until the asset reaches a point

69

where maintenance costs exceed renovation/replacement costs. An infrastructure project is developed in order to provide future funds
at the time that replacement or renovation is required. Special projects are one time only in nature and are set up to eliminate the
impact such costs would have on operating programs. For example, the cost of service study for refuse services would be a special
project. Outside group funding projects are essentially special projects; however, they are established to identify contributions made
to local community-based organizations.
Each project is identified individually in the budget document including its estimated costs over the next twenty years. Projects also
reflect anticipated outside revenues that will fund the project, such as grants and fees. In addition, project operating costs are
budgeted for those ongoing operating costs that will need to be included in future years upon completion of a given project.
Consideration of this information enables decision makers to evaluate the complete costs of proposed actions. This prevents the City
from adding assets or activities that are not sustainable over the long term.
The projects budget also includes unfunded projects, which are desirable or pose a liability in the long term but do not have identified
funding sources. In some cases, future grant funds may be available for all or a portion of the costs, but it is the City’s policy not to
recognize these revenue sources until they are actually available.
Projects related to long-range plans are also identified separately in their respective sections of the Projects Budget volume.
Specifically, projects related to Traffic & Transportation that are part of long-range plans are listed in the Traffic and Transportation
section of the Projects Budget volume.

70

BUDGET & FISCAL POLICIES
Two-Year Operating & Projects Budget
In recognition of the tremendous effort required to develop budgets, the City implemented a two-year operating budget in the early
1980’s. Although the City reviews its budget on an annual basis, it only prepares a detailed operating budget each biennium. This
means that operating budgets are not modified during the second year of the two-year budget. During the “off year” of the operating
budget, the projects budget is reviewed in detail.

Types of Expenditures
There are four major types of expenditures in the City’s spending plan: operating, equipment, capital improvements, and debt service.
Operating expenditures are related to a program’s base budget and include such items as general supplies, personnel costs, and
equipment rental. Major equipment expenses like computer hardware or city-owned cars are provided for separately under a general
services program. Capital improvements are expenditures which affect the economic vitality and quality of life in the community. A
good example would be construction of a park or resurfacing a city street. Debt service allows an improvement to be made when it is
needed rather than being delayed until funds are accumulated in the City’s treasury. Debt service is used like a credit card — buying
something today and paying for it over time. It may be used to finance, for example, a new community center building.

Cost Accounting
Cost accounting is a method of accounting that gathers together all the elements of cost incurred to accomplish a purpose, carry on an
activity, or complete a unit of work. By using this financial technique, the City is able to assess the true cost of providing a service.
The City’s internal users of information management, fleet and equipment, and buildings are assessed rental rates through their
programs for the use and eventual replacement of services and equipment. Employee benefits such as leave usage, retirement, and
insurances also are recovered by charging the programs that use personnel services. The City also uses an allocation system to
distribute administrative costs for services provided by departments such as Finance and Human Resources.

71

Basis of Budgeting
“Basis of budgeting” refers to the method used to recognize revenues and expenditures in the budget. For the City of Sunnyvale, the
basis of budgeting is the same basis used for accounting. The modified accrual basis is followed in the Governmental and Agency
Funds including the General Fund and special revenue funds like the Park Dedication Fund. Under this basis, revenues are recognized
when they become “susceptible to accrual,” which means they are both measurable and available. Measurable means the amount of
the transaction can be determined.
The City considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the current fiscal year end for property tax and 90
days for other revenues, with the exception of the County back-fill (for the loss of sales tax and Motor Vehicle License Fees (VLF)
revenues) for which the City adopts a seven-month availability period so that total sales tax and VLF revenues would be most
consistent with revenues reported in years before the State sales tax flip and VLF swap. Expenditures generally are recorded when a
liability is incurred except for debt service expenditures, which are recorded when payment is due.
Intergovernmental revenues (primarily grants) that are received as reimbursement for specific purposes or projects are recognized
based on when the related expenditures are recorded. Intergovernmental revenues which have virtually unrestricted purpose and are
revocable only for failure to meet prescribed compliance requirements are reflected as revenues at the time of receipt or earlier if
availability criteria are met.
The accrual basis is used in the proprietary funds, which include enterprise funds and internal service funds. Revenues are recognized
when earned and expenses are recognized when the related liabilities are incurred.

Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR)
The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is prepared according to “generally accepted accounting principles” (GAAP).
The City prepares its budget in accordance with GAAP with the following exceptions:


Loans requiring the use of current resources need to be budgeted as expenditures; in the CAFR, the disbursement of loans is
treated as a balance sheet item.



Appropriated budgets are not always needed for all of the City’s funds. For example, a budget is not appropriated for the advance
refunding of bonds because the resulting bond proceeds are deposited into escrow accounts and are considered restricted assets.

72



Principal payments on long-term debt within the enterprise funds are applied to the outstanding liability in the CAFR, while such
items are treated as expenses in the budget.



Capital outlay within enterprise funds and internal service funds are capitalized as fixed assets in the CAFR, in contrast to their
treatment as expenses in the budget.



The budget does not record depreciation expenses.



GAAP requires the reporting of investments at fair value. Because the City’s policy is to hold investments to maturity, the
changes in fair value are not reflected in the budget.

The CAFR shows fund expenditures and revenues on both a GAAP and budget basis for comparison purposes.

Budgetary Policy & Control
When the annual budget is adopted the City follows procedures that enact its policies. These procedures involve the City
management, employees, the public, boards and commissions, and the City Council throughout the year. These interactions between
policy and planning culminate in the establishment of new or revised General Plan goals and objectives. The budget must implement
the policies contained in the General Plan. Therefore, both must be synchronized completely. The City operates on a July 1 through
June 30 budget year. The budget schedule is detailed in a separate section below, which includes these interactions between policy
and planning.
The City’s budget is very detailed, ensuring that the City Council as the governing body is fully informed and in control of all aspects
of the City’s financial activities. Information is itemized by fund, by department, and by project. The budget includes equipment costs,
operating costs, and debt service costs, as well as capital, infrastructure, and special projects for the ensuing budget year. The budget
also contains detailed long-term financial plans with projections for expenditures, revenues, and reserves for an additional nineteen
years.
During the budget year, for governmental and agency funds, the City Manager is authorized to reappropriate budgeted amounts
between programs that are financed by the same fund and within the same department. Council approval is required if the
reappropriation exceeds the thresholds outlined below:

73

Annual Program
Budget

Reappropriation Threshold

Maximum
Reappropriation
Threshold (Annual)

> $500,000

$100,000 or 5%, whichever is greater

$250,000

< $500,000

$50,000 or 50%, whichever is less

$50,000

Council approval also is required for proprietary funds and internal services funds if the expenditures for the fiscal year exceed actual
revenues plus the planned, annualized appropriation from Reserves.
Budgets are legally adopted for all governmental funds except for the Special Assessment Debt Service Fund. The Special
Assessment Debt Service Fund does not have an adopted budget because the City is only required to make debt service payments in
the event of a property owner’s default. Budgets are also adopted legally for all proprietary funds. Formal budgets are employed as a
management control device for all funds in which a budget has been adopted. However, it serves as the primary means of spending
control for the General Fund, special revenue funds, debt service funds, and capital project funds.
Budgets can be modified during the fiscal year if needed because of a legislative mandate, City Council or City Manager directive, or
an unanticipated change in service level. Budget modifications cover one fiscal year only and must be approved by City Council.
This allows management to focus on changes to the base budget during the next budget process.

Citizen Participation
Citizens have an opportunity to participate in the Twenty-Year Resource Allocation planning process through avenues such as
Council-appointed boards and commissions, study sessions, and public hearings. Each winter, citizens are provided the opportunity to
speak on proposed study and budget issues at a formal public hearing. Citizens may attend study sessions dealing with upcoming
Council issues, as well as Council meetings which are scheduled on Tuesdays throughout the year. At the Council meetings, citizens
are given an opportunity to speak during the public hearing period. In addition, a formal public hearing on the Recommended Budget
is held annually in June.

Budget Calendar
The City’s annual budget development process begins in September each year with the initial planning of the development cycle and
culminates with the adoption of the budget by the City Council in June. In January, the City Council specifically discusses important

74

fiscal issues which may have short-term or long-term effects on how the City provides and maintains services to its citizens and
customers. Consistent with City Charter, no later than 35 days prior to June 30th the City Manager submits a Recommended Budget to
the City Council. The City Council holds a workshop on the Recommended Budget, which is open to the public. In June of each year
the City Council also holds a public hearing, required by the City Charter. Prior to June 30 of each year, the budget as modified by the
City Council is legally enacted by adoption of a budget resolution.
Below is a high-level calendar detailing key steps throughout the process. As noted previously, the City of Sunnyvale alternates years
for developing operating budgets and projects budgets. The calendar below represents key milestones that take place regardless of
whether the budget being developed is an operating budget or a projects budget. It also incorporates critical elements of budgetary
policy and control, as discussed in a separate section above.

7.1B Revenue Policies
B.1: Revenue Base
B.1.1.

The City will maintain a diversified and stable revenue base, not overly dependent on any land use or external
funding source.

B.1.2.

Taxes levied by the City will be used for the purpose of financing services performed for the common benefit.

B.1.3.

Taxes should be held at their lowest possible level, while maintaining Council-approved service levels.

B.1.4.

When considering a new tax or revenue source or an increase in an existing tax or revenue source, the following
criteria should be considered:

79

-

Community/voter acceptance
Competitiveness with surrounding communities
Efficiency of revenue collection and enforcement
Effectiveness in generating sufficient revenues in the short- and long-term to justify its establishment
Enhancement of revenue diversity to promote stability and provide protection from downturns in business
cycles
- Equity/Fairness in distribution of the revenue burden on various segments of the community
B.1.5.

Reliance on any restricted and/or inelastic sources of revenue will be avoided.

B.1.6.

One-time revenues should not be used for ongoing expenditures.

B.1.7.

Revenue should not be targeted for a specific program, unless a revenue source has been established for the sole
purpose of financing a particular expenditure.

B.1.8.

Potential new revenue sources will be investigated periodically to ensure that the City’s revenue base is stable and
diversified.

B.1.9.

Donations, contributions, and sponsorships may be accepted if they are in accordance with City policy and General
Plan priorities.

B.2: Revenue Forecasting and Monitoring
B.2.1.

All revenue estimates must be conservative, objective and reasonable.

B.2.2.

Revenue forecasts should be based on detailed information regarding historical performance and economic conditions
whenever possible.

B.2.3.

At least ten years data for all tax revenue sources will be maintained.

B.2.4.

B.4: Grants and Intergovernmental Assistance
B.4.1.

The use of intergovernmental grant assistance for routine programs will be discouraged. Intergovernmental grants

expand a service in such a way as to require the substitution of local funds to continue part or all of the service once
intergovernmental assistance ends.

B.4.2.

Intergovernmental assistance may only be used to establish or expand a program when the Twenty-Year Resource
Allocation Plan meets the following conditions:
- The program is eliminated at the end of the intergovernmental funding period, or

completion of intergovernmental funding

B.4.3.

- The objectives or goals of the City which will be achieved through use of the grant

81

-

The local match required, if any, plus the source of the local match
The increased cost to be locally funded upon termination of the grant

User fees should be used to recover the cost of services that benefit specific segments of the community.

B.5.2.

User fees should be reviewed and adjusted at least annually to avoid sharp changes.

B.5.3.

User fees and charges should not exceed the City’s full cost of providing the service.

B.5.4.

User fees should be established at a level which reflects the full cost of providing those services.

B.5.5.

The City Council may determine for any service whether a subsidy from the General Fund is in the public interest.

and to minimize future maintenance and replacement costs.

related to the City’s utilities shall be accounted for in the respective utility fund.

to ensure a reasonable time frame for projecting costs.

C.3.3

Improvements should be designed with the following goals: to maximize energy efficiency, require minimal
maintenance, create an efficient physical relationship for those working in the facility, provide adequate capacity for
the projected useful life, and to have the ability to accommodate future expansion with minimum remodeling costs.

▪▪ General Fund Revenues

GENERAL FUND
	
The General Fund is used by the City to account for all
financial resources except those required by law or practice to
be accounted for in another fund. It supports many of the most
visible and essential City services such as police, fire, road
maintenance, libraries, and parks and open space maintenance.
General government support functions are also included in
this fund, and their costs are apportioned through the use of
indirect administrative fees to other City funds. Because
the General Fund receives the preponderance of its revenue
from taxes, it has been the most affected by voter-approved
initiatives and State legislative actions. As a result of such
action over the past two decades, revenues to the General
Fund are significantly less than they would have otherwise
been. Additionally, the state of the regional economy has a
direct effect on the General Fund.
	
The General Fund has a very close relationship with several
other funds. Those funds are the Youth and Neighborhood
Services Fund, the Gas Tax Fund, the Internal Service Funds,
the Capital Projects Fund, and the Infrastructure Renovation
and Replacement Fund. In each case, the condition of these
funds has a direct bearing on the General Fund because the
General Fund is a significant source of financial support. The
relationship between these various funds, where appropriate,
will be discussed as a part of the General Fund, as well as in
the review of each of these individual funds.
		

Revenue Estimation Methodology
All revenue assumptions and projections are reviewed and
revised each fiscal year. Further, considerable analysis is
undertaken to identify the key elements that impact our
major revenue sources so that the projection methodology
is as reliable as possible over the long-term. Historical data
underscores the fact that a significant swing in revenues can
occur due to economic cycles, as these cycles have produced
very different revenue yields to the City in a number of major
categories. Projecting revenues based on the high point of the
economic cycle could overstate the City’s financial position
significantly for future years and result in spending patterns
that cannot be sustained. Conversely, projecting revenues
from the lowest point of the economic cycle could understate
the long-term financial position of the City and cause
unnecessary service reductions.
	
Each revenue source has its unique characteristics that have
been used to make projections. In general, actual revenue
data and trend data for each major source are used to
calculate projections for the next two years. For the balance
of the financial plan, however, projections are based on the
history of each revenue, modified for present circumstances.
Following the adoption of each long-term financial plan, the
major revenue sources are monitored throughout the budget
year to detect any change in patterns or circumstances.

137

decline by 1% in FY 2013/14. Initial estimates forecasted
modest growth. As a result, the updated FY 2013/14 estimate
is projected to be lowered by approximately $2.5 million.
Utility Users Tax/Franchise Fees are expected to be up slightly
from FY 2012/13.
	
Our projections for FY 2014/15 and beyond vary based on
the revenue source. Transient Occupancy Tax, historically
a very volatile revenue source driven by business travel,
is currently tracking at an elevated level and our projection
for FY 2014/15 reflects a continuation of this for two more
years, with modest growth based on historical average room
rates and occupancy factored in thereafter. Developmentrelated revenue is included in the General Fund projection
in FY 2013/14. However, all Development-related revenues
with the exception of Construction Tax, will move into the
new Enterprise Development Fund for FY 2014/15 and will
be discussed in that section. Property Tax is projected to
experience healthy growth over the next three years before
growth returns to more historical levels. Sales Tax is expected
to be flat, with very modest growth going forward. Utility
Users Tax/Franchise Fees are expected to show a modest
increase in FY 2014/15 and then grow at an inflation factor
moving forward.
	
Total General Fund revenue is projected to be down 2.8% in
FY 2014/15. However, this does not reflect the true picture
of overall revenue as Development-related revenue is shifted
to a new fund. With Development-related revenues, one-time

General Fund Major Revenue Sources
Five key sources generate over 77% of the City’s General
Fund revenues (excluding property sale proceeds). These
sources are Property Tax, Sales Tax, Transient Occupancy
Tax, Utility Users Tax/Franchise Fees, and Developmentrelated taxes and fees. FY 2012/13 results for these top five
sources were mixed. Property Tax and Transient Occupancy
Tax ended the prior year up from FY 2011/12, while Sales
Tax, Development-related revenue, and Utility Users Tax
each decreased. The FY 2013/14 Adopted Budget projected
moderate growth for Sales Tax, Transient Occupancy Tax, and
Utility Users Tax, over expected FY 2012/13 results. Modest
decreases were projected for Property Tax and Developmentrelated taxes and fees; however the projections were still well
above historical average. The shortfall of Sales Tax revenues
in FY 2012/13, along with the general volatility of most of
these revenue sources, are key issues in the revenue projection
efforts and will be discussed in detail below.
	
As FY 2013/14 has unfolded, Transient Occupancy Tax
and Development-related taxes and fees continue to exceed
expectations, with Transient Occupancy Tax revenues
expected to finish the year up 12.5% over FY 2012/13, and
Development-related taxes and fees down only slightly from
the record highs of the last two years. Property Tax revenues
are also expected to exceed expectations, with the updated
projection to be 1.5% over the initial 3% estimated growth.
On the Sales Tax side, the City is projecting revenues to

138

events and transfers excluded, FY 2013/14 revenues are projected to be $130 million. FY 2014/15 revenue, with the same
exclusions, is projected to be $130.7 million, a 0.5% increase.
The table below reflects projected sources of General Fund revenues for FY 2014/15 and compares those sources with the FY
2013/14 revised projections. Actual revenues for FY 2011/12 and FY 2012/13 are also included.

to backfill a portion of the State’s obligation for school
funding. This original “ERAF shift” results in an annual loss
to the City of Sunnyvale of approximately $9 million.

Property Tax
Property Tax represents the largest source of General Fund
revenue, estimated to be about 37% of all General Fund
revenues in FY 2014/15. For each dollar of Property Tax
paid by property owners in Sunnyvale, approximately $0.17
is now allocated to the City of Sunnyvale. This amount is up
from the previous $0.13, which the City received prior to the
implementation of the VLF Swap discussed below.

In FY 2004/05 and FY 2005/06 the State shifted an additional
$4.1 million over those two years from Sunnyvale Property
Tax to the ERAF as part of a solution to its ongoing budget
crisis (ERAF III). Also included in the State Budget deal
with local governments in FY 2004/05 was a permanent
redistribution of two of the City’s revenue sources. Under this
agreement, the Vehicle License Fee (VLF) rate for cities was
permanently reduced from 2% to 0.65%. For FY 2004/05,
the VLF that the City would have gotten at the 2% rate was
calculated and this amount was added to our Property Tax
base through transfers from the ERAF. In FY 2005/06, the
City began to receive our portion of VLF revenues at the
lower rate of 0.65%, while the Property Tax base was adjusted
to reflect its new, permanent base.

The City’s Property Tax revenue consists of several
categories. Secured Tax, which represents the vast majority
of the overall Property Tax, is the tax on real property and
the structures on that real property. Unsecured Tax represents
the tax on appurtenances such as furniture, machinery, and
equipment. Supplemental Tax is the result of reassessing the
value of real property when there is a change of ownership
or new construction is completed after the official lien date.
Other sources of Property Tax revenue come from Unitary
Tax, which is assessed by the State Board of Equalization
on property such as utilities or railroad lines, and Tax
Delinquencies.

Overall FY 2014/15 Property Tax revenues are expected to be
up when compared to FY 2013/14, continuing the growth seen
in the prior year. The outlook for Property Tax is positive,
with expectations of increased assessed valuations in both the
residential and commercial sectors driving revenue growth.

Property Tax has also been the revenue most affected by
voter initiatives and legislative actions. With approval of
Proposition 13 in 1978, Property Tax revenues were reduced

early 1990s, the State legislature permanently shifted a larger
portion of the Property Tax to schools. This shift was made to
the State’s Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF)

Secured Tax, which accounts for approximately 87% of total
Property Tax revenue, has experienced strong growth in FY
2013/14 and is expected to increase significantly over the
next two fiscal years. The residential market is expected to
continue to be strong with an additional year of growth at the

140

accelerated rate that the City has experienced in FY 2013/14.
Accelerated growth is also expected in the short term for the
commercial sector. Substantial assessed value has been added
to the City’s Property Tax roll in FY 2013/14, and the City
is forecasting continued strong demand for commercial leases
and a significant increase of commercial building square
footage in Sunnyvale. Overall, the combined residential and
commercial growth rate is expected to be 4.8% in FY 2014/15,
5.1% in FY 2015/16, and 4.1% in FY 2016/17. After that,
growth is expected to continue at the historical average of
approximately 4% annually. This factors in 2% growth and
the maximum 2% increase in CPI.

issue has not been resolved. Based on a worst case scenario,
the General Fund’s long-term financial plan reflects a $13.9
million payment to the State, with the City receiving its share
of the distribution to the taxing agencies of that payment,
which is expected to be $1.8 million.
Two other important elements of Property Tax revenue are
the Unsecured Property Tax and Supplemental Property
Tax rolls. Unsecured Property Tax revenue increased in FY
2012/13 due to the strong demand for commercial and office
space in Sunnyvale. This revenue source remains strong in
FY 2013/14, up 1.3% to $2.68 million, before returning to
the historical average of $2.5 million for FY 2014/15, and
growing modestly from there.

In addition, the Secured Property Tax base has been increased
with the dissolution of the RDA. After the payment of
enforceable obligations, the former property tax increment
will be distributed as Property Tax to all applicable taxing
agencies, and $31.1 million has been programmed into the
long-term financial plan to account for the City’s expected
allocation. In FY 2014/15, the distribution of the former
property tax increment is expected to provide $1.2 million in
revenue to the City. This source of Property Tax revenue is
impacted by one significant non-recurring item. Under normal
circumstances, the City expects to receive a distribution
of approximately $1.2 million, however an additional $1.8
million is forecasted in FY 2015/16. This is the City’s share
of $14 million in loan repayments it had previously received
from the RDA that the State Department of Finance has
determined the City was not eligible to receive. As of the
publishing of the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget, this

The Supplemental Property Tax roll reflects properties that are
sold or transferred after the official lien date. Supplemental
assessments pick up the higher or lower value on the property
immediately by using a floating lien date, and the added or
reduced assessed value is placed on a separate Property Tax
bill. Revenue from the supplemental roll is dependent strictly
upon timing of sales and thus is difficult to forecast. Another
factor that makes this revenue source difficult to forecast is
the fact that it is a pooled revenue at the County level. All
Supplemental Property Tax collected by the County is allocated
to the cities based on a formula and not on transactions within
each jurisdiction. As such, the significant valuation declines
and foreclosures in other parts of the county have impacted
the City of Sunnyvale’s Supplemental Property Tax revenues.
Over the past several years, this revenue source has recovered

141

from a record low in FY 2010/11 of $175,000. The City
received $625,000 in FY 2011/12, $598,000 in FY 2012/13,
and is projected to receive $692,000 for FY 2013/14. While
Supplemental Property Tax is expected to increase to the
historical average, beginning in FY 2014/15 the City will be
impacted by an updated allocation basis for the Supplemental
tax calculation from the County. Our projection revises the
historical average of $1.05 million down by 25% to prepare
for the base adjustment, and forecasts Supplemental Property
Tax revenues to be $788,000 in FY 2014/15, and then increase
modestly from there throughout the remainder of the longterm plan.

1096, which was the law implementing the Triple Flip and
the VLF swap, was incorrect as it related to administrative
fees. Specifically, the law stated the counties could collect
actual costs to administer the Triple Flip and the VLF swap,
but it did not state that the additional Property Tax revenue
received by the cities could be counted toward the standard
administrative fee.
The City of Sunnyvale received a $1.2 million refund in FY
2012/13 for the inflated administrative fee it paid for the
past six years. More importantly, the baseline Property Tax
Administrative Fee for our 20-year plan has been reduced
significantly. However, for FY 2013/14, the County estimates
that administrative fees will increase 9% due to increased
costs for the Assessors’ Office. In addition, the County is
forecasting an additional 8% increase in administrative fees in
FY 2014/15. Factoring this information, the City projects the
FY 2013/14 administrative fee to be $446,000, increasing 8%
in FY 2014/15 to $481,680.

Another component of the City’s Property Tax is the
administrative fee the County of Santa Clara charges to
collect and distribute Property Tax. In FY 2006/07, counties
throughout the State of California, including the County
of Santa Clara, significantly increased their administrative
fee for collecting and distributing Property Tax revenues to
cities. State Revenue and Tax Code allows counties to collect
an administrative fee equivalent to 1% of collections, and
because two State actions, the “Triple Flip” and the Vehicle
License Fee (VLF)/Property Tax swap, essentially increased
the amount of Property Tax going to the cities, the counties
asserted the significant increase in the administrative fee was
warranted.

Sales and Use Tax
Sales and Use Tax (Sales Tax) represents the second largest
source of revenue to the General Fund. Sales Tax is expected
to make up 21% of budgeted revenues in FY 2014/15. Sales
and Use Tax also represents one of the General Fund’s most
volatile revenue sources, with drastic swings over the past
decade. Sales Tax was the General Fund’s largest revenue
source in FY 2000/01, constituting 32% of total revenue at
$36.3 million. Following the bust in the technology industry,
Sales Tax revenue plummeted to $22.8 million by FY 2002/03.

Widely challenged by cities throughout California, the issue
came to resolution during FY 2012/13, as the California
Supreme Court ruled that the counties’ interpretation of SB

142

Sales Tax rebounded over the following four fiscal years,
reaching $30.9 million in FY 2006/07, then dropped 4% in FY
2007/08 as the initial impact of the Great Recession began to
be felt. This revenue source continued to slide in FY 2008/09,
finishing at $25.1 million, before rebounding again in recent
years. FY 2010/11 revenues of $29.2 million were a 15%
increase over the previous year, and FY 2011/12 revenues of
$30.3 million were a 3.8% increase over the previous year.
However, in FY 2012/13 the trend reversed again, with Sales
Tax revenue declining 1% to $30 million.

the increases have added a total of one-half cent to the Sales
Tax. Measure B, which was approved by voters in 2008,
added an eighth-cent Sales Tax to support the BART extension
and became effective July 1, 2012. This additional eighthcent will be effective for 30 years. In 2012, voters approved
two additional Sales Tax measures. One was Proposition 30,
a quarter-cent increase to the statewide base Sales Tax rate.
This addition became effective on January 1, 2013 and is set
to end on December 31, 2016. The other was Measure A, an
eighth-cent increase to the portion of Sales Tax the County
of Santa Clara receives for general County purposes. This
addition became effective April 1, 2013 and is set to end
on March 31, 2023. It is important to note that the City of
Sunnyvale is not a beneficiary of either of these increases and
continues to receive only 1% of all taxable sales.
Sales and Use Tax is composed of two different types - general
retail sales and business-to-business sales. In Sunnyvale, as
well as some other Silicon Valley cities, an unusually high
proportion of overall Sales Tax has traditionally been businessto-business in nature. This sector currently constitutes about
40% of our aggregate, as opposed to the statewide average of
approximately 17%. This makes our Sales Tax much more
complicated and difficult to predict because it is often onetime in nature.
	
Specific year-over-year growth projections are developed by
dividing Sales Tax receipts into five major categories that
have similar economic characteristics: Business and Industry,
General Consumer Goods, Autos and Transportation, County

The graph above shows how Sales Tax dollars are distributed
within Santa Clara County. The State receives the largest
share of the eight and three-quarter cents per dollar of sales,
while cities receive only one cent of the rate. There have been
three increases to Sales Tax implemented in recent years, and

Pool, and Other. The Other category includes Restaurants and
Hotels, Building and Construction, Fuel and Service Stations,
and Food and Drugs. As can be seen from the following graph
listing Sunnyvale’s Sales Tax receipts by sector between 2001
and 2013, each category has a unique pattern:

challenging. As previously noted, in FY 2006/07, Sales Tax
reached $30.9 million. Two years later, by FY 2008/09, the
Great Recession had taken its toll and Sales Tax had dropped
to $25.1 million, a 19% loss over two years. Sales Tax has
recovered to nearly FY 2006/07 levels, as revenues of just
over $30 million were received in FY 2012/13.
	
Our revised Sales Tax estimate for FY 2013/14 is $29.8
million, down slightly from the prior year. This decrease was
caused by a negative adjustment in the Business and Industry
category that was the result of a state audit. This adjustment
will impact Sales Tax revenue over two years. Excluding the
one-time adjustment, the sales tax base is projected to be up
1.3% in FY 2013/14. Modest growth is anticipated in the
upcoming years, a function of sustained high activity in the
Building/Construction and Auto/Transportation categories, as
well as from increased projections on revenue received from
the County pool. Pooled revenues are expected to increase
as a percentage of the City’s overall Sales Tax revenue as
e-commerce continues to become a larger and larger part of
the economy. When transactions occur online for Sales Taxeligible purchases, the 1% share received by cities instead
goes into a County pool for distribution. For example, if a
Sunnyvale resident goes to Target in Sunnyvale and purchases
a television, the City receives 1% of the sale price in Sales Tax
revenue. If that same Sunnyvale resident buys that television
off of Target’s website, the 1% of the sale price instead goes
to the County pool for distribution to all agencies, as the
revenue from online purchases is tracked to the county where
the customer is located rather than to a more precise location

due to the lack of detail in the seller’s tax return. The County
pool is distributed based on each jurisdiction’s share of total
taxable sales. For the last reporting period, Sunnyvale’s share
of the pool was 7.9%. This increasing trend not only makes
Sales Tax revenue more-and-more difficult to project, but it
also means that a larger part of this significant revenue source
has little to do with activity in Sunnyvale.
	
Because of the volatility of this revenue source, staff has
built in more conservative growth projections than prior year
budgets. Sales Tax revenues are expected to be slightly up
in FY 2014/15 at $30.2 million. The City expects to see
continued recovery in the economy, especially in the local
area, however, the increase in Sales Tax revenues will be
offset by the state audit adjustment mentioned above. Growth
is anticipated at a normal rate in FY 2015/16, reaching $31.2
million, a 3.3% increase over the FY 2014/15 projection.
In total, the revised projections pull $42 million out of the
fund over the twenty-year plan. Growth projections past FY
2015/16 are very modest, averaging 2.7% annually through
FY 2023/24, which is only slightly above the inflation
expectation during that time period. While it is not possible
to predict the next slowdown or how that slowdown will
impact Sales Tax revenues, the projections for future revenues
reflect overall positive growth with the expectation that some
years of growth will be offset by losses in other years due to
economic fluctuations.
	
Further, following completion of the Town Center project, it
is anticipated that the City will receive additional Sales Tax

revenue of approximately $1.5 million per year. We begin
showing a portion of these funds starting in FY 2016/17, with
the full $1.5 million being recognized in FY 2017/18.
	
Utility Users Tax and Franchise Fees
Utility Users Tax (UUT) and Franchise Fees represent the
third largest source of General Fund revenue, generating
about 10% of the total for FY 2014/15. Historically, these two
revenue categories have been combined because one of the
primary sources of revenue for both is the sale of electricity
and gas. The City’s UUT rate is 2% on electricity, gas, and
intrastate telephone providers, which is lower than the 3.7%
average of those cities in Santa Clara County which have
UUT. It is also lower than the UUT rate of 3.6% for Santa
Clara County when weighted by population and significantly
lower than the statewide average of 6%.
Approximately 64% of UUT revenue is derived from the sale
of electricity, 26% is related to intrastate telephone usage, and
10% is derived from the sale of gas.
The single largest component of UUT revenues is the electric
rates charged by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). After
experiencing a decline in FY 2012/13, staff anticipates FY
2013/14 revenues for this source to increase 6.3%, in-line
with revenues from FY 2010/11. Staff researched the cause
for the drop in FY 2012/13, including speaking with the
City’s liaison from PG&E. While a specific cause was not
able to be identified, it was assumed that this will not be a
continuing trend. This revenue source is expected to grow

145

based on a factor that considers rising prices and increased
utilization. However, the baseline revenue amount was
reduced in comparison to the baseline set for the FY 2013/14
Adopted Budget. This adjustment to the baseline is to
ensure conservatism in long term revenue growth given the
increased emphasis of energy efficiency in buildings and new
development as a counter-weighting factor when considering
the impact of new development to this revenue source. Staff
will continue to closely monitor UUT and will continue to be
in communication with PG&E to better understand the overall
trends that can affect UUT revenue related to PG&E’s sale of
electricity.

2%. The City’s other main franchise agreements are with
our cable television providers and Specialty Solid Waste.
For FY 2014/15, Franchise Fees are projected to increase by
approximately 2% over the current FY 2013/14 projection.
This represents a slight increase in revenues from nearly all of
the companies with which the City has a franchise agreement.
Projections for future years include modest year-over-year
increases for this aggregate revenue source.
Development-related Revenues
The fourth largest revenue source in the General Fund in
FY 2013/14 is Development-related revenue. As indicated
above, this revenue is being moved into the newly created
Development Enterprise Fund. Construction Tax is the only
component of Development-related revenue that will remain
in the General Fund because it is a tax. Construction tax
returns have been very strong, an indication of the high level
of development activity that the City has sustained for three
consecutive years. For FY 2013/14, Construction tax revenue
is expected to be approximately $2.6 million. We anticipate
that this historically high level will cool off, with a decreased
but still elevated amount estimated for FY 2014/15 and the
7-year historical average of $1.7 million planned, beginning
in FY 2015/16.

The City is expecting to receive approximately $1.67 million
in FY 2013/14 from UUT on intrastate telephone usage. This
is roughly flat from the $1.69 million received in FY 2012/13.
The long-term viability of this revenue source is a concern.
Despite explosive growth in the overall telecommunications
industry, the City is not expected to benefit from increased
UUT revenue, as the bulk of the growth is related to areas
that are not included in the UUT calculation, such as data
transmission. As a result, revenue projections for FY 2014/15
and beyond reflect the continued degradation of this revenue
source at a rate of -0.5% annually.

Transient Occupancy Tax

The City receives a one-time franchise payment from
PG&E each year which represents approximately 39% of all
Franchise Fee revenue. The PG&E franchise rate is 1% of
gross receipts. Statewide, franchise rates range from .5% to

Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) represents the fifth largest
revenue source of the General Fund, constituting nearly 7% of
the total projected revenue for FY 2014/15.
	

146

TOT revenue is expected to finish at nearly $10.1 million
in FY 2013/14. This represents a 12.4% increase over FY
2012/13. This increase in TOT revenue is the result of two
factors. Effective midway through the fiscal year, on January
1, 2014, the TOT tax rate increased from 9.5% to 10.5%.
The second driving factor is business-related travel, the core
business of Sunnyvale’s hotels, which remains at a high
level. As the economic recovery has continued and business
travel has picked up, Sunnyvale hotels have benefited from
increasing room rates and occupancy rates, which has
positively impacted the City’s TOT revenues.
	
Projections for future years consider a number of factors,
including room rates, occupancy rates, and three new hotels
that are expected to begin generating revenue. One hotel,
which had been included in prior year projections, is expected
to begin generating revenue during FY 2014/15. When all of
these factors are considered together, FY 2014/15 is expected
to be up 5.3% over FY 2013/14. Projections for both FY
2015/16 and FY 2016/17 reflect slight drops in room and
occupancy rates to set them at a more sustainable level based
on historical results. Offsetting this reduction in room and
occupancy rates in FY 2016/17 is the inclusion of the two other
new hotels into the long-term plan. When fully operational,
these two new hotels are expected to bring in approximately
$1.1 million in net new TOT revenue annually. Beyond FY
2016/17, growth is expected to be relatively steady, reflecting
primarily flat occupancy rates with modest annual increases in
room rates. This revenue is volatile due to it being correlated

with business related travel, and the modest growth forecasted
reflects that there will be ups and downs.
	

Other Revenue Highlights
The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget includes certain other
revenue sources which warrant some discussion.
	
Inter-Fund Revenues
Inter-Fund Revenues are primarily loan repayments to the
General Fund from the other funds, including the utility
funds. Year-to-year fluctuations in this revenue source are
expected, as loan repayment schedules are not always on
fixed amortization periods and often change based on cash
considerations. For instance, the Inter-Fund Revenue in FY
2011/12 and FY 2012/13 reflect the loan repayments from the
RDA fund that have been eliminated with the dissolution of
the RDA.
	
Service Fees
This category includes revenue collections from fees charged
for services provided by City operations. The majority of
revenue in this category comes from the Recreation Division
in the Department of Library and Community Services, the
Community Development Department, the Department
of Public Works and the Department of Public Safety. The
high level in FY 2012/13 actuals and FY 2013/14 projected
revenue is due to the strong Development-related results. For

147

million in FY 2014/15) the sale of the homes the City owns in
the downtown area ($2.1 million in FY 2016/17), and the sale
of the margarine plant ($11.5 million in FY 2017/18) when
the lease is set to expire.

FY 2014/15, fees related to development activities are not
included in the General Fund.
	
Other Revenues
The Other Revenues category includes a variety of revenues,
including some of our smaller taxes like Business License Tax,
Proposition 172 Public Safety Sales Tax, and Real Property
Transfer Tax; grants and other funds from government
agencies; fines and forfeitures; interest income; and any other
miscellaneous revenue.

Revenues from sale of property, as one-time funds, are best
utilized for one-time capital needs. As such, these revenues
are segregated into the Capital Improvement Projects Reserve.
The sale proceeds from the Raynor Activity Center have
been programmed for the Lakewood Branch Library project
($11.5 million total, with $750,000 in FY 2014/15, and the
remainder in FY 2015/16 – FY 2017/18), and the Washington
Pool Expansion project ($2.37 million total, starting with
$371,423 in FY 2015/16, and the remainder in FY 2016/17
– FY 2017/18). The proceeds from the other sales have not
been appropriated to any projects.

In-Lieu Charges and Transfers
In-Lieu Charges and Transfers are primarily funds transferred
into the General Fund from other City funds to pay for the
cost of City-Wide administration, including the cost of the
Department of Finance, the Human Resources Department,
the Office of the City Manager, and the Office of the City
Attorney. The in-lieu charges were up 5.6% in FY 2013/14
from FY 2012/13. The FY 2014/15 projection reflects the
ongoing baseline for in-lieu transfers.
	
Sale of Property

▪▪ General Fund Expenditures
The most significant change for FY 2014/15 General Fund
budgeted expenditures is the move of approximately $7.5
million in operating expenditures out of the General Fund
and into the Development Enterprise Fund. All Developmentrelated revenues and expenditures are moved to the
Development Enterprise Fund to allow greater visibility
to the relationship of total Development-related costs and
offsetting fee-based revenue. The remaining General Fund
recommended expenditures and other requirements for FY
2014/15, including budget supplements, projects, lease
payments, equipment, and transfers total $157.3 million. Of

This revenue item reflects the sale of some of the City’s
property. There are three sales and one/long-term lease
of City property included in the General Fund’s long-term
financial plan for the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget.
These transactions include the long-term lease of the former
armory site by affordable housing providers ($7.4 million
in FY 2013/14), the sale of the Raynor Activity Center ($14

148

A portion of other General Fund operating costs also moved
over to the Development Enterprise. In addition, savings of
approximately $1.0 million annually are realized in the FY
2014/15 General Fund’s twenty-year plan. These are mainly
a result of reductions in election costs, contract/service
agreements, and legal services. Election cost savings of nearly
$390,000 are due to switching from an odd-year elections to
even-year elections, which was approved by voters at the
November 5, 2013 General Municipal Election. Contract/
service agreement savings of $225,000 are mainly due to
the elimination of budgeted costs for service agreements that
have not been spent. Lastly, approximately $113,000 in legal
services currently budgeted in the General Fund have moved
to the Liability and Property Fund and increased, as the recent
trend has shown increases in liability-related legal costs. The
budget is moved to reflect all liability-related costs in one
place.

this amount, operating expenditures are budgeted to be $132.7
million, which is slightly down from the revised FY 2013/14
operating budget of $133.8 million. However, considering
the expenditures moved out to the Development Enterprise,
expenditures are actually up over the prior year.
Personnel costs represent approximately 82% of the total
General Fund operating expenditures. To better represent
this in the General Fund’s twenty-year plan, operating costs
have been split into three categories: Operations - Safety
Salaries/Benefits, Operations – Misc. Salaries/Benefits, and
Operations - Other.
Both Miscellaneous and Safety Salaries/Benefits reflect a
significant increase over the twenty-year plan. While salary
assumptions have been maintained, employee benefit rates
have increased due to higher retirement and medical costs.
Retirement costs have increased primarily due to higher
employer contribution rates. These rates have increased
because of the recent CalPERS board adopted changes to
its actuarial and demographic assumptions used to calculate
employer contribution rates. Medical costs have increased due
to anticipated medical premium increases from geographic
pricing model changes by CalPERS and impacts from the
Affordable Care Act, as well as projected increases in the
number of City employees, as we are currently at historically
low headcount levels. This is further discussed in this volume
of the FY 2014/15 Budget Document under the Financial
Plans – Internal Service and Other Funds section.

It is important to note that each year a portion of the Public
Works Pavement Operations program, which is accounted for
in the General Fund, is supported by the Gas Tax Fund. The
amount that is used for this purpose varies depending upon
funds available and project requirements. In FY 2013/14 the
support was budgeted at $2.025 million, and this amount has
been held flat for FY 2014/15 through the remaining first nine
years of the plan. For the last ten years of the plan, it has
been decreased to $1.4 million annually. These pavement
operations costs are netted out from the General Fund
operations budget and reflected in the Gas Tax Fund.

149

Public Safety Recruitment Projects, Projects and Project
Administration, and Project Operating Costs reflect General
Fund expenditures related to capital, special, and Department
of Public Safety recruitment projects. The content of these
expenditures is discussed below in the General Fund Projects
section.

The FY 2014/15 General Fund Budget includes one-time
funding for six budget supplements and ongoing funding for
one budget supplement. Details on each of the supplements
are included in the Budget Supplement section in this volume
of the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget. The total one-time
expenditures budget for the six supplements in FY 2014/15
is $396,200; the ongoing supplement is budgeted at $10,200
annually.

The Equipment line item contains the appropriations for
equipment for the Department of Public Safety and the
Library and Community Services Department. These costs
are up due to the adjustment to and addition of some public
safety equipment. Specifically, the Department is replacing
two compressors used to fill oxygen bottles for fire fighters
that were not previously captured in the equipment fund.
Additionally, the funding for the replacement of tasers in the
last ten years of the plan moved over from the Asset Forfeiture
Fund, as revised revenue projections for the Asset Forfeiture
Fund are only able to absorb the partial replacement of tasers
in the first ten years.

Transfers to Other Funds reflects transfers from the General
Fund to other funds for operating and capital project purposes.
These include transfers to the Youth and Neighborhood
Services Fund for support of Columbia Neighborhood Center,
the Liability and Property Insurance Fund for the General
Fund’s share of claims and insurance, and the Capital and
Infrastructure Project Funds to cover project expenditures.
Approximately $6 million is budgeted to be transferred to the
new Development Enterprise Fund at the beginning of FY
2014/15. This is comprised of excess Development-related
revenues collected over original projected revenues in FY
2012/13 and FY 2013/14. Original projected Developmentrelated revenues remained in the General Fund through FY
2013/14, to coincide with Development-related operating
expenses also budgeted in the Fund for FY 2013/14. Other
major transfers budgeted for FY 2014/15 include a total
of $5.4 million to the Infrastructure Fund for the Pavement
Rehabilitation project and the Sidewalk, Curb, and Gutter
Replacement project, which has been increased by $1 million
to help work through some of the backlog of repairs over the
next two years. An additional $750,000 is planned to be

Lease payments in the amount of $1,202,750 are included in
the appropriation for FY 2014/15 as well. These payments
fulfill the City’s agreement with the former Redevelopment
Agency to pay lease payments equal to the annual debt service
on one of the downtown parking structures.

transferred to the Capital Projects Fund for the design work
on the Lakewood Branch Library Facility project. Through
FY 2017/18 an additional $10.75 million is programmed to
be transferred to fund the Lakewood Branch Library Facility
project, for a total of $11.5 million. As established in the
FY 2012/13 Budget, the long-term financial plan for the
General Fund reflects an annual transfer of $1.5 million for
investment in the City’s administrative infrastructure. These
funds are not set aside for a specific project or set of projects
at this point but will accumulate in the Infrastructure Fund
and be appropriated as projects are identified and prioritized.
$1.1 million is budgeted to be transferred to the Employee
Benefits Fund in FY 2014/15 to provide additional reserves
for the Retirement Benefits Sub-Fund to deal with increasing
contribution rate volatility.
	

on the number of recruitments and allows for better monitoring
and tracking of costs. It should be noted that the fixed costs
associated with this activity, which include management
oversight and other recruitment expenses, continue to be part
of the Public Safety Department operating budget.
	
There are five other special projects proposed for FY 2014/15
totaling approximately $435,000. These include $204,000 for
support of the financial system replacement project, $125,000
for Transportation and Traffic Services Staff Augmentation
($65,250 will be funded from the Development Enterprise
Fund), and $80,000 for Emergency Medical Dispatch First
Responder Incentive Funding (funded by the Santa Clara
County Emergency Medical Services Agency). There is
also one ongoing capital project for $10,200 a year for minor
building modifications included in the FY 2014/15 general
fund long term plan.
	
The FY 2014/15 Budget also contains $100,000 for Outside
Group Funding per Council policy. This amount is reflected
as an ongoing project cost through the entire twenty-year
financial plan.
	
Project Administration costs in the amount of $455,765 are
included in the General Fund appropriations for FY 2014/15.
This reflects costs of Public Works staff for design and
inspection of General Fund supported capital projects.
	
Often times, one-time capital projects will result in ongoing
operational costs. The Project Operating Costs line reflects

▪▪ General Fund Projects
	
The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget for the General
Fund includes $4.7 million for capital, special, and outside
group funding projects. The majority of this amount, nearly
$4.2 million in FY 2014/15, is in a special project for the
recruitment and training of sworn public safety officers. This
category of projects also represents the majority of General
Fund project expenditures over the twenty-year plan, with
$56.4 million budgeted for this purpose. The practice of
budgeting for the recruitment, selection, and training of new
public safety officers in a series of recurring special projects
rather than in the operating budget began in FY 2006/07. This
methodology allows expenditures to fluctuate each year based

uses. Most of the City’s reserves are established in accordance
with policies adopted by Council.

the future operating costs of budgeted projects. The first set
of operating costs arising from projects starts in FY 2015/16,
with the majority of the total being attributable to the Orchard
Gardens Park Expansion ($13,525) and the maintenance of
the pay parking systems downtown ($57,076). The ongoing
operating costs for the parking systems is expected to be
fully offset by revenues, which are also programmed into the
General Fund long-term financial plan. Another significant
increase to project operating costs comes in FY 2018/19,
when approximately $265,000 is added annually to cover the
ongoing costs of the Lakewood Branch Library. Additionally,
starting in FY 2019/20, approximately $116,000 is added
annually to cover the ongoing costs of the Washington Pool
Expansion project. These ongoing costs are expected to be
partially offset by increased revenues at Washington Pool
once expansion is complete.

The General Fund has five reserves that are contained in
the General Fund’s long-term financial plan under the subheading, Reserves. The first is the Contingencies Reserve.
By Council policy, this reserve must be equal to 15% of the
operating budget in the first year of the long-term plan, in
this case FY 2014/15, and then grow by the estimated change
in the Consumer Price Index in each subsequent year. Prior
to FY 2011/12, this reserve was set at 20% of General Fund
operational expenditures annually; however, Council changed
this reserve policy in 2011 to better reflect the intent and
potential uses of this reserve. It is important to note that this
reserve is not intended for normal unanticipated expenditures
and is instead to be used for non-fiscal emergencies or
disasters as determined by Council.
	
A second reserve in the General Fund mandated by Council
policy is the Budget Stabilization Fund. The Budget
Stabilization Fund functions to normalize service levels
through economic cycles. In essence, the intent is for this
fund to increase during periods of economic growth and to
be drawn down during the low points of economic cycles to
maintain stable service levels. Using the Budget Stabilization
Fund prevents us from adding services at the top of the
economic cycle that cannot be sustained while allowing us to
maintain Council-approved services levels during economic
downturns.

▪▪ General Fund Reserves
One of the most powerful aspects of multi-year financial
planning is its capability to recognize trends over time and
begin at an early point to consider the necessary steps to alter
the long-term forecasted position of a particular fund should
that appear necessary. The reserves contained in the General
Fund’s long-term financial plan play a pivotal role in the
City’s multi-year planning strategy.
	
The City has established reserves in the General Fund that
are restricted by prior policy or legal requirements to specific

152

2016/17, and is still projected to have a balance of $13.9
million in the twentieth year. This strikes the right balance
between ensuring the Budget Stabilization Fund is prudently
and thoughtfully funded throughout the long-term plan, but
that it is not so well-funded, especially in the latter years,
that the City is not maximizing its current service delivery
opportunities.

In August 2011, Council adopted a new policy governing
the balance of the Budget Stabilization Fund. This policy
requires that the Budget Stabilization Fund be maintained at
no less than 15% of total projected revenues for the first two
years of the 20-year plan and that it never go below $0 in any
year. For the FY 2014/15 Budget, the Budget Stabilization
Fund balance is 25% of revenues in FY 2014/15 and 22% in
FY 2015/16.

The third reserve in the General Fund is the Reserve for
Capital Improvement Projects. Originally entitled the Land
Acquisition Reserve, it was established in FY 1994/95 for
the purpose of purchasing land or property in the downtown
area with an emphasis on future income generation through
economic development. In the past, it was used to purchase
key parcels in the downtown area. In FY 2006/07 the reserve
name was changed to Reserve for Capital Improvement
Projects to reflect its expanded purpose. At the end of FY
2013/14, it is projected that the balance in this reserve will be
$15.4 million. This reflects the $8 million in the reserve as
of the end of FY 2012/13, as well as $7.4 million in proceeds
from the Armory Long Term Lease collected in FY 2013/14.
In FY 2014/15, another $14 million is projected from the
sale of the Raynor Activity Center (RAC). The majority of
the sale proceeds from the RAC will be spent on the new
branch library located at Lakewood Park ($11.5 million) and
advancing the schedule of the Washington Pool Expansion
Project by one year ($2.37 million). The reserve is expected
to increase with interest earnings and other sales of City
property, as noted earlier.

The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget continues to maintain
the short- and long-term balance. Over the twenty-year plan,
Total Available Resources are down $150 million, and Total
Expenditures are down by approximately the same amount,
or $153 million. This results in an essentially unchanged
budget stabilization reserve over the current budget, with
an increase of $3.8 million over the entire twenty-year plan.
This overall net position is primarily attributable to the move
of Development-related expenditures and revenues over to the
newly established Development Enterprise Fund. It is clear
that, over the long run, the General Fund has been subsidizing
Development-related activities. The direct operating costs
in the Development Enterprise Fund exceed the historical
average level of Development revenues collected, creating a
structural challenge for the Fund. Staff will work to closely
monitor the status of the new Fund on both the revenue and
expense side.
The Budget Stabilization Fund is also able to absorb the
impact of annually funding a parks worker and a dispatcher
starting in FY 2013/14 and a public safety officer in FY

153

The fourth reserve is the Development Enterprise Reserve.
Approximately $6 million is budgeted to be transferred from
the General Fund to the Development Enterprise Fund in
FY 2014/15 to fund Development-related activities. This
initial transfer represents the actual Development-related
revenue amounts collected over original revenue projections
for FY 2012/13 and FY 2013/14. Starting in FY 2014/15,
Development-related revenues are separately budgeted in the
Development Enterprise Fund.
	
Finally, the $13.9 million in Reserve for RDA Payment has
been set aside, pending final determination of payments made
to the City by the former Redevelopment Successor Agency
(RDA) prior to the dissolution of the former RDA. The
Successor Agency filed suit on May 23, 2013 challenging
the California Department of Finance’s (DOF) determination
that the City is not entitled to reimbursement for all payments
made related to the RDA’s financing obligation associated to
the Town Center development agreement. In response to this
petition, on September 4, 2013, Santa Clara County Counsel
on behalf of two affected taxing entities (the County Office
of Education and Fremont Union High School District) filed
a counter lawsuit against the Successor Agency, the City
and DOF. Since DOF’s determination on past payments
contradicts the findings of the Due Diligence Review and
the State Controller’s Asset Transfer Review, which both
determined that all payments made by the RDA to the City
prior to the dissolution of the former RDA were allowable,
the Successor Agency/City has not remitted the funds. Both
lawsuits were heard on April 25, 2014. To prepare for the

worst case scenario, the $13.9 million has been set aside and
resolution is anticipated in FY 2015/16.
	
Total Reserves in the General Fund increase or decrease
depending upon the relationship between Total Current
Resources and Total Current Requirements in the long-term
financial plan. Put simply, when revenues and resources are
greater than expenditures and transfers, money is put into the
reserves, and when expenses are higher, money is taken out.
The relationship between these can be seen at the bottom of
the plan in the rows marked Total Current Resources, Total
Current Requirements, and Difference. It should be noted that
Sunnyvale’s Reserves are actual funds rather than estimated
surpluses as is the case in the State Budget and some other
local jurisdictions. The advantage of funded reserves includes
the substantial interest earnings that are generated and added
to annual revenues.

Revenue projections are based on a number of factors,
including: current projects in the pipeline, historical
collections, total development square footage eligible to pay
this fee, and the current and projected per square foot Housing
Mitigation Fee. Due to the recent surge of development
activity in the City, $4.4 million in Housing Mitigation Fees
are expected in FY 2013/14, which represents a $2.4 million
increase over the $2.0 million originally budgeted. For FY
2014/15, revenue of $6.8 million is projected based on three
large, commercial development projects that have received
planning approval. Beginning in FY 2015/16 the revenue
projection is revised downward to the six-year average of $2.5
million per year. This historical average is notably higher
than the baseline used in the prior year due to the peak levels
in recent years. Over the twenty year plan, total revenue
from Housing Mitigation Fees is estimated to be up by $15.1
million over the prior year’s plan.

SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS
Special Revenue Funds are used to account for the proceeds
of specific revenue sources that are legally restricted or
earmarked for particular functions or activities of government.
In many cases, a Special Revenue Fund has been set up in
response to legal requirements established by a granting
agency or another level of government.

▪▪ Housing Fund
The Housing Fund is comprised primarily of Housing
Mitigation Fees and Below-Market-Rate Housing (“BMR”)
fees and fines. Expenditures are for operations related to
developing affordable housing, managing the City’s belowmarket-rate housing program, and for capital and special
projects that produce new affordable housing.

This revenue stream has allowed the City to assist a number
of important housing projects. The most notable of these
projects include the provision of over $5 million to assist in the
development of affordable apartments for seniors, and over $8
million for the development of 124 low-income rental housing
units at the City’s Armory site. Assistance to affordable
housing developments is provided in the form of a loan, with
payments amortized, deferred, or based on residual receipts
of the project’s anticipated operating cash flow. Interest rates

Housing Mitigation
Housing Mitigation Fees are development impact fees
paid by developers of large new employment-generating
developments, pursuant to S.M.C. 19.22.035, in order to
maintain or improve the City’s jobs/housing balance. These
fees are used to provide additional affordable housing in
the City. Housing Mitigation Fees and accrued interest are
maintained in this sub-fund of the Housing Fund.

vary and are set forth in each loan agreement. Payments
received on these loans are consistent with City policy for the
use of Housing Mitigation funds, and are deposited into this
fund and re-used for additional housing activities.

(Final Phase) project, $880,000 for the bridge loan to Habitat
mentioned above, and $500,000 for the 1st Time Homebuyer
Loans Program. The other notable project includes a $250,000
for a contribution to the Housing Trust Fund of Santa Clara
County. In FY 2014/15 there is $1.0 million budgeted for the
Morse Court Rental Rehabilitation project.

By the end of FY 2013/14, the Housing Mitigation Program
will receive a $748,000 loan repayment on a loan made to
Habitat for Humanity and a $530,373 loan repayment related
to a loan made for the Aster Park Apartments property. During
the first ten years of the planning period, staff projects the
program will receive another $1.7 million in loan repayments,
which includes payments on loans made for the Garland and
Tenaka Place sites.

By the end of FY 2014/15 the Housing Mitigation Reserve
is expected to have balance of approximately $18.9 million.
These funds are available for future affordable housing
projects in the City when they are identified. A placeholder
entitled Future Housing Projects is included in the long-term
financial plan for such projects.

Interest income on the reserve balances in this sub-fund
continues to accrue and is available for future housing
projects.

Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing
The BMR Program, as set forth in SMC Chapter 19.67, is
primarily intended to generate affordable housing directly,
through mandatory development requirements applied to most
new housing developments. This is a land use/zoning tool
used nationally to guarantee a minimum level of affordable
housing even in higher cost areas, known as “inclusionary
zoning.” The Municipal Code requires that developers sell
12.5% of all new homes in subdivision and condominium
developments to lower and moderate income households at
affordable prices established by the BMR program guidelines
and SMC Chapter 19.67. The BMR Program has specific
eligibility requirements and income limits for prospective
buyers of BMR homes.

In FY 2012/13, Council approved the sale of two City-owned
properties to Habitat for Humanity (Habitat). The Housing
Mitigation Fund funded this project in FY 2013/14 with a
bridge loan to Habitat for $870,000, which will be paid back
at $748,000 when the homes are resold to the home buyers,
using the sales proceeds. The difference of $122,000 is the
City assistance from Housing Mitigation Reserves needed to
make the project financially feasible. Project expenditures
total approximately $15.0 million for FY 2013/14, consisting
primarily of the Charities and Mid Pen Affordable Housing
projects at the Armory site, $5 million for the Homestead Park

182

▪▪ HOME Grant Fund

Revenues in the BMR Program include BMR In-Lieu fees,
BMR application fees, revenues from BMR compliance and
enforcement actions, payments on home buyer loans funded
from the BMR program, and interest earnings. Expenditures
include operating costs for administering and monitoring the
BMR program, and a special project for BMR compliance
enforcement.

HOME Investment Partnership Program grants from the
federal government may be used to provide affordable housing
to lower-income households. Eligible uses of HOME grant
funds include acquisition, new construction, rehabilitation,
tenant-based rental assistance, and down payment assistance.
The activities must benefit low-income households with
incomes at or below 80% of area median income. According
to federal statutes, HOME grants must be committed to a
specific project within two years and fully expended within
five years of the grant award.

The BMR Housing Program has a BMR Reserve for the
deposit of BMR In-Lieu Fees which are paid by developers
in accordance with project-specific developer agreements, in
lieu of providing actual BMR homes for sale, and/or to fulfill
fractional BMR unit requirements. The fee revenues are
intended to be used by the City to provide a comparable or
greater number of affordable housing units elsewhere in the
City. Since the Municipal Code was amended in 2012 to allow
greater application of the in-lieu fee option, no projects have
opted to pay in-lieu fees for the entire BMR obligation, so
the fee revenues to date are not substantial enough to finance
a stand-alone BMR housing project. However, based on
developer agreements approved to date, a stream of smaller
fractional in-lieu fee payments have begun to be received and
this revenue source is projected to grow in the coming years.
Once a significant amount of funds have accumulated in the
reserve, staff will issue an RFP to solicit affordable housing
proposals to utilize these funds for developing additional
affordable units, based on the priorities established by the
City in the Housing Element, Consolidated Plan, and/or
various adopted land use plans such as station area plans and/
or specific plans.

The recommended long-term financial plan for the HOME
Grant Fund includes an estimated grant allocation for FY
2014/15 of $309,091, and shows ongoing estimated HOME
grant revenues of the same amount as a placeholder for future
allocations. This is a decrease of 2% from the FY 2013/14
allocation, which is due to the current federal budget deficit
and sequestration actions.
The City also receives loan repayments on loans that had
been made with HOME grant funds for affordable housing.
Approximately $7.5 million in loan payments are expected
throughout the twenty-year plan, including $1.4 million for
repayment on a loan made for the Aster Park Apartments
property in FY 2013/14. These repayments will be utilized
for future HOME projects, to be identified and approved by
Council.

183

division staff estimates that the FY 2014/15 entitlement
amount will be $1,017,441. Since the City has received
CDBG funds annually over a number of years, we are
showing future grant receipts at the FY 2014/15 entitlement
level throughout the twenty year financial plan. The estimated
allocation is 4.3% less than the allocation from prior year.
As the federal government continues to address its sizeable
deficit, recent sequestration actions have impacted CDBG
funding. However, staff believes the program will continue
over the long term.

Funds in FY 2014/15 are primarily allocated to one special
project, Tenant Based Rental Assistance, for $278,182. Also
included in the long-term financial plan is a line item for
Future HOME/Housing Projects beginning in FY 2015/16. As
specific projects are identified, they will be brought to Council
for approval.

▪▪ Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
Fund
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program
is a federal program that allocates annual grants to larger
cities and urban counties to develop viable communities by
providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and
needed public services, principally for low- and moderateincome persons. The City receives an annual appropriation
from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) based on a formula derived by community need.

The CDBG and HOME grants must be spent in accordance with
a five-year “Consolidated Plan,” a strategic plan and budget
for use of these grants, submitted to HUD for approval every
five years. The plan identifies a jurisdiction’s overall needs
for affordable housing and other community development
activities. HUD requires the City to submit annual updates
during the intervening years of the Consolidated Plan,
generally done in May of each year.

Revenues for the Community Development Block Grant
Fund come from grants and the repayment of commercial and
residential loans. Primary expenditures are for operations,
housing opportunities, capital projects, and most of the City’s
outside group funding efforts.

CDBG funds may be used for acquisition, rehabilitation, and
preservation of existing affordable housing, certain types of
public services and facilities, and elimination of blight. Capital
and special projects funded with CDBG must implement the
goals of the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan. The City submits
a performance report to HUD annually to report on its uses
of the CDBG and HOME funds, and how these activities
contribute toward achieving the goals of the Consolidated
Plan.

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
The CDBG Program is funded by Community Development
Block Grants from the federal government. The Housing

loans to low-income residents and staff costs to administer the
program.

Additionally, by regulation, up to 15% of the annual CDBG
allocation plus prior year program income may be used for
public (human) services. The FY 2014/15 Recommended
Budget includes $198,000 for granting to qualified human
services providers or “sub-recipients”. Outside groups are
allocated funds on a two-year cycle and FY 2014/15 is the
second year of the current cycle.

▪▪ Park Dedication Fund
State law allows local communities to require developers of
housing units to offset the impact of those new housing units
on the City’s ratio of open space per 1,000 population by
providing additional open space or paying a comparable fee.
The Park Dedication Fund was established to meet statutory
requirements regarding the accounting for Park Dedication
Fees paid by developers. In general, the City collects park
in-lieu fees for housing projects that do not dedicate land
for use as parks or open space. This fee is calculated on an
average fair market value per square foot as determined by
the Community Development Department annually. In prior
years, the fee was based on a park facility standard of 1.25
acres per 1,000 population. In November 2009, Council
raised the standard to 3.0 acres per 1,000 population over a
three-year period. In April 2011, Council moved to raise the
standard to 5.0 acres per 1,000 population, also to be phased
in over three years. In FY 2013/14 the standard is 4.25 acres
per 1,000 population, and the fee is $69 per square foot. For
the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget, Park Dedication
Fees have been held flat at the current rate of $69, pending
completion of the land valuation study.

CDBG funds may also be used for projects that benefit groups
with special needs, such as senior or handicapped citizens,
or for targeted geographical areas that meet certain income
requirements. FY 2014/15 projects include $65,000 for Home
Access, Paint and Emergency Repair, and Energy-Efficiency,
$322,000 for the Sunnyvale Workforce Development
Program, and $338,000 for Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) Curb Retrofits.
CDBG Revolving Loan
The CDBG Revolving Loan Fund allows the City to account
for program income from housing loans made with CDBG
funds and reuse those funds for the same purpose (housing
rehabilitation), pursuant to HUD regulations. This Fund
has two sources of revenue: loan payments on prior CDBG
housing loans and transfers in from the CDBG Fund. The
current CDBG loan portfolio includes approximately 140
loans with a total outstanding debt of over $12.4 million. Staff
projects $250,000 in revenue for FY 2014/15 from the CDBG
loan payments. Expenditures for FY 2014/15 include one
project in the amount of $500,000 to provide rehabilitation

through FY 2016/17 are expected to be $9.5 million annually.
For FY 2017/18 through the end of the first ten years of the
plan, revenues are held flat at $7.6 million, based on the
historical average of an additional 200 fee eligible dwelling
units per year at the current fee of $69 per square foot, and
an estimated 5% increase in land value. These projections
yield approximately $81.5 million in revenue over the first ten
years, and an additional $84.4 million during the second ten
years of the long-term plan.

Authorizing language in the State Quimby Act indicates that
fees may be used to pay for “developing new or rehabilitating
existing neighborhood or community park or recreational
facilities.” Certain legal cases have clarified that park inlieu fees may be used for parks or recreational facilities that
are adjacent to the subdivision or multi-family development
from which they are collected but may also be used for larger
community parks and regional facilities that are reasonably
available for use by the residents of the subdivision or
development. Park Dedication Fees may not be used for
operating or routine maintenance. For the last several years,
Park Dedication Fees were also used to pay for golf course
rehabilitation projects. In April 2011, however, Council
acted to cease that practice for projects that were not already
programmed to be funded in this manner, determining instead
that golf course revenues associated with the Golf and Tennis
Enterprise Fund would pay for these improvements.

In April 2013, Council approved the sale of three Cityowned homes adjacent to Murphy Park on Jackson Street.
These homes had originally been purchased in anticipation
of expanding Murphy Park. However, the homes were not
adjacent to each other, and the City was unable to acquire the
remaining four homes along the block. These three homes,
along with three homes near Orchard Gardens Park that are
scheduled for demolition to facilitate that park’s expansion,
had previously provided rental income to the Park Dedication
Fund. The rental income from all six properties end in FY
2013/14, with the sale of two of the three Jackson Street
homes for $870,000; the sale of the third home is anticipated
in FY 2014/15 for $440,000.

Park in-lieu fees must be committed within a five-year period,
and certain of these fees are subject to the Fee Mitigation Act,
which requires specific review and findings every five years.
The City conforms with both of these requirements.

The Park Dedication Fund provides funding for capital and
infrastructure projects at community parks and recreational
facilities. A total of $103.9 million in transfers to the Capital
and Infrastructure Funds is programmed throughout the
long-term financial plan to ensure that park and recreational
facilities are in good working condition and able to meet the

will be received during FY 2013/14. Based on current
development projects in process, revenues for FY 2014/15

demands of increased public use. $5.1 million is programmed
for transfers to projects in FY 2014/15, the largest of which
is $4.3 million for the Lakewood Park Renovation and
Enhancement project, which will provide a major renovation
to the facility which was originally built in 1964. Other
notable projects include $306,000 for infrastructure repairs
and renovations to existing park buildings, and $408,000 for
the repair and renovation of existing golf buildings at both the
Sunnyvale and Sunken Gardens golf courses. Additionally,
as part of the $14 million in sale proceeds from the Raynor
Activity Center in FY 2014/15, approximately $2.4 million
will fund the Washington Pool Expansion project. This will
allow the project to be advanced by one year to FY 2015/16,
and free up $2.4 million from Park Dedication Fees for other
park capital project needs or land acquisition.

capital projects plan. This will be done for the FY 2015/16
Recommended Budget.

A budget supplement of $300,000 has also been programmed
in FY 2014/15 for the design and construction of a restroom
building to be installed at Las Palmas Park near the Sunnyvale
Tennis Center. Staff has recommended approval based on
current needs at both facilities. Operating costs are estimated
to be $11,000 annually and will be absorbed by the operating
budget in the Neighborhood Parks and Open Space program.

The Asset Forfeiture Fund was established to account for
monies received through drug and other law enforcement
activities as allowed under Federal and State asset forfeiture
guidelines. For the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget,
current projected revenues of $400,000 for FY 2013/14 and
FY 2014/15 have been adjusted down to $200,000 for each
of the two years. These revenues are for the Department of
Public Safety’s participation in a regional task force operated
by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and the original
estimates were preliminary figures. Because these funds are
received sporadically, future revenue is not budgeted. The
purposes for which asset forfeiture can be used are limited,
and funds are drawn down for new one-time expenses targeted

In addition to the Capital Projects Reserve, the twentyyear plan includes a second reserve fund that is specifically
designated for Land Acquisition funds. This reserve collects
twenty percent of the annual revenue from Park Dedication
Fees and allocates the funds to acquire and develop new
land for the purpose of parks, open space, trails and other
recreational facilities. Proceeds from the sale of the Jackson
Street properties are also placed in this reserve. In FY 2016/17
and FY 2017/18, funds in this reserve are earmarked for the
Plaza del Sol Phase II project.

▪▪ Asset Forfeiture Fund

The Capital Projects Reserve includes funds that have not
yet been appropriated to projects. While significantly more
Park Dedication Fee revenue is projected in this financial
plan as compared to last year, because this is not a projects
budget year, staff has not updated the twenty-year parks

FY 2022/23, and every five years thereafter throughout the
twenty-year plan, is funded from the General Fund.

The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget includes a continuing
transfer to the General Fund to support juvenile diversion
activities within the Police Services program. The City
currently has an agreement with the County of Santa Clara
to pay for the direct salary, excluding benefits, of one Deputy
Probation Officer. For FY 2014/15, this amount is $98,867.
This transfer is reflected through FY 2016/17, at which
point there are not enough funds to support this expenditure
along with other priorities. At that time, the Public Safety
Department will need to evaluate the juvenile diversion
activities in relationship to other departmental priorities to
determine whether to continue funding the program within the
City’s General Fund.

▪▪ Police Services Augmentation Fund
The Police Services Augmentation Fund accounts for two
grant programs that provide monies for law enforcement
purposes. The first is the Supplemental Law Enforcement
Services (SLES) program established by the State, and the
second is a smaller federal Edward Byrne Memorial Justice
Assistance Grant from the Bureau of Justice Administration
(BJA).
The State SLES monies constitute the major portion of this
fund. The City first received the SLES grant in FY 1996/97.
Over the years, the amounts of both grants have decreased or
varied significantly. BJA decreased from a high of $70,158 to
a low of $0 in FY 2011/12. SLES funding has also fluctuated
over the years, with a high of nearly $300,000 in FY 1996/97
and a low of $100,000 in FY 2008/09 and again in FY
2010/11. After initially being eliminated, funding for FY
2011/12 was restored to a level of nearly $230,000, which was
the result of the State shifting Motor Vehicle License funds
away from local agency general funds into the grants that
provide SLES funding. This was intended to be a permanent
shift, and as such, funding in the amount of $229,693 has been
programmed for the entire twenty-year plan starting with the

The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget also includes $45,390
for the Police Services Equipment - Cell Phones project,
which supports the cost of specialized cellular phones used
for police services. This project has been programmed to end
in FY 2021/22, at which point the ending twenty-year reserve
is unable to fund the project. It also reflects approximately
$373,000 budgeted in the Police Services Equipment
Acquisition project for replacement of tasers every five years,
starting in FY 2017/18. Due to limitations in Asset Forfeiture
funding, the next replacement of tasers in FY 2022/23 reflects

188

FY 2013/14 budget. The FY 2014/15 budget continues to
keep funding at this same level of $229,693 in the budget year
and through the end of the twenty-year plan. Because of the
stable funding, SLES monies will fund nearly one full-time
officer for the Department of Public Safety, with the remaining
cost being funded by the General Fund. This is in keeping
with past use of these funds, which has been for staffing for
most of the years. Because BJA funds are uncertain, they
are not projected in the long-term plan and instead will be
appropriated as they become available.

grants from federal and state sources. Since July 1, 2000, the
primary funding source for the NOVA Workforce Services
Department has been federal Workforce Investment Act
(WIA) appropriations and competitive grants.
The WIA dictates funding formulas whereby the allocation
of funds provided by Congress to support the Act is
distributed to the states. A primary factor of these formulas
is the unemployment rate. These funds come in three targeted
categories: Youth, Adult, and Dislocated Worker. Each of
these categories serves a defined population.

▪▪ Employment Development Fund

The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget is based on an
estimate of grant resources for the year. In addition, NOVA’s
staffing level is based on an approach that budgets staffing
only for its most stable funding resources, which are NOVA’s
allocated funding and its longest-funded competitive WIA
grant, funded from the State’s Additional Assistance pool.
NOVA has a long history of being very competitive for
additional federal and state resources and intends to submit
several grant applications during the year. Any additional
revenues and expenditures as a result of new grants obtained,
including the need to budget casual staff for those short-term
projects, will be reflected in a cumulative budget modification
submitted each fiscal year. For the purposes of the City’s FY
2014/15 Recommended Budget, NOVA has taken the total
funding estimates as described and used these as the basis for
NOVA’s FY 2014/15 program and service levels. This budget
incorporates guidance received from the state, which provided
specific planning goals.

The City of Sunnyvale, as administrative entity for the North
Valley (NOVA) Job Training Consortium, is required by
legislation and regulations to account for the use of various
federal and state funds and program revenues for the workforce
development activities that are conducted for the consortium.
The City established the Employment Development Fund to
fulfill this obligation.
NOVA, formed in 1983, serves the cities of Cupertino, Los
Altos, Milpitas, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Santa Clara
and Sunnyvale. The City of Sunnyvale, through its NOVA
Workforce Services Department, administers NOVA’s
programs on behalf of the consortium cities. NOVA has a wide
variety of programs funded through various sources, with
baseline funding originating from the federal government and
passing through the State of California. A significant amount
of additional grant money is received through competitive

189

It is important to note that, as different grants come and go,
various programs and activities operated by NOVA often
have a short lifespan relative to programs operated by other
City departments. Therefore, the current listings of programs
that have been operated by NOVA during the last several
years are not included in the budget document. Rather, a base
funding level will be carried into the new fiscal year and the
budget will be modified for planned activities, outcomes, and
expenditures during the course of the year as new funding is
secured and new contract goals and obligations are agreed
upon.

The approval of Proposition 218 had a significant effect
on the methodologies utilized to raise assessments to fund
maintenance and operations within the Parking District.
Proposition 218 not only deals with the approach and
methodologies to be used for benefit assessments, but also
the approval process. Essentially, after a method has been
selected, a vote occurs by those who would be assessed, with
votes weighted according to the amount of assessment. If this
weighted majority does not approve the assessment, then it
does not go forward.
For a number of years, the Parking District assessment was
set by an election held every one or two years. In June 2009,
the District property owners approved a long-term assessment
methodology whereby the FY 2009/10 assessment rate was
set as the base rate that would be adjusted annually by the
previous year’s change in the Consumer Price Index going
forward. For FY 2014/15, the special assessment is held
flat to the FY 2013/14 assessment of $180,307 for planning
purposes. Total project costs of $1.3 million are planned over
the twenty-year plan to install gutters and rehabilitate existing
pavement in the downtown lots, and for various maintenance
activities, including periodic asphalt patching, slurry seals,
curb painting, sign replacement, and re-striping as necessary.

In the past, the NOVA Workforce Services Fund’s long-term
financial plan reflected grant revenues only for the immediate
planning period. To recognize NOVA’s long tenure in the
City, grant funding of $8.7 million has been projected for
FY 2014/15, and an average resource level of $7 million per
year has been programmed for the remaining 19 years of the
twenty-year planning period.

▪▪ Parking District Fund
The Parking District Fund is a small fund that provides for the
ongoing landscape and maintenance of downtown parking lots
through assessments on property owners within the district.
The Downtown Parking District includes all public parking in
the downtown area, with the exception of the parking provided
by the Sunnyvale Town Center.

Annual operations costs represent the ongoing maintenance
of the Parking District by the City for personnel, utilities,
materials, contractual services and other items necessary or

190

appropriate for the parking facilities and administration of the
district and assessment.

Combined Gas Tax revenues have been projected at
approximately $3.6 million each year throughout the twentyyear plan. Because these revenues are based on the number
of gallons sold and not on the price of gasoline, no growth
in revenue is projected. This is assumed because staff
expects advancements in fuel economy to offset increases in
population that will increase the total number of vehicles on
the road.
	
In accordance with State law, the Gas Tax Fund receives
interest earnings on any unspent cash balances. Gas Tax
funds must be spent on maintenance and capital related to
public streets and highways. The Gas Tax Fund works in
tandem with the General Fund, with a set amount of funding
for operations and remaining funds used to cover Gas Taxeligible capital projects.

It is anticipated the Parking District and assessment
methodology will be reviewed after the redevelopment of the
adjacent Town Center and Town and Country sites.

▪▪ Gas Tax Fund
The Gas Tax Fund is required by State law to account for Gas
Taxes collected and allocated by the State. The State Gasoline
Tax is a flat rate per gallon levied on gasoline and other motor
fuels. Gas Tax is distributed to the State, cities, and counties
on a formula based on population and the proportion of
registered vehicles.
In March 2010 the legislature passed a bill that repealed the
State Sales Tax on gasoline, which had been the funding
source for Proposition 42, and replaced it with an increased
excise tax on gasoline. In effect, this increased the Gas Tax
rate to 35.3 cents per gallon. The intention was to replace the
revenues expected from Proposition 42. As such, it includes
an annual index which ensures that it will keep pace with the
repealed sales tax revenue. It should be noted that only the
State Sales Tax on gasoline was repealed; the local 1% rate
remains intact. Starting with the adopted FY 2011/12 budget,
revenues and expenditures that were formerly in the Traffic
Congestion Relief Fund (Proposition 42) were incorporated
into the Gas Tax Fund to reflect this legislation.
	

Operating expenses programmed for Public Works Department
street maintenance in this Fund are approximately $2 million
annually for FY 2014/15 and the remainder of the first ten
years of the long-term plan. Operating expenses covered by
the Gas Tax Fund are $1.4 million annually in the second ten
years of the long-term plan. The reduced level reflects the
slow decline in Gas Tax revenue that is anticipated over the
long term.
The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget for the Gas Tax Fund
has transfers to the Capital and Infrastructure Funds of $2.2
million. Of this amount, $1.3 million is for the Pavement

191

Rehabilitation project and $357,000 is for the Traffic Signal
Hardware and Wiring project. Approximately $300,000 is also
programmed to be transferred to the Capital Projects Fund for
the Calabazas Creek Bridge Replacement project to upgrade
the safety of the structure. The Gas Tax Fund also transfers
funds to replace the controls, LED arrays, and backup battery
systems of traffic signals, as well as the replacement of street
light conduit.

The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget does not include any
new appropriations; however, as TDA-eligible projects are
identified, revenues will be recognized and appropriated to
those projects. FY 2013/14 appropriations are primarily for the
Residential and School Area Sidewalks project ($133,000),
the Duane Avenue Bicycle Lanes project ($94,000), and the
Mary Avenue Bike Lanes project ($347,000).

▪▪ Vehicle Registration Fee Fund

The project administration expenditure in the Gas Tax Fund
represents the indirect charges for Engineering Services that
are expected to be utilized in supporting capital projects that
are funded from the Gas Tax Fund.

In 2010, voters approved Measure B, which collects vehicle
registration fees to pay for programs and projects that provide
local transportation improvements. In FY 2012/13 the City of
Sunnyvale established a special revenue fund to account for
revenues received through the $10 annual Vehicle Registration
Fee (VRF) assessed to automobiles owned by residents of
Santa Clara County.

▪▪ Transportation Development Act (TDA) Fund
In FY 2003/04 a small special revenue fund was established to
account for activities related to Transportation Development
Act (TDA) funds. These funds were created by State
legislation that annually returns to each region in the State ¼
of 1% of State Sales Tax revenues to be used for transportation
projects. These funds are restricted for pedestrian and bicycle
facilities and bicycle safety education programs and must be
segregated for those purposes. The TDA, in accordance with
Public Utilities Code Section 99245, must submit a report of a
fiscal and compliance audit made by an independent auditor at
the end of each fiscal year.

In 2012, the VRF provided $14.8 million to the County, and
80 percent of this amount was distributed to the cities based on
population. In August 2012, the City of Sunnyvale received its
first allocation of VRF funds in the amount of $797,394. For
FY 2014/15, the City has received $843,000 in VRF funds,
and it is expected that the City’s share will remain constant
throughout the twenty-year planning period. In general, VRF
funds are distributed based on each jurisdiction’s population
in the county, and a small percentage is available based on a

192

competitive County-wide program. The remainder is reserved
for Program Administration.

FY 2014/15 this reimbursement is projected to be $189,699
and considers the additional reimbursement related to the
recently completed Center expansion. Other revenues to the
Fund are recreation fees, rental fees for the facilities, interest
earnings on the endowment, and an annual subsidy from the
General Fund. For FY 2014/15, this subsidy is expected to be
$478,577.

All VRF funds received from the County are programmed to
be transferred to the Infrastructure Fund to provide funding
for the Pavement Rehabilitation project.

▪▪ Youth and Neighborhood Services Fund

Expenses included in this Fund are for the direct services
provided at the CNC, including CNC operations, which is
overseen by the Library and Community Services Department.

The Youth and Neighborhood Services Fund accounts for
the revenues and ongoing operating program expenditures
associated with the management and maintenance of the
Columbia Neighborhood Center (CNC). On May 10, 1994,
Council approved development of a neighborhood service
center at Columbia Middle School to meet the health, social,
recreational, and educational needs of North Sunnyvale
residents (with an emphasis on serving disadvantaged youth)
through a coordinated network of services. Advanced Micro
Devices contributed $1 million to the Columbia Neighborhood
Center project, one-half of which Council used to establish
the Youth Opportunity Fund (now renamed the Youth and
Neighborhood Services Fund) to generate interest to help
offset ongoing operating program expenditures.
The operating program expenditures for Columbia
Neighborhood Center and related projects are accounted for
in this fund, along with the associated program revenues. As
outlined in the partnership agreement, the City is reimbursed
by the Sunnyvale School District for a portion of the cost of
services provided at the Columbia Neighborhood Center. For

sub-fund. In FY 2014/15 it accounts for $8.4 million in
appropriations to projects. Of this amount, $6 million is
planned for the Fair Oaks Ave Overhead Bridge renovation,
with another $13 million planned for FY 2015/16 for that
project. The Lakewood Branch Library Facility is also
accounted for in this Fund. A total of $11.5 million is budgeted
over the next four years for design and construction of the
branch library. This project is contingent on the final sale
of the Raynor Activity Center, and the recommended project
budget has been adjusted to accommodate the sale timeline
accordingly. Proceeds from the sale of the Raynor Activity
Center are significant enough to also accelerate the funding
of the Washington Pool Expansion project. The project was
previously scheduled to begin in FY 2016/17, but has been
accelerated to begin in FY 2015/16.

Capital and Infrastructure Projects Funds are used for major
capital acquisition, construction activities, and renovation or
replacement of general City fixed assets. The City currently
accounts for these activities in two funds: the Capital Projects
Fund and the Infrastructure Renovation and Replacement
Fund. Capital and Infrastructure projects related to the Utility
Enterprise Funds are budgeted and accounted for within each
individual utility fund.

▪▪ Capital Projects Fund
The Capital Projects Fund was established in FY 1997/98
to account for financial resources to be used for new or
substantially enhanced assets or for major rehabilitation of
capital facilities. These projects are funded by the General
Fund, other governmental funds, or outside sources. Outside
revenues into the Capital Projects Fund include federal
and state grants, intergovernmental revenues, developer
contributions, Traffic Impact and Mitigation Fees, and Sense
of Place Fees.

There are also a significant number of projects funded in FY
2013/14, that will not fully expend their appropriations, in FY
2013/14, and these unspent funds will be carried over into FY
2014/15. Projects that are currently underway include the
Orchard Gardens Park Expansion project, which is funded
by a $869,000 transfer from the Park Dedication Fund, the
Safe routes to School and Neighborhood Guided Bike Routes
project which is funded by a federal grant, the installation
of pay parking systems in the downtown area (funded by
a $95,000 transfer from the General Fund), the Hendy
Avenue Complete Street Project, Downtown Streetscape

The Capital Projects Fund is divided into distinct sub-funds
that receive direct transfers from the funds that are responsible
for particular projects. Each sub-fund records revenues,
interest earnings, transfers and expenses separately.

Cumulative Traffic Mitigation Fees. The Traffic Mitigation
Sub-Fund was created in order to use Cumulative Traffic
Mitigation Fees for capital projects that improve traffic
capacity or alternative transportation facilities. Funds
are allocated to projects of local or regional significance,
depending upon the nature of traffic impacts identified in
association with the land development. The adoption of the
Transportation Strategic Program in November 2003 replaced
the interim Cumulative Traffic Mitigation Fees.

Improvements, and design work on the repair of the Fair Oaks
Overhead Bridge. Beyond FY 2014/15, significant projects in
this Sub-Fund include Downtown Wayfinding and Gateways,
Downtown Murphy Avenue Streetscape Revitalization, and
the Plaza Del Sol Phase II project.
Gas Tax Sub-Fund
The Gas Tax Sub-Fund accounts for capital projects funded
partially or fully by Gas Tax revenues. There are no new
appropriations in FY 2014/15. However, carryover from FY
2013/14 is expected for the design phase of the Calabazas
Creek Bridge project, with construction scheduled for FY
2014/15.

The Traffic Mitigation Sub-Fund contains one capital project,
Future Traffic Signal Construction/Modification, which is
expected to be complete in FY 2013/14. Outside of the Future
Traffic Signal Construction/Modification project, these funds
have also been utilized to provide the local match for grant
funding. Because these funds have been available, the City
has been able to leverage significant grant dollars to several
current traffic and transportation projects including the Old
San Francisco Road/Sunnyvale Avenue Left Turn project, the
Bicycle Lanes on Mathilda Avenue and Wildwood Avenue
projects, the Safety Improvements at the intersections of
Mathilda and Maude and Sunnyvale-Saratoga and Fremont
projects, the Remington Drive and Bernardo Ave Traffic
Signal, and Hendy Ave Street Improvements. It is estimated
that the Traffic Mitigation Fund will have a balance of
approximately $716,000 available for grant matching
purposes at the end of FY 2013/14.

Calabazas Creek Bridge Sub-Fund
A new Sub-Fund was established in the Capital Projects Fund
in FY 2013/14 to account for $565,000 received from the City
of Santa Clara to fund its share of the Calabazas Creek Bridge
renovation. The purpose of this Sub-Fund is to account for the
interest allocation from the City of Santa Clara contribution
that the City will be managing and administering.
Traffic Mitigation and Traffic Impact Fees Sub-Funds
The Cumulative Traffic Mitigation Fees and Traffic Impact
Fees are accounted for in individual sub-funds of the Capital
Projects Fund. Prior to the adoption of the Transportation
Strategic Program in November 2003, an interim funding
mechanism was implemented for transportation mitigation
of major land development. This mechanism was known as

The Traffic Impact Sub-Fund was created to account for the
Traffic Impact Fee that was adopted in November 2003 to be

220

applied to traffic-generating development Citywide. As noted
above, this Traffic Impact Fee replaced the interim Cumulative
Traffic Mitigation Fee. The City began collecting Traffic
Impact Fees on new developments in January 2004. Traffic
Impact Fees are to be applied to a specific list of roadway
capacity improvement projects that were identified using a
Citywide transportation model. The Transportation Strategic
Program consists of 11 projects totaling $290 million. These
projects are largely unfunded and will move into the City’s
twenty-year Projects Budget as funds are received and
improvements are needed. A comprehensive listing of these
projects can be found under Traffic and Transportation in
Volume II – Projects Budget of the FY 2014/15 Recommended
Budget.

that the City’s share of construction will be $8.25 million.
A project to improve the Washington Ave and Mathilda Ave
intersection is also included in FY 2014/15. Beginning in FY
2015/16, funds have been set aside in a Future Transportation
Strategic Plan Projects expenditure line item to reflect the fact
that the purpose of these funds is to accumulate and be used
for major roadway projects, as identified in the Transportation
Strategic Program.
Sense of Place Sub-Fund
This Sub-Fund was established in the Capital Projects Fund in
FY 2008/09 to formally account for projects funded by Sense
of Place Fees. Sense of Place Fees have been collected in
the City for several years as conditions of approval in certain
Industrial-to-Residential areas. So far, the City has three
land use areas subject to Sense of Place Fees. These are the
Tasman/Fair Oaks Area, the Duane/Lawrence Expressway
Industrial-to-Residential area, and the Fair Oaks Junction area.
Dwelling units constructed in these areas are each subject to a
Sense of Place Fee as a condition of approval.

As the local economy continues to recover, the City is seeing
larger development projects that are generating significant
Traffic Impact Fee revenue. $3.5 million is anticipated in
FY 2013/14 and $5.6 million in FY 2014/15. Beginning in
FY 2015/16, revenues are budgeted at the six year historical
average of $1.82 million annually, adjusted for inflation. For
the twenty-year planning period, a total of approximately $52
million in Traffic Impact Fee revenue is expected.

Sense of Place Fee revenues are projected to total $938,000
over the next three years through FY 2016/17, and then
decrease to $145,000 annually, adjusted for inflation,
throughout the long-term plan. Approximately $4 million is
expected over the entire twenty-year planning period.

There are no new projects in the Traffic Impact Sub-Fund
in FY 2014/15. Funds are currently appropriated to the
design and construction of Interchange Improvements at
Mathilda/237/101. The design phase is 50 percent funded
by a grant from the VTA. Construction costs in the amount
of $16.5 million are planned for FY 2015/16. It is estimated

Staff believes that Sense of Place Fees could become more
widespread in coming years. The fees would be required
in areas where desired public improvements exceed the

221

of the funds for the design costs of the Mathilda/237/101
Interchange Improvement project. The entire project design
budget, as well as the City’s 50% share of the cost, is included
in the Traffic Impact Fee Sub-Fund. The purpose of this SubFund is to account for the interest allocation from the VTA
grant funds that the City will be managing and administering.
	

requirements of other areas of the City. Developers are
normally responsible for frontage improvements, and Sense
of Place Fees would help pay for other amenities that are
not project-specific and benefit the entire area (e.g. special
signage, area entry treatments, aesthetic enhancements, etc.).
Sense of Place Fees could also be required in areas with
special land use or public improvement plans (Specific Plans,
Precise Plans, Pedestrian and Bicycle area plans, etc.). Specific
projects for future fee revenues have not yet been identified.
Anticipated future expenditures are shown as Future Sense of
Place Projects in the long-term plan.

▪▪ Infrastructure Renovation and Replacement
Fund
The Infrastructure Renovation and Replacement Fund was
introduced with the FY 1996/97 budget. Its purpose is to
account for revenues and expenditures associated with the
Long-Range Infrastructure Plan, which was established to
fully fund the rehabilitation of the City’s extensive physical
infrastructure, except for utility assets, which are funded
separately in the utility funds.

State Infrastructure Bond Sub-Fund
An additional revenue source reflected in a Sub-Fund of the
Capital Projects Fund beginning in FY 2008/09 is the State
Infrastructure Bond (Proposition 1B) for Local Streets and
Roads, which was passed by the voters in November 2006.
These funds have been used for the Wolfe Road Caltrain
Overcrossing project, a major sidewalk and curb reconstruction
project, and on various slurry seal/street resurfacing projects.
The City received two allocations of Proposition 1B funds
of $2.1 million for a total of $4.2 million. With the final
expenditures of these funds, the fund was closed at the end of
FY 2012/13.
	
VTA Local Program Reserve Sub-Fund

Similar to the Capital Projects Fund, this Fund is divided into
distinct sub-funds that receive direct transfers from the funds
that are responsible for the particular infrastructure projects.
Each sub-fund records revenues, interest earnings, transfers
and expenses separately. Currently, there are two sub-funds:
General and Golf and Tennis. The General Sub-Fund accounts
for the majority of City infrastructure projects. The Golf and
Tennis Sub-Fund is specifically for golf and tennis projects,
with funding predominantly from the Park Dedication Fund.

A new Sub-Fund was established in the Capital Projects Fund
in FY 2012/13 to account for a $2 million VTA Local Program
Reserve funds grant. This grant was awarded to provide 50%

There are 22 projects in the General Sub-Fund recommended
for funding in FY 2014/15 totaling $14.2 million.

222

Approximately $5.8 million will be funded by a transfer
from the General Fund, $4.4 million of which is associated
Pavement Rehabilitation, a long-term project that enhances
service levels for street maintenance. This project is discussed
in more detail below. The FY 2014/15 budget also contains an
additional $1 million over two years for concrete and sidewalk
replacement, bringing the total for the next two years to just
over $2 million. Strategies and funding to address the backlog
of side walk repairs will be considered as part of the FY
2015/16 capital projects budget cycle. Another $1.8 million
is funded with Gas Tax funds, including $1.3 million for
pavement rehabilitation and the remainder for traffic-related
projects. $5.1 million is funded by the Park Dedication Fund,
almost all of which is for the rehabilitation of parks and park
amenities.

related infrastructure. These assets are an important part of
the foundation of our service provision to the community. The
City has long recognized the importance of maintaining these
assets, as evidenced by the City policy of prioritizing the repair
and replacement of existing infrastructure before the provision
of new or expanded facilities. To this end, starting with the
adopted FY 2011/12 Budget, the City has been setting aside
funding for investment in its infrastructure. A total of $47.7
million is currently earmarked for an investment in pavement
rehabilitation, which provides the funding to return the City’s
Pavement Condition Index (PCI) to a level of 80, and then
provides sufficient funding to maintain that level going
forward. With the passage of Measure B in 2011, additional
funding has become available annually for streets and roads
improvements. This new funding stream allowed the City
to reallocate an equivalent portion of infrastructure funding
to other needs. Beginning in FY 2012/13, the reallocated
portion provided additional annual funding for increases to
tree trimming services and concrete rehabilitation. The FY
2014/15 budget maintains this commitment to infrastructure
rehabilitation.

In the Golf and Tennis Sub-Fund, there is $408,000 budgeted
in FY 2014/15 for minor renovation of golf buildings. This
fund provides for projects related to golf and tennis through
FY 2033/34. It is then expected that the Golf and Tennis
Enterprise Fund will fund its own infrastructure and capital
projects. However, given the many challenges that the
enterprise is facing, a discussion of the long-term funding
model will begin in the next year.

While these actions have made significant progress to funding
the City’s core infrastructure needs, there are still areas that
need to be addressed, predominantly the rehabilitation and/
or reconstruction of our administrative facilities such as City
Hall, the City Hall Annex, the Department of Public Safety, the
Library, and the Corporation Yard. While the exact needs, and
the best way to fund these needs, are still being evaluated, the
FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget continues to provide $1.5

As has been noted in the last two budget documents, the City’s
lack of ongoing funding to address the City’s infrastructure
needs remains a particular area of concern. The City has a
vast and wide array of infrastructure assets to maintain,
including buildings, streets, parks, sidewalks, and utility-

223

million per year from the General Fund, totaling $30 million
over twenty years, and increases a previous contribution from
the General Services Fund by $800,000 to begin to address
the rehabilitation of the City’s administrative facilities.

ENTERPRISE FUNDS

▪▪ Water Supply and Distribution Fund

Utility Enterprise Funds and Utility Rate Process

The Water Supply and Distribution Fund (Water Fund)
accounts for all revenues and expenses related to the Cityoperated water utility. Expenses include costs for wholesale
water, capital and infrastructure project-related costs, debt
service, and other operating costs. Revenues consist of service
fees for water and recycled water, water-related public works
and construction fees, and interest income. Once expenditure
levels are developed, water rates are set to collect enough
revenue to maintain a sustainable financial position. The
annual review and use of long-range financial planning and
projections help minimize utility rate swings.

The following across-the-board changes to current rates for
the Water, Wastewater, and Solid Waste Utility enterprises are
recommended for Council approval for FY 2014/15:
Utility

Rate Change

Water

5.0%

Wastewater

9.0%

Solid Waste

6.0%

The largest expense of the Water Fund is the cost of purchasing
water. Sunnyvale currently receives water from four different
sources, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
(SFPUC), the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD),
City-owned wells, and recycled water. The majority of supply
is provided by the SFPUC and SCVWD, set by contracts.
Only about half a percent will come from well water, which
is adequate to keep the wells fresh and operating. Any
remaining amount above the contractual minimums will
come from recycled water. The total cost of water makes up
58% of the FY 2014/15 budget and is projected to stabilize at
approximately 68% of budget within the first ten years of the
Long-Term Financial Plan.

Each increase and the contributing factors are discussed
below. The major reasons for the required increases in rates
are the continued and substantial rise in costs of purchased
water, major wastewater infrastructure needs, particularly at
the City’s Water Pollution Control Plant, and increases in the
City’s cost for providing solid waste collection and disposal.
As a result of these increases, monthly costs associated with
water, solid waste, and wastewater services for an average
residential customer will increase by $7.78 per month. It is
important to note that even with these increases, Sunnyvale
utility rates and services are competitive with our surrounding
communities.

249

Both the SFPUC and the SCVWD provided wholesale rate
projections for the next ten years. These projections are in
the base rate for the long term rate projections in the twentyyear financial plan and are reflected in the table below. The
projected increases in the table do not reflect changes in the
BAWSCA Surcharge or any other costs related to purchasing
water. Additionally, the SFPUC is projecting a rate decrease
in FY 2020/21. It is the City’s practice not to recognize
decreases, as they are unlikely to actually occur, and instead
hold the rate flat for that year. The estimated decrease is
significant enough that the rate is projected flat for two years.

Overall the City’s water demand grew 11% in FY 2012/13
after several years of decline. Due to improvements in the
plumbing code and water use efficiency, only moderate
growth is expected each year over the next twenty years.
Additionally, as the region is currently experiencing a drought,
a reduction in demand is projected for FY 2013/14 and FY
2014/15. FY 2013/14 is a reduction of 4% from FY 2012/13,
and FY 2014/15 projections are a reduction of 10% from the
prior fiscal year. This anticipated reduction affects both the
revenue and expenses of the Fund. To the extent that the City’s
suppliers reduce their contractual minimums to accommodate
decreased demand, the City is projecting savings from water
purchases. However, buying less also translates to selling
less, and therefore the financial plan anticipates a 10% revenue
reduction as well. These are reflected as separate line items
titled “drought reduction.”

Projected Increases in Base Wholesale Rates
Fiscal Year
SFPUC
SCVWD

The City is currently paying the SFPUC approximately
$1,096 per acre foot of water, including meter charges, and
paying SCVWD $780 per acre foot, including a treated water
charge. The City is also paying approximately $1.5 million in
FY 2013/14 to the SFPUC for the Bay Area Water Supply and
Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) Surcharge which makes
up Sunnyvale’s share of the debt service on bonds issued by
BAWSCA in FY 2012/13. BAWSCA issued the bonds on
behalf of its 26 member agencies in its effort to restructure
capital debt owed to the SFPUC for facilities constructed by
the SFPUC that benefit the regional customers.

projects or reserved to offset future rate increases as
appropriate.

capital improvement projects that may bring recycled water to
more areas of the City.
Operations and Capital Expenses
The FY 2014/15 budget for the Water Fund includes
approximately $5.8 million for personnel and other costs
related to operating and maintaining the water supply and
distribution system. The Water Fund contains annual debt
service of approximately $2.0 million in FY 2014/15. This
consists of two components, the majority of which is $1.9
million for debt service on the City’s 2010 Water Revenue
Bonds. The remainder of the debt service is the Water Fund’s
portion of the Certificates of Participation issued in 2001 for
purchase of the 505 West Olive Avenue Government Center
property. This latter debt service ends in FY 2029/30. The
Fund also has a small interfund loan repayment that terminates
in FY 2014/15 for the purchase of the property adjacent to the
Corporation Yard.

The projected well water total unit cost for FY 2014/15 is
$858 per acre foot, an increase of 8.7% over the current year
unit cost of $789. This cost includes a charge from SCVWD
for pumping ground water from City wells (pump tax), as well
as the power costs associated with running the pumps.
The City attempts to purchase water at the lowest possible
cost. The City’s water system allows the movement of water
from one portion of the City to another, and this allows staff
to monitor and adjust water purchases to utilize the most cost
effective source, while still meeting our minimum contractual
requirements for purchases. Despite these efforts and the
drought-related supply reductions, the rate increases by the
City’s water suppliers result in the City’s total purchased
water costs for FY 2014/15 increasing by 5.5% in comparison
to FY 2013/14.

Like all municipalities in the state and the country, Sunnyvale’s
water storage and distribution systems are over fifty years old
and in need of significant rehabilitation. The Environmental
Services Department prioritizes projects to address this aging
water utility infrastructure, as well as spend bond proceeds in
a timely manner. Over the past few fiscal years, the highest
priority was placed on water pipe replacements. By mid
FY 2014/15, the City will complete almost $10 million in
accelerated replacements. The City will begin in FY 2014/15
to replace all the mechanical and electrical components of

Lastly, the City’s Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP)
provides recycled water, which is wastewater that has been
treated to very high standards. Recycled water is currently
sold at 90% of water rates to encourage its use. In prior years,
the City received a $115 per acre foot rebate from SCVWD
to encourage its use, but this ended in August 2009. Staff and
SCVWD have ongoing discussions to partner in significant

251

▪▪ Wastewater Management Fund

the Wolfe-Evelyn Water Plant. The mechanical and electrical
systems associated with this Plant were built in 1959 and are
beyond their 40 year life expectancy. Staff will also continue
addressing the most pressing needs of the City’s water storage
tanks and water wells, as well as evaluating how to operate
these facilities within the context of the overall distribution
system.

The Wastewater Management Fund (Wastewater Fund)
accounts for revenues and expenses related to the provision
of the safe and reliable removal of wastewater from all
residences and businesses in Sunnyvale. Wastewater rates also
pay for half of the City’s street sweeping services, plus storm
water management, non-point source pollution prevention and
other critical public services.

Additionally, a renewed emphasis has been placed on the
City’s recycled water production and distribution system.
Funding for this effort crosses both the water utility and
the wastewater utility. $2.1 million has been budgeted
for Sunnyvale’s share of a regional project that includes
upgrades to the San Lucar Pump Station and extension of the
recycled water system along Wolfe Road to Homestead Road.
Sunnyvale is working with SCVWD to partner in funding this
significant expansion of the recycled water system. If such
an agreement is approved by Council, staff will return with
suggested revisions to the projects budget that reflects the
changes. No significant impacts on water rates are anticipated
as a result of any revisions to the projects.

The City owns and operates an extensive system for
management of wastewater within City limits and in a small
area in the northern portions of Cupertino and San Jose. The
system includes approximately 283 miles of sewer pipes,
a storm drainage system consisting of 330 miles of storm
drainage pipes, and a 29.5 million gallon per day (MGD design
capacity) Grade V Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP).
Operations include the transport of sewage to the treatment
plant, wastewater treatment, recycled water production,
industrial discharge inspection and enforcement, storm water
management, and many other services related to wastewater.
Operations and Capital Expenses

By City policy, the Water Fund maintains a Contingency
Reserve of 25% of operations and a Rate Stabilization Reserve
to normalize rates and provide for the effect of economic
cycles. This Fund also contains reserves for revenue and debt
funded projects to manage the naturally uneven flow of these
funds against project expenditures.

The proposed FY 2014/15 operations expenses in the
Wastewater Fund reflect personnel, chemicals, and other
costs. Additionally, the City’s street sweeping program is
funded equally by the Wastewater and Solid Waste Funds to
reflect the benefits that street sweeping provides in clearing

252

litter and debris off the streets and preventing that debris from
entering the storm drainage system.

Additional WPCP renovation projects include $29 million
for Program Management Services and $7 million for the
WPCP Master Plan. These projects will fund the identification
of future secondary and tertiary treatment processes, the
development of conceptual designs for future projects
within the reconstruction program, the preparation of the
programmatic environmental impact report, and oversight
of the implementation of the reconstruction program over
the next 12 years. The remaining $238 million will be
appropriated to specific, related projects as they are identified.

The Wastewater Utility is facing even larger infrastructure
challenges than the Water Utility and the FY 2014/15
Recommended Budget includes planned infrastructure
expenditures of approximately $384 million over twenty
years. The most significant undertaking is the renovation
of the City’s WPCP, which constitutes 86% of the planned
infrastructure costs ($331 million). WPCP replacement costs
are $15 million greater than FY 2013/14 projections due in
part to the addition of two full-time employees dedicated to
this effort.

Critical projects previously identified as necessary in the
short-term to address the most advanced areas of WPCP
deterioration, or where there is an increasing danger for failure
remain in progress. These infrastructure needs fall primarily
in two categories: 1) technology has not changed significantly
since they were originally built and will therefore become
part of the new plant, and 2) may be replaced again with
different technology or processes as part of the larger WPCP
replacement project, but will not last in the interim period.
Examples include a project to replace the gaseous chlorine
disinfection system with a much safer liquid hypochlorite
system and the rehabilitation of the WPCP’s digester facilities.

The most significant of the WPCP renovation projects to date
is approximately $51 million to design and construct new
primary treatment facilities. This includes a new head works
facility, which removes large debris from incoming sewage
and pumps the sewage into new primary treatment tanks
which, in turn, slow down the wastewater to settle out large
solids. The current influent sewage pump station has reached
the end of its useful life and the gas-powered influent engines
will be non-compliant with air regulations effective January
2016. The City anticipates building the new head works and
primary facilities at the current bio-solids drying operation
location, adjacent to the current influent pump station. As a
result, this project displaces the current bio-solids drying
operations and will likely require alternate operation (such
as vendor contracted drying operations) until new bio-solids
facilities are constructed.

In addition to the work on the WPCP, replacement of sewer and
storm pipe and facilities are a high priority. The wastewater
collection system consists of approximately 613 miles of
sewer and storm mains, and seven pump or lift stations. The
system has five major sewer trunk lines that terminate at the
WPCP, where sewage is treated.

253

The City’s wastewater collection systems are in need of
significant rehabilitation due to their age. The FY 2014/15
Recommended Budget includes approximately $29 million in
the first 10 years in projects related to sewer and storm water
collection and an additional $14 million of fully identified
projects in the second 10 years of the plan. Major projects
over the first 10 years include $11 million for sewer and
storm pipe improvements, $7 million for rehabilitation of the
Lawrence Expressway trunk line, $6 million for sewer and
storm pump and lift station rebuilds, and $5 million for storm
system trash capture devices installed throughout the storm
water collection system to meet new permit requirements.
This project, new in FY 2013/14, funds the installation of two
devices every other year for 10 years.

deferred until FY 2004/05. No changes have been made to the
loan payoff schedule as part of the FY 2014/15 Recommended
Budget.
Approximately $3 million annual debt service payments are
largely for the Wastewater Revenue Bonds, issued in 2010 for
$35 million, to refund the existing bonds and provide $22.5
million in new funds for capital and infrastructure projects.
Some bond proceeds are funding the initial efforts for the
renovation of the WPCP. Future debt is reflected in the New
WPCP Debt Service line item; the actual amount and structure
of the financing will be determined as the plan is further
defined. However, it is important to note that over time, the
City will be issuing bonds to fund the WPCP renovation. At
its completion, the City will be paying significant annual debt
service, anticipated to be approximately $23 million each
year, almost 30% of the Fund’s total expenses. This level of
debt service will require multiple years of high single digit
rate increases to fund. Debt service is also included for the
Wastewater Fund’s portion of the Certificates of Participation
issued in 2001 for purchase of the 505 West Olive Avenue
Government Center property.

The Wastewater Fund has two inter-fund loans advanced
from the General Fund. The first loan was to finance the
remodel of the primary facilities of the WPCP, expanding the
capacity from 22.5 million gallons per day to 29.5 million
gallons per day. The loan was made by the General Fund in
FY 1980/81 for a total of $10.7 million at 7% interest. The
original term was for 20 years; however payments were
periodically deferred or delayed to help balance cash needs
in the Wastewater Fund. Regular payments have been made
as scheduled since FY 2004/05. The second loan was made to
assist the Wastewater Fund with cash flow issues by providing
needed cash to stabilize rates. The loan was advanced in FY
1995/96 for a total of $2.4 million at 7% interest. The term
was for 20 years with ongoing payments also periodically

In order to help the Solid Waste Management Fund with cash
flow issues, the Wastewater Fund loaned the Solid Waste Fund
$2 million in FY 2011/12 at 4.5% interest. Payment is deferred
to FY 2015/16 and then repaid over a seven-year period. This
helps the Solid Waste Fund with cash it needed and helps the
Wastewater Fund in the future as its cash needs increase to
fund the new WPCP.

254

By City policy, the Wastewater Fund maintains a Contingency
Reserve of 25% of operations and a Rate Stabilization Reserve
to normalize rates and provide for the effect of economic
cycles. This Fund also contains reserves for revenue and debt
funded projects to manage the naturally uneven flow of these
funds against project expenditures.

the current FY 2013/14 contractor payment. However, over the
last four years the contractor payment has risen 15%, placing
a significant strain on the Fund. The bulk of that increase was
due to an accounting error made by Specialty regarding an
incentive payment for extending the useful lives of equipment
and inventory. This error resulted in an additional $1 million
dollars in FY 2012/13 than originally planned, and increased
the base payment. This required a drawing down the Fund’s
reserves over the near term, driving proposed solid waste rates
in the short term higher than planned.

▪▪ Solid Waste Management Fund
The Solid Waste Management Fund (Solid Waste Fund)
accounts for the revenues and expenses related to collection,
recycling, and disposal of solid waste generated within the
City of Sunnyvale. A private company, Bay Counties Waste
Services, doing business in Sunnyvale as Specialty Solid
Waste & Recycling (Specialty), has an exclusive franchise
for collection of solid waste and recyclable materials through
2021, and these contract costs are reflected here. Operation
of the Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT®)
Station and disposal of refuse at the Kirby Canyon Landfill
are captured in their own fund, but the City’s share of these
activities is reflected in the Solid Waste Fund.

The Solid Waste Fund has two inter-fund loans from the
General Fund. The first loan provided a total of $3.68 million
during 1985, 1988 and 1989 for construction of a system to
convert methane gas to a marketable form of energy. The
second loan, for $10.5 million, was to stabilize solid waste
rates between FY 1994/95 and FY 1998/99. Both loans bear
interest of 7%. No changes have been made to the loan payoff
schedule as part of the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget.
Additionally, in order to help with cash flow purposes, the
Solid Waste Fund reflects a $2 million loan made in FY
2011/12 from the Wastewater Fund at 4.5% interest. Payment
is deferred to FY 2015/16 and then repaid over a seven year
period. This helps the Solid Waste Fund with short term cash
flow, and the Wastewater Fund with cash it needs in the future
to fund the new WPCP.

The City’s franchise with Specialty is the largest single
expense within the Solid Waste Fund and makes up 45% of the
total expenses in the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget for
the solid waste system. The City’s payment for the following
fiscal year is driven primarily by actual expenditures from the
last full fiscal year, adjusted by various indexes as identified in
the contract. The projected FY 2014/15 contractor payment is
$20 million, an increase of about $530,000 or only 2.7% over

on the total tons of solid waste each community brings to the
SMaRT Station for materials recovery, transfer, and disposal.
At current garbage delivery rates, Sunnyvale is responsible
for about half of the SMaRT Station operating expenditures
and receives about half of the revenues earned by the cities
from recyclables removed from the garbage. The capital cost
of the SMaRT Station was financed by the sale of revenue
bonds by Sunnyvale. The debt service on the bonds is shared
among the three cities as specified in the MOU. The SMaRT
Station MOU expires in FY 2021/22.

and replacement equipment, as well as the estimated portion
of debt which will be issued in FY 2021/22 for a new materials
recovery system. Debt service also includes the Solid Waste
Fund’s portion of the Certificates of Participation issued in
2001 for purchase of the 505 West Olive Avenue Government
Center property.
The Fund also reflects a new project for implementing the
City’s Zero Waste policy. The project, which totals $500,000
over two years, is only sufficient to begin implementation. It
is anticipated that to fully implement Zero Waste, rates will
need to increase significantly above current projections.

▪▪ Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer
(SMaRT) Station Fund

The SMaRT Station Operations Fund was established to
account for operations at the facility. It receives revenue
from charges to the cities of Sunnyvale (Solid Waste
Fund), Mountain View, and Palo Alto, and from the sale of
recyclables. Major operating cost components include the
SMaRT Station operator contract and disposal fees and taxes
collected by the Kirby Canyon Landfill. The Fund is managed
so that annual revenues and expenditures are in balance and
that no fund balance, with the exception of a small debt
service reserve, is carried forward to the next year.

The Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT)
Station began operations in October 1993. The costs of
building, maintaining, and operating the SMaRT Station are
shared by the cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Palo
Alto as specified by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
among the cities. Operating costs and revenues from the sale

The SMaRT Station is operated by a private company under
contract with the City. The City Council awarded the current
agreement on February 13, 2007 to Bay Counties Waste
Services, who began operations on January 1, 2008. To date,
the City has issued seven-year operator agreements, and is
currently completing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a new

By fiscal policy, the Solid Waste Fund maintains a Contingency
Reserve of 10% of operations. This is less than the 25%
required for the Water and Wastewater Funds to reflect the
fact that this operation has less City-owned infrastructure at
risk for damage or disaster. The Fund also maintains a Rate
Stabilization Reserve similar to the other utilities.

a point when the facility and equipment will need replacement
or rehabilitation. In order to allow for the cost impact of this
eventuality, funding is projected for a new materials recovery
system and, any other improvements needed to the SMaRT
Station Facility in FY 2021/22, with annual debt service of
$2 million. Funding is also provided for planning and interjurisdictional coordination in FY 2016/2017 through FY
2019/20. Funds for design and construction are scheduled
for FY 2020/21 through FY 2022/23, either to replace the
SMaRT Station or to implement some other solution for the
management of solid waste and recyclables in the City. The
recommended budget is based on the initial construction
cost of the SMaRT Station. It is anticipated that the cost for
the ultimate replacement will be refined during the planning
phase of the project.

contract. The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget includes
additional funding in anticipation that the cost for this contract
will increase.
The three cities that participate in the SMaRT Station have
individual agreements with Kirby Canyon for landfill services
that require payment for disposal of a minimum quantity of
solid waste each year. This provision is commonly referred to
as a “put or pay” requirement. In October 2012, the cities had
the ability under the contract to modify the level of put or pay
required, and Sunnyvale’s exercised its right, lowering its solid
waste minimum quantity by the maximum allowable 10%.
In December 2013, the City executed a Second Amendment
to the Specialty franchise (RTC 13-300). In exchange for
lengthening the franchise by ten years, the three cities will
save between $4 and $7 million through reduced landfill costs
between 2014 and 2021.

▪▪ Development Enterprise Fund

The SMaRT Station Replacement Fund provides for the
replacement of City-owned SMaRT Station equipment.
The three participating cities contribute to these efforts
and to payment of debt service based on fixed percentages
established by the SMaRT Station MOU. Debt service reflects
payment through FY 2017/18 for debt issued for the original
cost of the facility, and through FY 2021/22 for replacement
of materials recovery facility equipment.

This new fund is being established for the FY 2014/15
Recommended Budget. In the past, development-related
activities and associated revenues have been included in the
General Fund across a range of operating activities, focused
primarily within the Building and Planning divisions of
the Community Development Department. As the level
of development activity in the City increases and decreases
in cycles, the City has created this new fund to better align
development-related revenues and expenses.

Staff projects that while most of the facility’s equipment
and the overall SMaRT Station can be maintained in good
working order through the term of the MOU, there will come

In the FY 2013/14 Adopted Budget it was anticipated that the
Development Enterprise Fund would be established for the

257

On the expenditures side, a specific set of operating activities
that City staff perform in order to enable and support
development in the City have been identified. As mentioned
above, Building Safety and Planning activities in the
Community Development Department make up approximately
64% of the total operating costs in this fund. Operations are
also budgeted for the following activities: particular Fire
Prevention and Hazardous Material Service program activities
in the Department of Public Safety; development-related
Transportation and Traffic Services and Land DevelopmentEngineering Services in the Department of Public Works; as
well as very specific operating activities in the Environmental
Services Department, Department of Library and Community
Services, Office of the City Attorney and Office of the City
Manager that relate to supporting development in the City.
To ensure a careful, methodological approach, identifying the
direct costs was the focus for the first year. Over the next year,
staff will identify the indirect costs that should be charged to
this fund.

FY 2014/15 budget. A reserve was established in the General
Fund to account for unplanned development-related revenue
in FY 2012/13. These funds would then be transferred to
the new fund. It is projected that the development revenues
will exceed budget again in FY 2013/14, such that the
Development Enterprise Reserve will reach just over $6.0
million. At the beginning of FY 2014/15, staff projects that
the Development Enterprise Fund will have a Transfer In from
the General Fund of $6,019,687.
Development-related revenue includes the major fees for
permits and licenses that the City collects, as well as from Plan
Check Fees and Engineering Fees. Over the past five years the
General Fund has seen significant fluctuations in the amount
of development-related revenue that has been received. When
the recession hit in FY 2008/09, activity slowed considerably
with revenues dropping all the way to $5.2 million in FY
2009/10. The rebound, however, began in FY 2009/10 and
continued to accelerate through FY 2011/12, with revenues
approaching $14 million. FY 2012/13 total developmentrelated revenues came in at about $12.8 million, and revenues
for FY 2013/14 are expected to remain strong. Beginning in
FY 2014/15, most of these revenues will be accounted for in
the new Development Enterprise Fund. The one exception
is Construction Tax; as a tax, it will remain in the General
Fund. Staff is projecting that the anticipated level of activity
will remain high, with FY 2014/15 revenues of $8.62 million
before returning to the historical average of $7.35 million. It
should be noted that this historical average has increased, with
three consecutive years of record high development activity.

The Program In-Lieu Charges fund direct labor overhead costs
of the Community Development Department management
program. The full indirect cost to the fund is not yet included
in the Fund. Transfer to the General Fund is to provide the
portion of funding for the Transportation and Traffic Services
Augmentation project that is attributable to developmentrelated activity. The Transfer to the General Services Fund of
$21,000 is for the Fleet program to purchase a new car to be
used for compliance inspections.

258

The direct operating costs in this Fund exceed the historical
average level of development revenues collected, creating a
structural challenge for the Fund. The operating expenses are
predominantly fixed. However, some of the costs are variable
and will fluctuate with the level of development activity.
Fund balance will be drawn down, as intended, in years where
the development revenue declines to the historical average
or lower. However, the fee levels need to be reviewed and
adjusted on an ongoing basis to ensure full cost recovery over
the long term. This new fund enables visibility toward the
actual revenue and expenses over time. Staff will work to
closely monitor the status of the new fund on both the revenue
and expense side, as the new fund comes into effect this year.

2013/14 revenues are anticipated to come in less than projected
by 4.3%. As a result, most of the reserves will be drawn down
by the end of FY 2013/14. FY 2014/15 revenues are projected
to increase by 5.4%, which factors in increased rent, increases
in green fees and growth in rounds played in the near term due
to temporary closings of nearby courses and an influx of new
employees to nearby companies. In addition, a new stream of
revenue is expected starting in FY 2014/15 with the lease of a
cell tower in Sunken Gardens. Over the long term, revenues
are projected to grow at a rate of 2% over the first ten years,
then under 2% over the long term. Staff is projecting very
modest growth in revenue as the popularity of golf declines.
Unless there is a change in the sport’s popularity, the number
of golf players is finite and the core group of golfers continues
to age.

▪▪ Golf and Tennis Operations Fund

Over the past year, staff has made good progress in reducing
the operating budget by restructuring the program and
eliminating positions as vacancies occur. However, the slow
growth in revenue is not keeping pace with expenditures,
resulting in an ongoing structural deficit of $100,000
throughout the twenty-year planning period. Staff continues
to look for additional opportunities to reduce costs. To better
evaluate the viability of the enterprise fund, in-lieu charges
have been broken out into program and citywide charges to
give more insight into what administrative overhead expenses
would be directly affected by changes in the golf business and
those expenditures of a Citywide nature that would remain in
any scenario.

Beginning in FY 2012/13, golf and tennis operations have
been operating as a stand-alone enterprise fund, with all
activities intended to be self-supporting. With almost two
years completed, the Fund continues to struggle, even after
a transfer of $300,000 from the General Fund in FY 2012/13.
The transfer was necessary after the golf course restaurant
operator abruptly terminated its operations at both golf
courses. Not only did this reduce rental income, but rounds
played decreased, reducing golf fee revenue as well.
The Fund began FY 2013/14 with a reserve balance of
$246,475. Revenue for the year has rebounded more slowly
than anticipated after a new restaurant operator came in; FY

259

The modest increases in revenue relative to rising operations
costs will cause the Golf and Tennis Fund to run a deficit
in FY 2017/18 if no action is taken. Furthermore, in the
longer term, existing capital improvement projects at the golf
courses will only be funded by Park Dedication Fees until
FY 2032/33. After this, golf and tennis revenues are expected
to fund any new capital or infrastructure projects. Given
the many challenges, staff continues to review golf course
operations and staffing levels, and will explore all options for
increasing revenues, implementing operational efficiencies,
and developing a funding plan for capital and infrastructure
improvements. A discussion of the long term viability of the
golf course operations and the current funding model needs to
also begin this year.

Agency Fund, and the Community Facilities District No.
3 Fund. While these funds are not internal service funds,
they are grouped with the internal service funds just for
presentation purposes in the budget document. These are
funds that separately account for assets that the City holds
in a trustee or agency capacity and uses to benefit a specified
purpose.

INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS
The City utilizes internal service funds to account for the
financing of goods and services provided by one department
or agency to other departments or agencies of the City. There
are three such funds that operate on a cost reimbursement
basis: the General Services Fund, the Employee Benefits and
Insurance Fund, and the Liability and Property Insurance Fund.
These funds play an important role in the overall ability of the
City to conduct business. The General Services Fund includes
the City’s Fleet Services, Facilities Management Services,
Technology and Communication Services, Sunnyvale Office
Center, and Project Management Services. The Employee
Benefits Fund serves to capture the costs associated with
employer provided benefits including pension costs, employee
insurance plans, workers’ compensation, and paid leave time.
The Property and Liability Insurance Fund accounts for the
costs related to the City’s liability and property insurance.

▪▪ General Services Fund
Fleet, Facilities, and Technology Services
The General Services Fund has three sub-funds that provide a
wide range of important support services to programs within
the City. These include Fleet, Facilities, and Technology
Services. Funding for these services is recovered through
rental rates charged to benefiting program operating budgets.
The rental rates include not only the cost of operations, but
also the cost of replacement for depreciable equipment. This
assures the availability of funds to replace equipment at the
most cost-effective time.

Sunnyvale’s full cost accounting methodology results in all
the costs of these funds being charged back to user activities
on a rental rate basis for general services, an additive rate
basis for employee benefits, and a usage basis for liability and
property insurance. Therefore, the total expenditures of these
funds are not added to the overall budget, as they are already
captured within the City’s programs and funds.

Aggregate rental rate increases for the combined General
Services Fund activities in FY 2014/15 are 3.4%, which is flat
to what had been projected for FY 2014/15 during last year’s
budget cycle. For the remainder of the front ten years of the
plan, the average annual rental rate increase is 2.6%, which is
up from the 2.4% average increase in the prior budget. This
is primarily due to the addition of personnel and increases in
maintenance and support costs in Information Technology

The four other funds presented in this section include the
Dorolou P. Swirsky Youth Opportunity Fund, the Fremont
Pool Endowment (Trust) Fund, the Redevelopment Successor

283

The projection for FY 2014/15 is based on historical averages
for the surplusing of vehicles and equipment. Increases are
projected for FY 2015/16 and FY 2016/17 when two fire
trucks are scheduled for replacement and staff anticipates
some resale value from the old fire trucks.

Services, and increases to the front ten years of the fleet
equipment replacement schedule. In the final ten years of the
long-term plan, rates are scheduled to increase 2.6% annually,
which is slightly above the 2.4% annual increase estimated
last year. This is mainly the result of increases to the Fleet
replacement schedule and Information Technology equipment
schedule. A more detailed narrative on changes in rental rates
is provided in the sections below that cover the individual
sub-funds.

The Intrafund Loan Repayment line item represents scheduled
payments from the Facilities Services Sub-Fund. This loan
was initially made in FY 1999/00 to alleviate cash flow issues
experienced by the Facilities Services Sub-Fund. The initial
terms of the loan were for a principal amount of $1.6 million
to be repaid over 10 years with final payment scheduled for FY
2015/16. In FY 2005/06, a large payment was made against
the principal. Payments were then deferred several years due
to insufficient reserves in the Facilities Sub-Fund. The current
schedule restarted repayments in FY 2012/13 and continues
through FY 2016/17.

Fleet Services Sub-Fund
The Fleet Services Program reflects the cost of ownership of
City vehicles and equipment. A primary objective of Fleet
Services is to provide rental rates that are competitive with
those offered in the private sector.
The main source of funding within this sub-fund is derived
from Fleet Services rentals to other programs, which is
primarily based on specific vehicle usage. Fleet Services
rental rates are scheduled to increase by 3.0% for FY 2014/15
and have an average annual increase of 3.3% for the duration
of the first ten years of the long-term plan. These rates have
increased relative to the prior year’s budget mainly due to the
shifting of high cost equipment from the back ten to the front
ten years of the plan. Rate increases in the second ten years
are set at 3.9% annually, equal to the same period in the prior
year.

The multiple transfer line items found within the Current
Resources section of the financial plan through FY 2017/18
represent the funding mechanisms for the Upgrading of the
City’s Fuel Stations capital project. In addition, total transfers
of $71,540 have been programmed in FY 2014/15 from the
Utilities Funds for adding a new truck to the fleet for the water
program, and $21,000 from the Development Enterprise Fund
to acquire a car for the Community Development Department
that will be used for inspections.

The Sale of Property line item of the Financial Plan represents
the sale of surplus or replaced vehicles or pieces of equipment.

The two major current requirements deal with equipment
replacement and operation of the Fleet Services program.

284

This reserve works in tandem with the Equipment Replacement
line item under the Current Requirements section of the SubFund. For example, when a large-value item is scheduled
to be replaced such as a street sweeper or a fire apparatus,
the equipment replacement reserve will be drawn down as
funds are used to purchase the vehicle or apparatus. In this
manner, operating programs do not experience large swings in
expenditures due to fleet replacement.

The Equipment Replacement line item fluctuates each year,
as various items of equipment reach the end of their useful
life and must be replaced. Overall equipment replacement
expenditures are up approximately $1.1 million in the first
ten years of the twenty-year plan in comparison to the prior
twenty-year plan. This is predominantly the result of increased
costs for the replacements of assets that were deferred in
prior years and for special purpose trucks. The replacement
schedule for special purpose trucks increased 17% over the
twenty year plan, driven by accelerating the replacement year
for two aerial fire rigs as well as increasing the cost estimate
for each by 42%. Cost escalations on the fire truck aerials are
primarily due to significant manufacturing cost increases for
the chassis, which include the frame rails and power train, as
well as complex exhaust retrofits required to meet stringent
Tier 4 emission standards. In addition to the new cars for the
Utilities and Development Enterprise Fund mentioned above,
there were also two cars added to the replacement schedule in
FY 2014/15 for the Department of Public Safety.

Facilities Management Services Sub-Fund
The Facilities Management Program reflects the cost of
maintaining City facilities, including costs for janitorial
service, building maintenance, utilities, carpets and blinds,
modular furniture, and building equipment.

Operations expenditures in FY 2014/15 are up slightly over
the twenty year of the long-term plan compared to prior year,
due to additional hours budgeted in the fleet operating program
for a Golf Course Equipment Mechanic that had previously
been budgeted in the Golf and Tennis Fund.

The Facilities Management Sub-Fund has two rental rate
revenue items, one relating to space rental and the other
relating to equipment. Space rental charges are based upon
the total square footage of building space throughout the
City. This square footage is then divided amongst the various
City programs, and operating charges are allocated out based
on a program’s proportion of the total square footage. The
equipment rental accounts for replacement costs associated
with modular furniture, carpet and blinds, and building
maintenance equipment.

The Equipment Replacement Reserve represents the
accumulation of annual rental rates received from City
programs, net of replacements purchased during the current
fiscal year, for future replacement of vehicles and equipment.

The aggregate rental rate for Facilities Management is
scheduled to increase 3.0% for FY 2014/15, with annual
increases declining to 2.5% starting in FY 2023/24. It should
be noted that in FY 2017/18 of the plan, facility rental rates are

285

expected decrease by 6.4%, as Facilities Services will have
paid off its loan to Fleet Services and funds will no longer
need to be collected to cover that liability. This will result
in a reduction in rental rates that will lower the base rental
rate charged for the remainder of the plan years. Rental rate
increases in the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget are flat in
comparison with what was programmed in the FY 2013/14
Adopted Budget. While there is uncertainty on a plan for
rehabilitation or replacement of the City’s large administrative
facilities, limited funds have been expended on these
facilities. This is not a realistic long-term plan and therefore
rental rate increases have been set at an appropriate level. As
a result, until plans are determined, additional revenue will
be collected. Over the twenty years, a total of $9.2 million
in additional facility rental collections will be transferred
to the Infrastructure Fund to increase funding for the future
infrastructure needs of the City; this additional collection is
shown as Additional Transfer to Infrastructure in the longterm plan.

within the Facilities Subfund reflects a 12% increase from the
prior year.

The major current requirements deal with operation of
the Facilities Services Program. The Operations line item
increased slightly for FY 2014/15 in comparison to the FY
2013/14 budget, primarily due to the anticipated increase in
the cost of utilities in the near future. PG&E has indicated to
the City that they project rate increases of between 3% and 7%
for the next two years. The FY 2014/15 budget for electricity

The Transfer to Sunnyvale Office Center line item in the longterm financial plan represents a transfer of rental rate revenues
received from City programs currently housed at the 505 W.
Olive Sunnyvale Office Center. These funds are collected
in this sub-fund and then transferred to the Sunnyvale Office
Center sub-fund to partially fund the facility management
costs associated with that facility. Transfers are also made

Equipment Replacement costs have been established based on
the asset depreciation schedules for carpets and blinds, large
equipment, and modular furniture. The FY 2014/15 long-term
plan reflects slight savings over the 20-year plan for facilitiesrelated equipment in comparison to the long-term plan from
FY 2013/14. This is primarily the result of a continuing
effort to replace only what is necessary as the future of all
City facilities, including the Civic Center and Library, is being
determined.
The Interfund Loan Repayment line item in the financial plan
represents loan payments to the Fleet Services Sub-Fund,
which are projected to be fully repaid in FY 2016/17. As was
mentioned in the Fleet Services section, this loan was made to
alleviate cash flow constraints of the Facilities Services SubFund in FY 1999/00.

to the General Fund to cover the cost of management and
administrative support services for the Facilities program.
Lastly, transfers to the Infrastructure Fund have been
programmed for the Facilities Services’ contribution to various
capital projects, such as improvements at the Corporation
Yard.

increases that was previously planned for the second ten years
in last year’s plan. This is due to increases in equipment
replacement costs that are scheduled in the second ten years.
The Cable PEG Channel Grant line item reflects funds
that are available for use for public or educational cable
services. These funds are used to purchase equipment for
the City’s public access channel, KSUN. Funds that have not
been programmed are collected in a restricted reserve titled
Restricted KSUN Equipment Reserve. These revenues are
allocated to the City based on the City’s share of one percent
of Comcast gross revenues.

The Equipment Reserve represents the accumulation of annual
equipment rental rates received from City programs, net of
replacements purchased during the current fiscal year, for
future replacement of modular furniture, carpets and blinds,
and building maintenance equipment.
Technology and Communications Services Sub-Fund

A surcharge on development fees to pay for the costs of the
technology needed to support the one-stop permit system
was implemented in FY 2010/11. This surcharge is expected
to recover about $90,000 annually and will be placed in a
Restricted Technology Surcharge Reserve in this Sub-Fund. It
will be used to cover the cost of annual system maintenance
on the City’s permitting system, as well as to cover periodic
major upgrades or replacement of the system.

The Technology and Communications Services Sub-Fund
reflects the cost to operate and maintain the City’s technology
and communications program and infrastructure. This includes
technology (hardware and software), communications, and
office equipment. Information technology services, radio
communications, and satellite copiers are provided by the
Information Technology Department, while Print Shop and
Mail Services are provided by the Office of the City Manager.

The Transfer from the General Fund line item represents the
General Fund support to cover the costs for the Information
Technology Department to administer the City’s cable
television franchise agreements since the franchise fee
revenue is collected in the General Fund.

The aggregate rental rate increase for Technology and
Communications Services is scheduled to be 3.8% in FY
2014/15 and then 2.5% annually for the remaining first ten
years of the plan. These increases are unchanged from the
2.5% annual average projected for the first ten years of last
year’s plan. Increases average 2.0% annually in the second
ten years of the plan, which is higher than the 1.5% annual

replacement and operation of the programs in the Information
Technology Department and the Office of the City Manager.
Equipment replacement for technology, communications, and
office assets reflect the equipment replacement schedules for
each type of equipment, and equipment replacement costs
will fluctuate year-over-year based on the useful lives of the
individual pieces of equipment on the replacement schedules.
Overall, equipment replacement costs over the 20-year plan
are slightly higher in comparison to last year’s long-term plan,
primarily due to hardware costs for installation of a fiber optic
system system and higher replacement costs on software for
the financial system.

various capital projects, including improvements at the City
Hall Annex and the emergency generator installations.
The Equipment Replacement Reserve represents the
accumulation of annual rental rates received from City
programs, net of replacements purchased during the current
fiscal year, for future replacement and maintenance of network
infrastructure, central and desktop computers, communication
equipment, software applications, office equipment, and mail
and print shop equipment.
The Restricted KSUN Equipment Reserve reflects PEG Grant
revenues that have been collected but not appropriated for
specific expenditures. PEG Grant funds can only be utilized
for the purchase of KSUN equipment.

Total operating costs for the Technology and Communications
programs are up 1% in the FY 2014/15 long-term plan in
comparison to the prior long-term plan. This is predominantly
the result of increased Salary and Benefit expenses due to the
addition of one net new position for a Programmer Analyst.
The fiscal impact of the additional position is an annual
expense of $156,000, equating to an additional $3.1 million in
costs over the long term financial plan.

The Restricted Tech Surcharge Reserve reflects funds collected
from the Technology Surcharge that is added to development
fees that have not been appropriated for specific expenditures.
Funds are collected in this reserve to cover the cost of ongoing
maintenance and eventual system replacement of the permit
system.

The Transfer to General Fund line has two main components.
$2.1 million is scheduled in FY 2013/14 to pay for the Silicon
Valley Regional Communication System project. Transfers
are also made to the General Fund to cover the cost of
management and administrative support services for the
Print Shop. Additionally, transfers to the Infrastructure Fund
have been programmed throughout the long-term plan for the
Technology and Communications Services’ contribution to

Sunnyvale Office Center Sub-Fund
This sub-fund accounts for the activities of the Sunnyvale
Office Center located at 505 W. Olive Avenue, across from the
main City Hall. The Sunnyvale Office Center was purchased
in April 2001 by the issuance of variable rate Certificates of
Participation (COPs) to provide expansion opportunities for
the Civic Center Complex. Activities included in this fund

288

are maintenance and operations of the office facility, capital
projects, and debt service. Revenues to this sub-fund consist
of rental from outside tenants and City operations, and interest
on reserves.

More recently, interest rates have been extremely low,
resulting in lower than projected debt service payments. The
assumption for FY 2014/15 is that interest rates will increase
but remain low at 1%, before returning to the 3% historical
average in FY 2015/16. The remaining principal amount is
$13.4 million as of the end of FY 2013/14, with the balance
scheduled to be fully repaid by 2031.

When the sub-fund was established, it was projected that
the existing office buildings would be operated and leased
through FY 2005/06, when a long-term solution to the City’s
office space problem would be in place. Subsequently, plans
for a new civic center complex were put on hold because
of the City’s financial situation. Currently, options for the
development and implementation of a long-term solution to
the City’s office space issues are continuing to be explored.
As such, the FY 2014/15 long-term financial plan continues to
reflect the complex being operated for the entire twenty-year
planning period. Increasing the length of operation causes the
office complex to generate more net income than originally
anticipated, and this allows the Sunnyvale Office Center
Fund to give a rebate to the General Fund of about $258,000
annually, increasing at the rate of growth in rental income,
over the entire planning period.

This Sunnyvale Office Center Sub-Fund has two reserves. The
first is the required Debt Service Reserve, which maintains a
balance of approximately $1.2 million. The second reserve
is the Capital Projects Reserve. This reserve was funded by
an $11 million transfer of surplus revenues from the General
Fund in 2002. These funds were originally to be used to
purchase the Office Center before the City decided to finance
the purchase. The purpose of this reserve is to generate
interest to offset debt service, as well as to fund ongoing
capital improvements. The reserve balance at the end of FY
2013/14 is projected to be $9.5 million.
Project Management Sub-Fund
The Project Management Sub-Fund represents project
management services provided by staff within the Department
of Public Works Capital Project Management Program.
These services are associated with the various capital and
infrastructure projects currently incorporated within the City’s
projects budget. The transfers into this fund represent a fund’s
proportionate share based on the current schedule of projects
budgeted for a given year in that fund.

Because of the age and general condition of the office
buildings, some infrastructure improvements are programmed
over the twenty-year planning period. These projects are
necessary in order to keep the facility in working order.
The interest paid on our COPs is variable and based on market
conditions, but since their issuance has averaged 3% annually.

289

The Capital Project Management Program is responsible
for administrative oversight efforts on all City projects that
involve the development and management of construction
contracts. Budgeting for project management administration
is based upon the timing of projects by funding source over
the twenty-year long-term plan. Major projects, such as the
reconstruction of the Water Pollution Control Plant, and larger,
grant-funded projects are excluded because program staff
charge their time directly to these projects, which allows us to
take advantage of eligible grant reimbursement opportunities
for project administration charges.

better track and analyze expenditures, the Fund is separated
into four sub-funds: Leaves, Retirement Benefits, Workers’
Compensation, and Insurance and Other Benefits.
In general, the additive rate that is charged to cover the costs
of employee benefits is calculated by determining the amount
of the benefit to be accrued, and dividing that amount into
total budgeted salaries. Depending on total hours worked
over the course of the fiscal year, the Employee Benefits
Fund may over-collect in some years and under-collect in
other years in comparison to budgeted amounts. Annual rate
adjustments take this into account, and reserves in this Fund
are set to factor in year-over-year fluctuations. Combined
reserves are projected to end FY 2013/14 at $13.7 million,
and build to a total of $41.3 million at the end of the twentyyear plan. Over the twenty-year plan, the overall additive
rate for Miscellaneous employees is on average 3.2% higher
than the rate set in the prior plan; for Safety employees, the
overall additive rate is 3.9% higher. This is primarily due to
higher retirement and insurance costs, which are discussed in
further detail below. With the strategic setting of rates over
the twenty-year plan, the City is on track to pay off its Other
Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) liability by FY 2030/31,
and maintain a reserve for potential increases to future
retirement contribution rates, which is explained in detail in
the Retirement Benefits section below.

Operations for the Project Administration Sub-Fund are
budgeted to increase by approximately 2% in FY 2014/15.
In FY 2012/13, the Program added three additional full-time
positions and one additional full-time position was added in
FY 2013/14, reflecting the emphasis the City is putting on the
capital projects program to address the backlog of projects
requiring this group’s services. As budgeted project costs
taper off starting in FY 2019/20, the budget for this program is
reduced accordingly.

▪▪ Employee Benefits and Insurance Fund
The Employee Benefits and Insurance Fund provides a
mechanism to cover expenditures related to pension costs,
insurance plans, workers’ compensation costs, and leave time
while applying the principles of full-cost accounting. This
is accomplished by charging an additive rate to staff salaries
wherever personnel hours are budgeted and expended. To

Leaves Benefits
The Leaves program accounts for all City employees’ leave
time, including accrual of leave benefits earned but not taken.

the Safety 3% @ 50 plan. The second tier consists of new
employees that are existing CalPERS members who were
hired after December 23, 2012 (Miscellaneous) and July 1,
2012 (Safety). These employees are on the Miscellaneous 2%
@ 60 plan, or the Safety 3% @ 55 plan. Finally, the third tier
consists of new members to CalPERS as of January 1, 2013.
These employees are on the Miscellaneous 2% @ 62 plan, or
the Safety 2% @ 50 plan.

This method of accruing for leave benefits as they are earned
and recognizing the liability up-front is fiscally prudent, as it
provides the City with adequate funding to pay off significant
earned leave amounts at employee separations.
Beginning in FY 2014/15, Floating Holiday Leave and
Management Administrative Leave will no longer be budgeted
in the City’s operating programs, but will be budgeted in
the Leave Benefits sub-fund with all the other City leaves.
Overall, this is an additional $1 million per year in costs that
has been factored into the overall leave additive rate, which
increases the leave additive in FY 2014/15 by nearly 2% over
FY 2013/14 rates. It should be noted, however, that the net
impact to the City’s total budget is flat since these leave hours
have been removed from program operating budgets.

The cost to fund the CalPERS retirement benefit is broken
down into two contributions, the employer contribution and the
employee contribution. For current Miscellaneous and Safety
employees (tiers one and two), the employee contribution rate
is set by law: 8% of pay for the Miscellaneous 2.7% @ 55
plan, 7% for the Miscellaneous 2% @ 60 plan, and 9% for
the Safety 3% at 50 plan. For many years, the City has paid
the employee contribution but employees have begun to pick
up a part of their contribution in the last several years. For
FY 2014/15, the City’s contribution for the employee share
will be 4% (Miscellaneous) and 8.25% (Safety) of pay. The
FY 2014/15 Budget, consistent with the prior year budget,
assumes tier one and two employees will contribute their
full employee share by FY 2018/19 (Miscellaneous) and FY
2019/20 (Safety, excluding a 2.25% employee cost share
paid by the City). It should be noted that these increases
must be negotiated with the bargaining units. However,
beginning on January 1, 2018, PEPRA allows a public agency
to unilaterally require all members to pay up to 50% of the
normal cost of their pension benefits, after bargaining in good
faith and impasse procedures have completed. The employee

Interest income is generated from accrued leaves, which are
held on the City’s General Ledger until it is taken.
Retirement Benefits
Retirement Benefits consists of the costs for the City’s
retirement plans. By City Charter, Sunnyvale has contracted
with the California Public Employees Retirement System
(CalPERS) to provide retirement benefits for its employees.
With the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act
of 2013 (PEPRA), effective January 1, 2013, the City now has
three pension tiers for Miscellaneous and Safety employees.
The first tier consists of existing employees who were
employed with the City prior to December 23, 2012. These
employees remain on the Miscellaneous 2.7% @ 55 plan, or

291

contribution rate can be increased up to 8% for miscellaneous
members and 12% for Safety members. Tier three employees,
under PEPRA, must pay half their normal cost at the end of
any existing contracts, or by January 1, 2018.

and losses over a rolling thirty-year period calculated on the
actuarial value of assets. While this reduced fluctuations in
employer rates, it also meant that the City not paying down
our unfunded liability and in fact the liability was growing as
the amortization schedule was reset every year. In order to
more aggressively pay down the unfunded liability, the City
has been paying CalPERS more than the required contribution
with rates developed with the City’s consulting actuary. For
FY 2013/14, staff requested a “fresh start” with CalPERS that
took all the unfunded liability to date and amortized it over
a set number of years. For the City’s Miscellaneous Plans it
was 18 years and for the Safety Plans it was 28 years.

While the employee contribution rate is set by law, the
employer contribution rate is adjusted annually by CalPERS
through an actuarial analysis which considers demographic
information and investment earnings. The contribution rates
are applied against employee salaries (PERSable earnings) in
order to calculate the dollar amounts the City must contribute.
Over the past decade, employer contribution rates have
increased significantly, predominantly due to the significant
market losses experienced in the early 2000s and in FY
2008/09. Other factors contributing to the sharp increase in
contribution rates have been enhanced pension benefits for
employees, applied retroactively, and changes in actuarial
experience (i.e. employees retiring earlier at higher salaries
and living longer in retirement). In March 2012, CalPERS
lowered the long-term rate of return from 7.75% to 7.5%. In
February 2014, the CalPERS board adopted future mortality
improvements to be included in actuarial assumptions. The
improved mortality assumptions will significantly increase the
cost of pensions, impacting the contribution rates beginning in
FY 2016/17.

CalPERS also had concerns with their amortization and rate
smoothing policies and in April 2013, changed its policies to
employ a fixed thirty-year amortization period with increases
and decreases in the rate spread directly over a five-year
period. These policy changes will go into effect with the
FY 2015/16 rates. With the City’s consulting actuary, staff
incorporated the estimated impacted of these changes, as
well as the changes for mortality improvement, into the longterm financial plan last year. As a result, the City has already
started to build to the anticipated increases in rates that will be
coming over the next six years.
Because of the fresh start and CalPERS’ new amortization
and rate smoothing policies, the City no longer needs to
contribute more than the required contribution. Therefore, the
FY 2014/15 employer rates are set to the CalPERS required
contribution. This rate is less than the estimated assumption

As significantly as rates were increasing over the last several
years, staff also realized they were not going up enough.
CalPERS’ actuarial methodology amortized investment gains

292

last year for FY 2014/15; however, rates over the long-term
will be higher than last year’s assumptions. This is because
the consulting actuary estimated the impacts of the policy
changes being made by CalPERS which are now known and
slightly different than estimated.

Projected City Paid Retirement Contribution Rate
While the new CalPERS policies set retirement plans on the
appropriate funding path, they will also increase volatility
on a year-to-year basis. Because of this volatility, as well as
uncertainty about other possible future rate increases, staff
has set the retirement additive rate slightly higher than the
budgeted contribution rates over the twenty-year plan in order
to build reserves.

As the chart below shows, over the next six years (by FY
2019/20), this budget includes employer contribution rates
that are estimated to increase 37% for Miscellaneous plans
and 41% for Safety plans.

Fiscal Year

The PERS Rate Uncertainty Reserve is budgeted to end with
$17 million over the twenty-year plan to mitigate for any
further unanticipated increases to the contribution rates. While
these are one-time funds that are gone once drawn down, they
do allow large rate increases to be smoothed in over several
years, which helps maintain stable operating costs.

Miscellaneous

Workers’ Compensation
Workers’ Compensation benefits are funded through the use
of an additive rate that is applied to all staff salaries. This
additive rate is based upon actual usage of the City’s Workers’
Compensation program. For this reason, the City charges a
variable additive rate depending upon the classification of the
employee. In other words, high-risk positions, such as a Public
Safety Officer, are charged a higher rate than administrative
employees.

Safety

293

miscellaneous employees. As such, beginning with FY
2014/15, ongoing projected leave hours are decreased
significantly to reflect this minimal usage. Therefore, the
majority of leave hours, 96%, are budgeted for Safety
employees. The expense related to these leave hours increases
with projected salary increases, weighted by employee group,
throughout the twenty-year plan.

Since FY 2004/05, the number of claims was on a decreasing
trend, but began to increase beginning in FY 2012/13. In FY
2013/14, the expected number of claims is expected to be 143,
which represents a 39% increase to the 103 claims submitted
in FY 2012/13. While there is not one overriding reason for
this increase in the number of claims, most injuries in FY
2013/14 to date occurred in the Department of Public Safety.
As such, the Risk Management division is working closely
with the Department of Public Safety to reduce the frequency
and severity of workplace injuries.

Because Workers’ Compensation Insurance is based on
total salary, the costs for this expense over the long term
are increased in accordance with the assumed increase
in salaries throughout the planning period. The cost of
claims administration, which is performed by a third party
administrator, is assumed to go up approximately 3% annually
based on the contract.

In addition to the number of claims, the cost per claim has
risen due to rising medical costs and severity of the claims.
The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget projects the cost of
claims will be approximately $2.3 million in FY 2014/15.
The FY 2014/15 claims estimate is based upon the City’s most
recent actuarial analysis. Going forward, the long-term plan
reflects a 2.5% annual increase in the cost of claims, which
aligns with current actuarial assumptions.

Due to the continuing trend of increasing average claim
costs, FY 2014/15 reserve requirements continue to remain
at the level budgeted for in FY 2013/14. The Worker’s
Compensation reserve requirement is based on the most recent
actuarial analysis, completed in December 2013, and has been
set at $13.5 million for FY 2014/15; this is relatively flat to
the $13.4 million reserve requirement in the FY 2013/14
budget. Similar to the FY 2013/14 budget, this reserve is
gradually increased to that amount by FY 2017/18 to avoid
a significant increase to additive rates for FY 2014/15.
Actuarial valuations of the Workers’ Compensation Program
are conducted each year in order to satisfy the City’s financial

Workers’ compensation leave costs are projected throughout
the long-term financial plan based on historical actual usage.
Leave hours have fluctuated historically and underscore the
importance of managing these leaves closely to minimize
time off and ensure timely resolution of issues. With the
adoption of the latest Sunnyvale Employees’ Association
(SEA) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Workers’
Compensation leave usage will be minimal for most

adjusted as appropriate.

increases are set lower after the two years to 8%, and then 5%
beginning FY 2017/18 to the end of the twenty-year plan.

Insurance and Other Benefits

Conversely, the twenty-year plan projects a savings of $8.5
million in retiree healthcare premiums. For calendar year
2014 premiums, CalPERS implemented a new risk adjustment
process that eliminated premium differences that existed
because of member health status. This resulted in a 33.5%
decrease in premiums to a plan in which many retirees are
enrolled. As this new risk adjustment process will remain
in effect for future years, CalPERS does not anticipate the
premiums will adjust back upward. The number of retirees
is estimated to grow by an average of 25 new retirees each
year in the twenty-year plan. Staff has taken steps to contain
medical costs in recent years for both active and retired
employees. Caps on City contributions were placed on both
active and retired management employees beginning in FY
2007/08, and a 5% cap on increases to medical premiums is in
effect for Sunnyvale Employees Association (SEA) retirees.

The Insurance and Other Benefits Program includes costs for
all the employee insurance plans including medical, dental,
vision and life insurance. As with the other employee benefits
programs, costs for their administration are contained in a
Human Resources program in the General Fund and supported
by indirect general administration overhead charges to the
other funds.
The largest cost in this program is medical insurance for
City employees, which is provided by CalPERS. Over
the twenty-year plan, the cost for medical insurance is
expected to be nearly $12.1 million higher in the FY 2014/15
Recommended Budget compared to the prior long-term plan.
This is primarily due to higher than historical medical cost
increase assumptions in 2015 and 2016. A 10% increase is
budgeted for both calendar years 2015 and 2016 (compared to
a historical increase of 8%). These increases are built into this
plan to account for anticipated medical premium increases, as
well as projected increases in the number of City employees,
as we are currently at historically low headcount levels.
Medical premium increases are anticipated from geographic
pricing model changes by CalPERS and impacts from the
Affordable Care Act. Additionally, an anticipated increase in
the number of employees over the next two years will result
in more employees needing insurance coverage. Medical cost

Managing retiree medical costs is particularly important
with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB)
Statement No. 45, which requires the City to disclose our
liability for other post-employment benefits (OPEB) such as
retiree medical costs beginning with the year ended June 30,
2008. To address the growing long-term medical costs seen
in our actuarial valuations for our retiree medical liability,
the City began funding a retiree medical trust fund in FY
2010/11 with an initial $32.6 million contribution. Through

295

FY 2013/14, the City has contributed a total of $45.7 million
to the trust. As of February 2014, the City has earned $5.8 on
the contributions, and the trust has a market value of $53.8
million. By contributing to a retiree medical trust fund, the
City will derive many benefits, including the reduction of
future employer OPEB costs, as the earnings generated from
trust fund investments will eventually be utilized to offset
ongoing costs for the retiree medical insurance. Additionally,
it will prevent OPEB obligations from being a significant
liability on our balance sheets.

The Liability and Property Insurance Fund is funded
through transfers from its dependent funds rather than on
an additive rate basis. The transfers are based on liability
claims experience in recent years for liability costs and City
property valuations for property insurance related costs.
Insurance coverage is applied to the maintenance of the City’s
infrastructure and covers the City against claims such as trip
and fall, vehicle damage, and damage caused by City trees.
Currently, the City participates in a risk pool administered
by the California Joint Powers Risk Management Authority
(CJPRMA), which provides insurance over the City’s Self
Insured Retention (SIR) level of $500,000 per claim. City
staff also currently participates on its Board of Directors. The
total amount paid for liability claims under $500,000 can vary
significantly from year-to-year.

As of the latest actuarial valuation dated June 30, 2012, the
City’s OPEB liability is expected to be 42% funded by the end
of FY 2013/14 and remains on track to be fully paid off by FY
2030/31.
There is also an Insurance Rate Uncertainty Reserve
that provides funds for several uncertainties, including
unanticipated changes in premium costs and adjustments
to the City’s contribution costs. This assists in levelizing
additive rates over the long term.

In the FY 2013/14 budget, a total of approximately $346,000
was budgeted for legal costs in the Liability Fund ($82,000
for tort litigation) and General Fund ($264,000 for non-tort
litigation). For the FY 2014/15 budget, the total budget for
legal costs has increased to approximately $564,000, with
$453,100 budgeted for tort litigation in the Liability Fund,
and $111,000 in the General Fund for non-tort litigation. The
decrease in the non-tort litigation budget and the increase in
the tort-litigation budget is based on actual expenditures in
the past five years, resulting in a net increase of $218,000.
The $453,100 budgeted in the Liability Fund for FY 2014/15
consists of an annual budget for tort litigation of $313,100
and a one-time legal contingency of $140,000. While actual

expenditures on tort litigation in the past five years have
averaged $313,100 a year, there can be significant variances
in any single year. As such, a legal contingency of $140,000
has been budgeted to help absorb cost overages in any given
year. This is intended to be a lump sum appropriation to be
used when legal costs exceed the $310,000 annual budget,

were budgeted in FY 2012/13 that were not incurred until FY
2013/14. Currently, the infrastructure has not been completed
and it is anticipated that the facilities will be transferred to the
City by the end of June 2014.
Ongoing annual operating costs of $18,423 are included in
the operating budget starting in FY 2014/15. These will be
funded by annual assessment revenues, which will cover the
annual operating cost and also provide for replacement costs
scheduled in ten, thirty, and sixty year intervals. For the
FY 2014/15 twenty-year plan, the reserves are strategically
increased to cover two ten-year infrastructure replacement
improvements, the first of which is planned for FY 2022/23
and the second in FY 2032/33.

The reserve in this fund meets the recommended actuarially
acceptable funding level as provided in an actuarial review of
the program completed in December 2013.

▪▪ Community Facilities District No. 3 Fund

▪▪ Redevelopment Successor Agency Fund

In FY 2012/13, a new community facilities district (CFD)
was formed. This new CFD (City of Sunnyvale Community
Facilities District No. 3, Estates at Sunnyvale) will finance the
maintenance and replacement of publicly-owned infrastructure
and other improvements planned for in a 10-acre residential
subdivision located at 770 Timberpine Avenue.

In an effort to balance its budget in 2011, the State of
California adopted legislation to dissolve all redevelopment
agencies. As a result, all redevelopment agencies, including
the Sunnyvale Redevelopment Agency (RDA), were legally
dissolved on February 1, 2012.

The developer contribution in FY 2012/13 totaled $49,455.
These were appropriated to a new project, Formation of
Community Facilities District No. 3 to cover any noncontingent startup costs of forming the CFD, as well as the
first six months of the annual operations, maintenance, and
servicing costs of the bio-retention basins and associated
facilities. Actual expenditures during FY 2012/13 totaled only
$21,907. This was primarily due to certain startup costs that

The City elected to serve as the Successor Agency to the
former RDA, overseeing the wind down process, subject
to the control of a newly established Sunnyvale Oversight
Board. The Oversight Board consists of seven representatives
made up of members from the City of Sunnyvale, the County
of Santa Clara and local education and special districts within
the Redevelopment Project Area. The actions of the Oversight

297

Board are overseen by the State Department of Finance (DOF)
and are subject to disapproval or modification.

A final determination has not been made on the loan
repayments to the General Fund. The Dissolution Law
specifically excludes most types of agreements between a
redevelopment agency and its sponsoring community as an
enforceable obligation after it is dissolved. However, followup dissolution legislation adopted in June of 2012, may allow
the City to recover some of the loan repayments. Because a
determination has not been made at the time the budget was
being prepared, the FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget does
not include loan repayments.

A critical piece of the wind down process is the determination
of enforceable obligations for payment from the former
property tax increment allocation. While Debt service
obligations for the Central Core Redevelopment Project Tax
Allocation Bonds (TABs) and the reimbursement of lease
payments for the Parking Facility Certificates of Participation
(COPs) are recognized as enforceable obligations in the
Dissolution Law, DOF has denied the COPs payments
because the payments are pledged by lease rental payments
required by the City. The lease arrangement with the City is
a typical financing arrangement for COPs where a repayment
agreement provides the funds for the lease payments, which in
turn are used for debt service payments. At this time, DOF has
not recognized the RDA’s repayment contract with the City as
eligible for payment from property tax increment.

On May 23, 2013, the Successor Agency filed suit
challenging DOF’s interpretation that the City is not entitled
to reimbursement of loan payments related to the financing
of the original Town Center parking facilities. In response,
Santa Clara County Counsel on behalf of two school districts
filed a counter lawsuit against the Successor Agency. As a
result, $14 million in repayments that were made to the City
prior to dissolution of the RDA are at risk in addition to future
repayments. Both lawsuits are scheduled to be heard together
on April 25, 2014. The City’s General Fund sets aside the full
amount to be prepared for the worst case scenario.

Obligations of the 2010 Amended Disposition and
Development and Owner Participation Agreement
(ADDOPA), the current development agreement for the Town
Center project, are enforceable obligations. This includes cost
sharing for the environmental remediation of the site and the
property tax sharing agreement. As part of the ADDOPA,
the RDA agreed to return to the developer up to $4.5 million
per year of property tax increment generated by the project
plus 50% of any receipts above this amount, in return for
construction of the public infrastructure (streets and parking
structures), through FY 2025/26.

The FY 2014/15 Recommended Budget presents a financial
plan for the Redevelopment Successor Agency’s approved
enforceable obligations. The plan includes debt service
payments for the TABs, amounts owing to the Housing Fund,
funding for special projects related to wind down process,
environmental remediation payments and projected property
tax sharing payments (past accrued tax sharing payments and

298

on-going) under the terms of the ADDOPA. The developer is
not eligible to receive tax sharing payments until a milestone
is met, projected in FY 2017/18.

has contracted with California Sports Center (CSC), which
has operated the Fremont Pool under a license agreement
since 2002. City staff conducted a competitive Request for
Proposals (RFP) to select a provider for pool operations
beginning September 2013 and found CSC to be the most
qualified operator for continuing pool operations.

The financial plan also includes administrative expenses. The
Dissolution Law allows for reimbursement of administrative
expenses, up to a cap. It should also be noted that
administrative expenses are the last in line to be reimbursed
from the former property tax increment allocation. Therefore,
if there are not enough funds to cover the administrative
expenses, the General Fund would have to absorb these costs.
Further, once the Redevelopment Successor Agency is fully
wound down, all administrative costs that had previously been
paid by tax increment will revert to the General Fund. These
additional costs have been reflected in the General Fund longterm financial plan.

The City’s cost is determined by adding 50% of the cost of
maintaining the pool itself (performed by the School District,
which subsequently bills the City), 100% of the City’s cost of
maintaining the public shower/locker facility, and staff costs
related to oversight of the contract. The City’s projected cost
for Fremont Pool maintenance for FY 2014/15 is $207,311.
Interest earnings on the Fremont Pool Trust Fund are projected
to be $7,339 and reflect the continued extremely low interest
environment that we are currently experiencing. The Trust
earnings pay approximately 3.5% of the City’s annual costs.
Revenues from operation of the Fremont Pool are projected to
be $51,250 for FY 2014/15 or 24.7% of total cost. The General
Fund makes up the difference. In addition to operations and
maintenance costs, the City also funds a project for the City’s
share of Fremont Pool infrastructure improvements.

▪▪ Fremont Pool Endowment (Trust) Fund
The Fremont Pool Trust Fund was established by the City
in FY 2002/03 to account for the receipt of monies raised
by The Friends of Fremont Pool, a group of residents who
lobbied City Council regarding the need for a new pool in
Sunnyvale. The Fund has an Endowment Reserve balance of
$1,048,435 as of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014. The
basic premise of this fund is that the corpus, or principal, is
never expended, but invested with the interest generated
each year used to help offset the City’s cost of operating the
50-meter pool constructed in partnership with the Fremont
Union High School District at Fremont High School. The City

It should also be noted that while the corpus of this fund may
grow a bit in future years (assuming continued contributions),
it is not expected to increase markedly over time. As a result,
it is not expected to keep up with inflation and the purchasing
power of the interest it generates will likely erode over time.
In this context, it is critical to note the importance of allowing
the pool’s operator to charge market rates for use of the pool.

299

It is also important to allow the operator to determine effective
revenue-producing programming. The net revenue received
by the City, and the interest generated by the Fremont Pool
Trust Fund, are critical factors in allowing the pool to partially
support itself financially.

For FY 2014/15, it is recommended that the full amount of
interest earned from the Swirsky Trust (approximately $3,864)
be used toward youth at-risk programming in the Columbia
Neighborhood service area, operated by the Department of
Library and Community Services.

▪▪ Dorolou P. Swirsky Youth Opportunity Fund
In August 1993, City Council accepted Dorolou Swirsky’s
intent to donate her house upon her death to provide an
endowment to specifically address sports, recreational, social,
cultural, and educational activities for disadvantaged youth
living in Sunnyvale.
The Dorolou Swirsky Trust Estate was donated to the City
upon her death in March 2000. The estate consisted of a single
family home located at 1133 Hollenbeck Road. Following the
donation, the City established the Swirsky Youth Opportunity
Fund to account for the proceeds. Ms. Swirsky had taken a
reverse mortgage on the property which the City paid upon
her death using General Fund monies. The property was
rented out until August 2003 with net proceeds used to help
pay back the General Fund for the reverse mortgage.
In November 2003, Council approved a resolution authorizing
the sale of 1133 Hollenbeck Road. The house was subsequently
sold, the remainder of the General Fund advance was paid,
and an endowment of $526,595 was established.

Community Development
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The Community Development Department oversees all land use policy planning and development
review in the City, and administers and enforces the Sunnyvale Municipal Codes and other
government regulations related to the physical development of the City. A core function of the
Department is administering the One-Stop Permit Center, which offers coordinated customer
services related to zoning information and approvals, development applications, and building
permits. The Department also administers the distribution of federal and City assistance funds
for human services, and for affordable housing production and preservation. In addition, the
Department provides staff support to four City Boards and Commissions: Planning, Housing and
Human Services, Heritage Preservation, and Building Code Appeals.

Programs and Services
The Community Development Department is organized into four programs: Building Safety,
Planning, Housing/Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), and Department Management.
In addition, the Department oversees the local Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process for
the Onizuka Air Force Station. The Department serves a wide range of clients including residents,
businesses, property owners, design professionals, and contractors.
The Department’s mission statement is as follows: “The Department of Community Development
is innovative in promoting sustainable development while enhancing the economy, community
character and quality of life in Sunnyvale.” Delivering excellent customer service is a core goal
of the Department, and staff is committed to: 1) delivering high quality products and services; 2)
creating efficient and effective processes; and 3) fostering a supportive and collaborative work
environment. The Development Processing Improvement Committee (DPIC), consisting of City
staff from multiple departments, will continue to identify and implement improvements to the
development review process.

Building Safety Program
The Building Safety Program is responsible for managing construction permits and inspections for
compliance with local and state building regulations. Building permits and plans are reviewed and
approved through the One-Stop Permit Center, as well as through the City’s web-based e-permitting
system for minor permits. The Program is largely responsible for ensuring the efficient operation
of the One–Stop Permit Center, which provides centralized customer service with staffing from
multiple City departments.
Another key responsibility of the Building Safety Program is to provide timely construction
inspections to ensure compliance with approved building plans. In addition, Building staff provides

401

Community Development
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

technical support to homeowners, contractors, and design professionals on the latest building code
regulations. The Program is taking the lead on implementing the City’s green building ordinance
and the California Green Building Code (CALGreen). The Program staff also provides support to
the Board of Building Code Appeals.
The Building Safety Program has earned a reputation for expedited plan review and permit issuance,
and for superior inspection services that support customer construction schedules. This reputation
derives from the Program’s emphasis on customer service at the One-Stop Permit Center, which
includes a goal of 90% of all building plans (express reviews) being reviewed within one day,
depending on the workload. Initial review of all other building plans (regular reviews) have a
goal of being completed within 21 calendar days. In order to support construction schedules, the
Program also prioritizes timely inspections. Most building inspections can be scheduled just one
business day in advance.

Planning Program
The Planning Program encompasses all policy planning and zoning approvals for the conservation
and physical development of the City. The goal of the Program is to improve the quality of life
and physical appearance of the City, and to foster orderly development through comprehensive
and effective policy planning. Program activities include administering the City’s General Plan, as
well as preparing and overseeing specific plans and other land use policy documents. Additionally,
lead responsibility for reporting on many of the City Council adopted study issues rests with
the Planning Program. Planning staff collects and monitors community indicators to measure the
City’s progress in achieving its goals and policies. Major functions of the Program are coordinating
and processing development applications for planning permits, and administering and enforcing
the City’s Zoning Code.

Housing/CDBG Program
The primary objectives of the Housing/CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) Program
are to: 1) increase the development of new and renovated affordable housing; 2) preserve and
improve housing conditions for lower income residents; and 3) provide support to human service
organizations that serve low income and special needs populations in the community.
The Housing Division administers various housing programs, including the Home Improvement,
Below Market Rate Housing, First-time Home Buyer, and Tenant-Based Rental Assistance
Programs. The Division also manages three special revenue funds and their associated loan

402

Community Development
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

portfolios: the Housing Mitigation Fund, the CDBG Fund (which includes the CDBG Housing
Rehabilitation Revolving Loan Fund), and the HOME Program Fund. Two of these funds, CDBG
and HOME, were established to receive the City’s federal entitlement grants, which have provided
an average of nearly $2 million annually for the past decade. These grants fund affordable
housing projects and community development programs for the City’s lower-income residents and
neighborhoods. The Division ensures that the grants are used in a timely manner in accordance
with the federal grant terms.
In addition to operating housing programs, the Division manages a number of large capital
projects funded by the three special revenue funds. These projects primarily consist of multifamily housing development, acquisition, or rehabilitation. The Division also manages smaller
public infrastructure and public facility projects, and annual grants for human services and other
miscellaneous community development activities. The Housing Division provides staff support to
the Housing and Human Services Commission, and coordinates with other divisions on housing
policy development and on long-range planning to meet regional housing needs.

Onizuka Air Force Base
Department staff oversees the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process for Onizuka Air
Force Station. The BRAC planning process is overseen by the City Council acting as the Local
Redevelopment Authority (LRA). In December 2011, the LRA completed the planning phase of the
BRAC process by approving an Amended Redevelopment Plan and Amended Housing Assistance
Submission, and Legally Binding Agreement (LBA) with two homeless housing providers. In
early 2013, the various parcels were conveyed to Foothill De Anza Community College District,
Department of Veterans Affairs and the City in accordance with the Amended Redevelopment Plan.
Additionally, the two homeless housing claims were transferred to the City-owned Armory site.
Upcoming activities for FY 2014/15 involve executing a land exchange with Jay Paul Company to
build a new fire station/public safety facility on an approximately 2-acre parcel at the Moffett Place
Office Campus in accordance to an approved development agreement. The City Council will also
discuss the possible disposition or public use of the former homeless housing parcels.

Department Management
Department Management provides overall leadership and management of the Community
Development Department. Activities include budgeting, work programming, personnel
administration, and general support for the City Manager’s Office, City Clerk, and the City
Executive Leadership Team.

Community Development
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
FY 2014/15 is the first year of a two-year operating budget cycle. No substantial changes to the
Department’s budget are proposed from the previous year’s budget. The operating budget for
the Community Development Department primarily funds personnel costs, which account for
approximately 95% of its total budget. Revenue from planning and building fees support a large
portion of the Department’s operations. Additionally, operational costs for the Housing/CDBG
Program are funded entirely with special purpose federal and City funds.
Development activity in FY 2014/15 is projected to continue at a high level similar to the past
several years as office and residential development continues at a robust pace. This continuing
activity reflects the strength of the Silicon Valley economy and the desirability of Sunnyvale as a
place for business and residential growth. Based on historical records, it is rare to see this level of
development activity sustained for multiple years. But development activity is expected to continue
at nearly this pace into FY 2014/15 based on the projects that are currently undergoing Planning
and Building Division review. This will translate to a substantially higher amount of collected
development fees than the historic average. Development activity is diverse and covers all sectors
including new for-sale and rental housing, new office buildings, commercial and industrial tenant
improvements and single-family remodels. Construction is occurring at many sites in the City
including Moffett Park, Peery Park, East Sunnyvale Industrial-To-Residential (ITR) area, and El
Camino Real corridor. Major projects that are expected to be completed or under construction
in FY 2014/15 include the LinkedIn campus in Peery Park, the Google and Moffett Place office
projects in Moffett Park, and mixed used residential developments in the downtown area and along
El Camino Real. Several hotels are also expected to be completed in FY 2014/15.
In 2013, the City Council approved establishing an enterprise fund to contain all revenues and
expenditures associated with development review permitting. Beginning in FY 2014/15 all
development review functions of the Community Development Department (the entire Building
Division budget and approximately 60% of Planning Division budget) will be transferred into a
newly created Development Enterprise Fund. Additionally, activities associated with development
review in other departments (e.g. Public Works, Public Safety, and the City Attorney) will also be
transferred into the Enterprise Fund. While this move does not represent an organizational change,
all City budgeted revenues and expenditures pertaining to development review will be captured in
this Enterprise Fund. This will allow the City to more closely monitor expenditures and revenues
for this function with the goal of maintaining full cost recovery through the development fees
collected to fund associated City services.

Building Safety Program
The Building Division is operating at a base level of staffing with 16 full-time employees
supplemented with part-time contract inspectors to respond to the heavy workload. One additional

405

Community Development
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

building inspector position was added in FY 2013/14 to respond to the increase in construction
activity throughout the city. The Building Program continues to be fully funded (100% cost
recovery) by plan check and construction inspection fees collected from building permit activity.
Given its commitment to excellent service delivery, the Program’s staffing level will continue to be
monitored to ensure it can be responsive to customer service needs, and to ensure that the Program’s
high performance standards will continue to be met. With the sustained level of construction
activity as reflected in the table below, additional resources for plan checking and inspections have
been maintained to meet the service levels. Contract hours continue to be budgeted in the Building
Safety Program for this purpose. FY 2014/15 includes the addition of 500 staff hours to improve
the oversight and efficiency of construction inspections for installation and monitoring of on-site
stormwater pollution and prevention measures to meet the requirements of the Regional Water
Quality Control Board (RWQCB). These construction inspections will be closely coordinated with
the Department of Environmental Services which serves as the lead department for the stormwater
program.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Planning Program
Over time the annual number of planning permits has increased slightly. This increase is evident
even though some regulations have changed to reduce the number of land uses that require permits
(e.g. certain front yard fences). At the same time, new procedures and regulations have been adopted
making planning reviews more complex (e.g. stormwater, land use near streams, larger noticing
areas, more detailed environmental reviews, parking management plans, etc.). The following chart
shows planning permit activity since FY 1999/00. Supplemental staffing was approved in July
2013 to respond to the increased workload that includes an unusually high number of complex
projects, including several EIRs; in addition, several developers have agreed to fund contract staff
to assist with development review of their projects. Development reviews include checking for
compliance with the City’s zoning code and various design guidelines; environmental review;
sensitivity to adjacent uses; and, compliance with federal, state, and regional standards. Staff time
budgeted to review and process permit applications is based on historical activity, with adjustments
for recent and anticipated streamlining efforts. Additionally, hours/expenses budgeted to address
City and intergovernmental policies are essentially unchanged. The FY 2014/15 budget includes
500 hours for a part-time clerical position to support the data management associated with an
upgraded permit management system. The Planning Division budget is for 14 full-time and two
part-time staff members. The Planning Division performance indicators have also been adjusted
to more accurately monitor the processing of development applications and service delivery.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Policy planning activities for the budget cycle include completing the Land Use and Transportation
Element, Lawrence Station Area Plan, Toolkit for Mixed Used Development and the Peery Park
Specific Plan. Additionally, comprehensive re-organization and revision of the Zoning Code will
be completed to simplify and streamline the zoning regulations. Additionally, General Plan funds
will be reserved to initiate several long overdue updates to the Noise and Air Quality Elements
of the General Plan. Continuing activities include closely coordinating with state and regional
agencies and neighboring cities on new legislation, programs, and development activities that
affect Sunnyvale residents and businesses. The Planning Division will also continue to provide
staff support to the Planning Commission and Heritage Preservation Commission.

Housing Program
The Housing/CDBG Program is funded entirely with special purpose funds: CDBG and HOME
federal grant funds, Below Market Rate Program In-Lieu Fees, and Housing Mitigation Fees,
which are development impact fees paid for by developers of large, new employment-generating
developments. All Program operating and capital project expenditures are funded by the special
revenue funds. Use of each fund is regulated by federal laws and regulations and/or by adopted
City policies. The largest expenditures in the Housing/CDBG Program are usually within the
City’s capital projects budget rather than its operating budget. The primary operating costs of
the Housing/CDBG Program are personnel-related, for administration and program delivery. The
Program is supported by seven staff.
Major tasks for the Division in FY 2014/15 include: issuing loan commitments and managing new
housing projects conditionally awarded funding in June 2014; recruiting and screening prospective
home buyers for a large number of below market rate homes to be completed next year in new
housing developments; overseeing the development of two affordable housing developments at
the Armory site; overseeing completion of the home buyer project on Jackson Street by Habitat
for Humanity; and collaborating with the County and other jurisdictions and service providers to
develop alternative programs to house homeless people after closure of the winter shelter at the
Armory. Staff is also overseeing the completion of a nexus study on the Housing Mitigation Fee.
Along with a previously completed nexus study regarding rental housing, staff will be developing
a proposal for City Council consideration of a possible rental housing impact fee and possible
revisions to the Housing Mitigation Fee. The Housing Division is also leading the effort to prepare
the Housing Element Update, which must be adopted and submitted to the state by January 2015.
Other ongoing work items include preparing the 2015-2020 HUD Consolidated Plan and the
2015 Action Plan and implementing fair housing, language access, and related housing outreach
activities.

*The decrease in number of plan checks is due to the revision
of the way products are counted. Beginning in FY 2012/13,
the number of products was recorded as actual projects
rather thant the previously recorded number of units per
project. For example, a project with 100 residential untis is
now counted as one project (previously counted as 100 units)
as the building permits for multiple units are typically
reviewed concurrently. Similarly, a large office project is
counted as one unit or project, whereas the review may be
more complex. The revision more accurately measures the
actual staff review requirement for bulding plans.

Water Resources
The Department’s Water and Sewer Division is responsible for supplying water to City residents.
The City purchases and distributes water from two main suppliers – the Santa Clara Valley Water
District and the San Francisco Public Utility Commission. These sources are supplemented by
water pumped from groundwater aquifers (wells) and by recycled water from the Sunnyvale
Water Pollution Control Plant. The Department provides potable water to residents through a
network of distribution pipes, service laterals, including individual meters, and pressure and flow
regulating valves and controls. Recycled water is provided through a separate network of pipes,
valves, hydrants, and controls, all distinguishable by their purple color coding. The Department is
responsible for constructing, maintaining, and improving this infrastructure in order to optimize
service to City residents. The Department is also responsible for ensuring that the City’s water
system is compliant with all applicable regulatory requirements.

Storm Water Collection System
The Department maintains and operates the City’s storm drainage collection system, which is
comprised of approximately 300 miles of pipe, 4,200 drain inlets, two high volume pump stations,
and associated appurtenances. The Water and Sewer Division is responsible for this system. Field
crews provide emergency response to localized flooding, as well as general system maintenance.
Overall collection and management of storm water for the City is regulated under the terms of a
Bay Area-wide National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), Municipal Separate
Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit. The Department ensures the City is in compliance with
NPDES regulations.

Sanitary Sewer Collection System
The Department’s Water and Sewer Division maintains and operates the City’s sanitary sewer
collection system, which is comprised of 283 miles of pipe, 29,500 lateral connections, five
lift stations, and associated appurtenances. Field crews provide emergency response to system
overflows as well as general system maintenance. The sewer system and treatment plant operate
under an NPDES Permit, and the collection system is regulated under State Water Resources
Control Board Order 2006-0003-DWQ, Statewide General Waste Discharge Requirements. The
Department is responsible for maintaining compliance with all applicable regulations.

Wastewater Management
The Water Pollution Control Plant Division provides for the treatment of wastewater in the City.
This includes providing for treatment and discharge of wastewater from within the City and from
the Rancho Rinconada residential development within the city limits of Cupertino. An additional
service is the production of recycled water for use by residents, businesses, and institutions in the
northern part of Sunnyvale, primarily for landscape irrigation. Also a key component is generation
of electrical energy from biogenic gas (methane) produced in the closed landfill and in the treatment
plant digesters. The Regulatory Programs Division is responsible for management of urban runoff
(storm water), including implementation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit for urban runoff (storm water), as well as the laboratory and the industrial waste
inspectors.

Solid Waste Management
The Solid Waste Programs Division provides for collection of garbage from residents, businesses,
and institutions, as well as recyclables from single- and multi-family residences, City facilities,
schools and businesses, and yard trimmings from single-family residences. A key focus of the
Division is waste reduction, which it affects by offering recycling and waste reduction information,
outreach and services, and household hazardous waste collection events. The Division also is
responsible for environmental quality monitoring, management, and regulatory compliance
activities at the closed Sunnyvale Landfill.

SMaRT Station®
The Department operates the Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer Station (SMaRT
Station) under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) among the cities of Mountain View, Palo
Alto, and Sunnyvale. The SMaRT Station MOU is coordinated with each city’s landfill disposal
agreement with Waste Management, Inc. Key services provided by the SMaRT Station include
receipt of garbage from the three cities, diversion of recyclable materials by the materials recovery
facility (MRF), and transfer of the unrecycled portion to Kirby Canyon Landfill in San Jose. The
Station processes and markets recyclables from Mountain View and Sunnyvale. (Palo Alto has its
recyclables processed elsewhere.) The Station also receives, processes, and markets compostable
yard trimmings. In addition, it operates a drop-off / buyback recycling center for the public, and
accepts “universal waste” including household batteries, used automotive fluids and batteries,
electronic waste, fluorescent bulbs and tubes, and medical “sharps”. It also holds document
shredding events.

Environmental Services Department
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
FY 2014/15 is the first year of the two-year operating budget cycle. Overall, the department made
significant increases to its proposed budget. Increases to costs that are under the City’s control
primarily impacted the Wastewater Management Programs and include the addition of two new
positions stemming from the renovation of the Water Pollution Control Plant and increases in
materials, like chemicals. The primary driver of cost increases to the department that are not under
the City’s control is the cost of purchased water. Also, increased regulations regarding wastewater
discharge are driving up operating costs at the WPCP. And, tightening regulations regarding litter
have impacted both the wastewater and solid waste utilities, and implementing the Council’s Zero
Waste policy has begun to impact the budget for the department. Overall, the department budget is
up 8% from the prior budget. Significant changes from the FY 2013/14 budget are outlined below.

Water Resources
The Water Resources Program budget is being driven up primarily by the cost of purchasing water,
which is projected to be up $3.4 million. The program is also faced with adapting to evolving state
requirements for maintaining, monitoring, sampling, and reporting water quality. These changes
reflect maintenance and operation guidelines from the American Water Works Association.
The requirements will continue to increase fire hydrant flushing and maintenance, water valve
exercising, and water blow-off flushing. Additional monitoring of all discharges, planned and
unplanned, are also required by regulatory mandate.
The current drought conditions being experienced throughout California will have an impact on
revenues and costs. Decreased water usage during the drought will result in lower than projected
revenues. Operating costs, such as the price of water, energy, water quality regulations, and the
implementation of conservation programs, will continue rising in the near term as well, and are
incorporated into this two-year budget, as well as the Water Supply and Distribution Fund TwentyYear Financial Plan.

Wastewater Collections
Beginning with this budget cycle, the Sewer and Storm Collections Programs are being reorganized
into one Wastewater Collections Program. The programs have, for many years, utilized the same
staff, but were budgeted separately. The combination of the programs will streamline the budget
for the Water & Sewer Division and more clearly reflect the entire cost of operating the City’s
sewer and storm collections systems.

448

Environmental Services Department
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Solid Waste Management
Solid Waste Management costs are up for a variety of reasons. Landfill post-closure maintenance
costs and the complexity of work continue to increase due to more stringent regulatory scrutiny of
landfill gas and other regulatory issues. This scrutiny comes from multiple levels of government
and manifests itself in the form of requirements for calculating and reporting landfill gas generation
rates and emissions of greenhouse gases. The requirements come from USEPA, CalRecycle and
the County Environmental Health Department (the state’s “Local Enforcement Agency), the Bay
Area Air Quality Management District and the AB 32 landfill monitoring/reporting requirements of
the California Air Resources Board. Significant cost increases related to controls on discharges of
stormwater associated with industrial activity at the landfill will likely occur upon implementation
of the new industrial storm water permit, as currently proposed by the State Water Resources
Control Board. Additionally, costs for collection of solid waste continue to rise, and the City’s
efforts to implement a Zero Waste program have begun to increase costs.

SMaRT Station
SMaRT Station expenses and revenues have been updated to reflect current tonnage and recycled
materials value projections. Total tons received (all materials) are projected to be 245,370. The
budget assumes that materials recovery facility (MRF) operations by the contract operator will
achieve a municipal solid waste (MSW) diversion percentage of 22%. This is reflected in the
operating budget on both the expenditure and revenue sides. The budget projects a consumer price
index (CPI)-based increase of 2.3% in the annual payment to the contract operator, Bay Counties
Waste Services, based on the provisions of the current operations contract. An RFP is underway to
select the operator for the next contract term, 2015-2021. Any changes to costs or revenues arising
from the RFP process will be reflected in future budgets.
The SMaRT Station budget includes landfill disposal charges paid to Waste Management, Inc.,
under the provisions of the three city disposal contracts. Because of the Second Amendment to
the disposal contracts, which became effective in December 2013, the budget projects no future
minimum disposal quantity “put or pay” payments owed to Waste Management, Inc. This is
because the Second Amendment greatly reduced the minimum quantity requirements in exchange
for an increase in the per-ton charge for disposal. At current and projected disposal levels, the net
result will be an overall reduction in City disposal costs. The projected per-ton landfill disposal
fee assumes a 2.3% increase in the CPI effective July 1, 2014. No increases are assumed for
government taxes and fees charged at Kirby Canyon Landfill.

449

Environmental Services Department
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Compliance with the new storm water permit requirements proposed by the State Water Resources
Control Board is likely to have significant cost implications. There are likely to be both new onetime costs for designing and constructing structural changes needed to allow compliance and, to a
lesser extent, increases in ongoing costs for managing, monitoring, sampling and analysis of storm
water runoff. These issues and associated costs are currently being studied and appropriate funding
will be incorporated into the budget when more information is available.

Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP)
The purpose of the WPCP is to treat wastewater suitable for discharge to the southernmost end of
the Bay. The WPCP is a vital element of the utility infrastructure of the City. Large sections of
the WPCP are older than 40 years and each year additional challenges present themselves as the
WPCP continues to age, equipment breaks, and the facility degrades. The aging plant needs to be
rebuilt over the next 10 to 15 years at a cost exceeding $300 million. In addition, “gap” projects
need to be completed to keep the Plant operating until it is rebuilt. The City is now well on its way
to rebuilding the Plant with a Consultant who has been working over the last year developing the
master plan for rebuilding the Plant as well as to design the new headworks and primary facilities,
which are beyond their useful life and highly vulnerable to failure. At key milestones, staff will
be bringing items to Council as the decisions related to the WPCP renovation and rebuild are
addressed.
The southernmost end of the Bay where the treated wastewater is discharged is shallow and
is considered a fragile habitat. Treatment plants in this area are subject to strict regulatory
requirements. Staff are actively monitoring and participating in regulatory developments that may
impact the WPCP’s operations. In addition to these stringent regulatory compliance challenges,
Sunnyvale uses an unusual method for biological treatment of wastewater employing algae growth
in ponds to supply oxygen to the secondary treatment microorganisms. Over the years, solids
accumulate in the ponds and ultimately need to be removed. The City has secured the services of
Synagro to dredge and dewater the pond solids and remove them for reuse. This project began
operations in FY 2011/12. Concerns about the impacts of dredging on the treatment process are
being addressed.
To address the ongoing operational challenges related to regulatory compliance and aging facilities,
the WPCP budget includes increases in the categories of power and chemical budgets to operate
the facility and maintenance budgets associated with unanticipated and unscheduled repairs.
Further, to support the ongoing construction projects, two additional staffing positions are being
created in the WPCP projects budget. These staff will be dedicated to design review, construction
coordination, ensuring uninterrupted operations during construction, review, development and
integration of the control systems and overall safety coordination of the construction program with
the ongoing WPCP operations.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Regulatory Programs
Regulatory Program services include laboratory support for water and wastewater operations,
outreach and inspection services for wastewater and stormwater quality protection, and oversight
of the array of activities and reports for wastewater management. These include those for air
quality, safety, and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for the
Water Pollution Control Plant and for Stormwater.
NPDES permits require public outreach and education to achieve pollution prevention and
reduction goals. Requirements include reaching specific audiences (e.g. adults, school children,
general businesses, and specific businesses such as dentists, mobile cleaners, etc.) as well as
providing messages regarding specific pollutants (e.g. mercury, trash, copper). The Regulatory
Programs Division oversees these efforts.
Water quality regulations are in flux and are expected to require enhanced program activities. Both
NPDES permits are set to expire in 2014 and will undergo renegotiation and renewal in 2014/15.
The Stormwater Permit is a regional permit, held by each of the Bay Area cities and special districts
that discharge stormwater to San Francisco Bay. The next permit is expected to require expanded
implementation of elements that were in planning or pilot stages in the current permit. These
include stringent requirements for the reduction of litter to creeks, measures to reduce sediment
mobility to prevent the discharge of mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and treatment
measures to address roadway pollution (called “Green Streets”). Limited additional funding is
proposed to begin implementation of expanded trash reduction programs. Additionally, nutrients
have emerged as a priority issue for San Francisco Bay due to concerns that the Bay may be losing
its resiliency to high nutrient loads and may begin to experience significant impacts. Wastewater
treatment plants are the primary source of elevated nutrient loads to the Bay; limited additional
funding is proposed to address the requirements of the impending Nutrients Watershed Permit,
which will require all Plants to conduct facility studies and contribute to scientific studies related
to nutrients.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The Department of Finance is responsible for the overall financial management of the City.
The Department’s core function is to maintain a strong, secure financial position for the City by
providing a wide variety of financial and analytical services to staff, Council, and the public.

Programs and Services
The Department of Finance is organized into six programs: Accounting and Financial Services;
Financial Management and Analysis; Budget Management; Purchasing; Treasury Services; and
Utility Billing, Collection, and Revenue Management.

Accounting and Financial Services
The Accounting and Financial Services Program provides accounting and financial reporting
services to City management and staff, City Council, Sunnyvale residents and businesses, and
regulatory agencies to enable them to make informed decisions about the financial affairs of the
City. The Program also provides payroll and accounts payable services to support City operations.
In order to accurately record the City’s financial transactions, Program staff maintains the City’s
financial software, including daily account balancing and structural and security set-up. Other
activities include providing financial system reports on a regular basis to City staff, along with
query tools for use on an ad-hoc basis. Accounting for the City’s fiscal transactions is done in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for governmental entities. Staff
manages the independent financial audit of the City as required by City Charter, and produces the
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and other required annual financial statements.
In addition, staff in the Program prepares twelve other annual regulatory reports. Routine monthly
activities include reconciling all bank and general ledger accounts, as well as monitoring and
requesting reimbursement for approximately 300 grants and capital projects on a timely basis to
ensure that the City maintains optimum cash flow.
The Accounting and Financial Services Program also includes activities associated with managing
and preparing the payroll and payment for all goods and services required to support the City’s
operations. Staff processes payments to about 1,100 employees on a bi-weekly basis. This
function includes issuing approximately 28,000 checks or direct deposits annually, completing all
regulatory reports to state and federal agencies and the California Public Employees Retirement
System, and managing and maintaining the City’s computerized payroll system. The Accounts
Payable function includes paying supplier invoices on time, accurately, and in compliance with
contract terms and conditions and City policies. Staff also is responsible for all regulatory reports
related to vendor payments.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Financial Management and Analysis
The Financial Management and Analysis Program provides financial expertise to City departments,
helping them maintain a strong, secure financial position for the City through the fiscal stewardship
of City resources. Activities include maintaining and enhancing Citywide internal control, and
providing fiscal impact analysis of internal and external actions affecting the City. The Director of
Finance serves as Chief Financial Officer of the City and Treasurer of the Sunnyvale Redevelopment
Successor Agency. The Program also provides overall supervision to department staff and ensures
administrative support needs are met.
Also included in the Program are the fiduciary audit function, as well as administration and
monitoring of the financial aspects of the Sunnyvale Redevelopment Successor Agency. Fiduciary
audits are performed, based on a risk matrix, on City financial transactions to ensure security, cost
effectiveness, and compliance with policies, regulations, and laws. Program staff also oversees
administration of the former Redevelopment Agency’s dissolution in compliance with state
legislation. Finance functions for the Successor Agency include preparing all required reports,
monitoring and enforcing existing development agreements, paying off existing debt obligations,
and disposing of the former Agency’s properties and assets.

Budget Management
Budget Management Program staff develops, delivers, and continually monitors the operating
and capital budgets, and 20-year long-term financial plans, for nearly 50 City funds and subfunds. Budgetary analysis is also provided through the Program. Activities include development
of revenue projections, preparation of the annual fee schedule, review and analysis of operating
programs and projects, identifying the budgetary impacts of various City issues, and monitoring
revenues and expenditures on a continual basis. The Program also is responsible for completing
specific operational audits as directed by the City Manager and the Director of Finance.

Purchasing
The Purchasing Program provides centralized purchasing for all goods and services to support City
operations, including public works construction contracting, in accordance with the City Charter
and the Sunnyvale Municipal Code. Centralized procurement assures fair and open acquisition
processes that seek to obtain maximum value for each dollar spent. Major activities include
soliciting formal competitive bids and proposals, obtaining informal quotes, and participating in
cooperative procurements with other governmental agencies where appropriate. In addition, staff
provides assistance and training to City employees to ensure that they understand and comply with
all legal and ethical requirements.
Purchasing Program staff also maintains a centralized warehouse so that employees may obtain
commonly used supplies conveniently and at a reduced cost due to volume discounts. Central

514

Finance

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Stores staff disposes of surplus and obsolete equipment, and provides centralized receiving for the
City’s Corporation Yard.

Treasury Services
Treasury Services staff provides cash management, investment, and treasury services so that
the City’s money is managed safely and prudently. Program staff invests the City’s pooled cash
portfolio of approximately $280 million in accordance with the City’s Investment Policy, which
is reviewed and approved by Council annually. Activities include ensuring that debt service
payments are made for all outstanding bond issues and continuing disclosure reports are filed as
required by bond covenants.
Program staff also reviews and processes revenues for all departments and administers the local
Business License Tax, Utility Users Tax, and Transient Occupancy Tax ordinances. Staff bills
and receives payments centrally for all accounts receivable owed to the City. In addition, staff
manages collections of delinquent accounts receivable. Treasury functions also include providing
central cashiering services and maintaining the City’s banking relationships.
The Treasury Program staff reviews and audits all disbursements made through accounts payable,
payroll, and purchasing cards to ensure compliance with City policies. The Program is also
responsible for properly accounting for approximately 12,400 revenue transactions handled by
City staff.

Utility Billing, Collection, and Revenue Management
The Utility Billing, Collection, and Revenue Management Program provides utility billing and
customer services to customers of the City’s water, wastewater, and solid waste utilities. Program
staff also provides financial management support to enable the provision of high-quality utility
services at the lowest possible rates. All costs of the Program are reimbursed by the three utilities
through a payment to the General Fund.
Activities in the Program include reading of water meters, operating the utility customer service
center, issuing utility bills and collecting revenues, and maintaining the automated utility billing
system. Residential meters are read every other month, and commercial meters are read once
a month, with customers billed accordingly. The utility customer service center works with
customers to start and stop utility services as needed, processes one-time orders for service, helps
with emergencies such as sewer backups and water pipe breaks, and handles service complaints.
Payments from customers are processed daily and delinquent bills are ultimately collected through
the interruption of service.
Staff in the Program also provides financial management services to the utility operating programs.
Activities in this area include developing and setting annual utility rates and taking them to Council

515

for approval. Staff prepares and reviews operating and capital budgets and long-term financial
plans for each utility, and provides financial and operational consulting services to utility program
managers.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
FY 2014/15 is the first year of a two-year operating budget cycle. In virtually every program,
demand for the Department of Finance’s core services is increasing. In response, the Department
is focusing on leveraging resources and using streamlined work processes to handle the increase in
workload. This leveraging involves cross training as needed for maximum flexibility, identifying
ways that technology can be used to make processes more efficient, and focusing on best practices.
Through these efforts, the Department has been able to hold the budget largely flat for FY 2014/15
and FY 2015/16 after accounting for increases in compensation costs and a temporary position
hold in the Budget Management Program for FY 2013/14.
Staff has also begun the scoping process for the implementation of a new Citywide financial
system, which is the underlying system for all of the City’s financial transactions. A project is
underway to do a full needs assessment of the Department’s operations, identify potential system
solutions, and eventually procure a new financial system. This project will impact every division
within the Department and take three to five years to implement.
The Department also maximizes all revenue resources to which the City is entitled. The
maximization is accomplished through audits, improving processes, educating staff Citywide, and
focusing on full cost recovery for user fees. Below are the highlights of the Department budget
by program.

Accounting and Financial Services
The Accounting and Financial Services Program consists of three functions — payroll, accounts
payable, and accounting and financial reporting. In the payroll and accounts payable areas the
major emphasis is to improve processes through the thoughtful application of technology, enhanced
analysis, and value-added services. A specific effort is being made to deploy additional modules
of our automated payroll system, which will primarily involve the distributed input of time cards
and streamlined workflow. The anticipated results will be greater efficiency, less double entry,
and fewer errors. The Program also placed a Payroll Technician at the City’s Corporation Yard to
better serve the City’s field based divisions. Staff also is working on process improvements in the
accounts payable unit to drive greater efficiencies and improve current processes.

Financial Management and Analysis
In addition to providing Chief Financial Officer services and department management, the Financial
Management and Analysis Program focuses on a number of revenue producing functions, including
tracking development mitigation fees and sales tax audits. In the same vein, the fiduciary audits
performed or managed by the Program have identified operational savings or eliminated future

517

Finance

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

liabilities. The Program also includes the financial and administrative functions associated with
the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency of the City of Sunnyvale.

Budget Management
The primary focus of the Budget Management Program is the development, delivery, and continual
monitoring of the adopted budget and 20-year long-term financial plan. The Program also includes
the performance auditing function. The emphasis of the program will be to continue to provide core
services, most notably the development and delivery of the recommended and adopted budgets,
while integrating the performance audit function with the budget development process to ensure
audit priorities are aligned with the budget. The FY 2014/15 Budget is higher than the FY 2013/14
Budget because a vacancy in the performance auditing function was held and recognized for one
year. The program is fully funded again in FY 2014/15.

Purchasing
Over the past several years, the Purchasing Program has stepped up its emphasis on competitive
bidding and will continue this trend in the foreseeable future, especially as the City addresses its
aging infrastructure. Several complex, large procurements have begun, including those associated
with reconstruction of the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). These projects will require
significant resources inside and outside of the Program.
In order to meet the City’s purchasing demands, the Purchasing Program will necessarily focus
on implementing value-added activities such as electronic purchasing/payment automation and
obtaining value pricing for commodities through increased use of consolidated master purchase
agreements, as well as improving Central Stores inventory management. An additional area
of focus is staff training due to the many new employees at all levels of the organization who
are being hired to replace retiring City workers. Sunnyvale’s centralized purchasing system is
complex, requiring regular training to help ensure all procurement policies and processes are being
followed.

Treasury Services
The main focus of the Treasury Services Program has been ensuring that all revenues owed to
the City are collected, particularly in the accounts receivable and business licensing functions.
Accounts receivable consists of one staff member who issues approximately 6,400 bills and
generates approximately $3 million in revenue annually. Treasury Services has improved its
receivables collection efforts in several ways, including placing unpaid administrative citations
for residential properties on the County of Santa Clara property tax roll. Administrative citations
are issued by the City’s Neighborhood Preservation Division and billed by Finance. The collection
rate on this type of receivable has historically been low. Collecting this fine together with property
taxes has caused many owners to pay, doubling the revenue collected on administrative citations.

518

Finance

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Treasury Services also administers the City’s business license tax ordinance, which licenses
approximately 11,400 businesses. Business licensing consists of two staff members; one person
maintains the business license database and the other staff member specializes in audits. Staff
continued a series of audits to ensure businesses operating in Sunnyvale have a current business
license. Since the inception of the audit program in August 2009, almost $1.2 million has been
collected through February 2014.

Utility Billing, Collection, and Revenue Management
Over the past several years, the Utility Billing Program has experienced an increase in call volume,
primarily related to the implementation of the ChoiceCollect garbage and recyclables collection
system. Following the implementation of ChoiceCollect, the Program again expanded its scope
and now takes almost all utility-related customer service calls, including garbage complaints, water
and sewer emergency calls, water quality calls, and other service-related calls. Most recently, the
Program took over the administration of water backflow prevention device certifications from
the Environmental Services Department. This, combined with a general increase in activity, has
resulted in a permanent adjustment to the base call volume work load handled by the Program.
In order to address these and other pressures on the Program’s work load, staff has been focused
on implementing technology and streamlining work processes. Customer use of web based bill
presentment and payment continues to grow. Currently, approximately 47% of the City’s customers
have enrolled in on-line billing or set up automatic ACH payments. Many of those customers opted
not to receive paper statements, reducing our printing and postage costs. However, a downside
is a significant increase in credit card fees. Another use of technology is processing paper checks

519

Finance

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

electronically using specialized remittance processing equipment. Additionally, the Program
continues to work with the Department of Environmental Services to deploy automated meter
reading technology. To date, approximately 48% of all water meters are now retrofitted with radio
read technology, including most of the City’s commercial meters. The Program has also initiated
a pilot for cellular based smart meters, which will allow residents to monitor their water use in
real time, as well as enable the City to read the meters for billing remotely. The result of these
efforts has been additional capacity to do some basic meter maintenance tasks, such as vegetation
removal and radio read equipment replacement, using existing staff.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The Human Resources Department coordinates services and programs which assist City departments
in developing and maintaining a qualified, effective, and diverse workforce of approximately 870
regular full- and part-time employees, and as many as 500 temporary employees. The Department
also provides employment-related services to City employees, job applicants, and City volunteers.

Programs and Services
The Human Resources Department is organized into five service areas: Risk Management,
Recruitment/Classification, Employee Relations/Employee Development, Employee Benefits, and
Management and Administrative Support Services.

Risk Management
The Risk Management Division administers the City’s liability, safety and workers’ compensation
activities. The Liability Program processes claims filed against the City and coordinates the
City’s participation in the California Joint Powers Risk Management Authority, which provides
excess liability, property, and auto insurance coverage to member agencies. This service area is
responsible for managing all workers’ compensation claims and compliance with legal mandates.
Its Safety/Loss Control activities include safety training, policy development, work site inspection,
and accident prevention. Risk Management also manages the City’s leaves programs, including
the City’s paid medical leave program and the disability reasonable accommodation process in
accordance with City policy, applicable Memoranda of Understanding, and all relevant state and
federal laws, including the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the California Family
Rights Act (CFRA), the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

Recruitment/Classification
The Recruitment and Classification service area is responsible for managing and administering
the City’s recruitment, examination, selection, and pre-employment activities for both regular and
temporary positions. This includes managing the City’s temporary agency contracts. Staff also
manages and administers the City’s classification program, which involves preparing, reviewing,
and updating job specifications, as well as conducting classification studies and organizational
analyses.

Employee Relations/Employee Development
The Employee Relations service area manages employee and labor relations activities for the six
recognized employee bargaining units and the two unrepresented employee groups in accordance

561

Human Resources

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

with the Meyers-Milias Brown Act. Staff also manages the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU)
with each of the recognized units. Staff in this service area administers and assists departments
with employee relations issues, grievances, employee performance, and discipline issues.
Responsibilities also include the Citywide Employee Performance Evaluation Program, the City’s
Employee Development Program, which includes the Employee Training Program and Career
Development Program, and the City Volunteer Resources Program.

Employee Benefits
The Employee Benefits service area manages and administers all of the City’s employee insurance
and benefits programs including the retirement and supplemental retirement plans, IRS §125 plan,
medical, dental, vision, life and long-term disability insurance plans, and employee assistance
programs. Staff also manages the Human Resources Information System (HRIS), including the
processing and inputting of all employee payroll and benefits information.

Management and Administrative Support Services
The Management and Administrative Support Services Division provides overall management
and administrative support to the Department, including budget administration, answer point
management, and purchasing and maintaining office supplies. Staff also coordinates several
Citywide activities such as the Combined Giving Campaign, Annual Employee Appreciation
Breakfast, and the Years of Service Recognition Event.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
The Human Resources Department’s two-year operating budget does not reflect significant changes
for FY 2014/15.
In FY 2010/11, the Human Resources Department eliminated three positions primarily due to
the overall reduction in City hiring. With the steady increase in City turnover rate since 2008 and
added City budgeted positions in the last couple of fiscal years, City recruitment activities have
increased. The following chart displays a steady increase in the turnover rate since 2008.
With the recent industry changes in legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act and the Public
Employee Pension Reform Act, the demand on staff time and resources on implementing changes,
ensuring compliance, and continuous administration monitoring have continued to increase.
Further, four of the six employee associations will have an expiring Memorandum of Understanding
in FY 2014/15. This will requires significant staff time and preparation in negotiation activities. As
such, the legal and professional services budgets have been increased to accommodate the increase
in labor negotiation activities.

Risk Management
The following table shows the trends in workers’ compensation claims since FY 2004/05. The
number of claims has been increasing, with a significant increase anticipated in FY 2013/14,
based on year-to-date numbers. Although the number of claims has been increasing, the overall
cost of workers’ compensation claims has been decreasing over the last several years. Medical
management programs such as nurse case management, utilization review and bill review help
control workers’ compensation costs. Also, the City’s return to work program gets employees back
in the workplace as soon as possible, which results in savings. With 68 percent of claims occurring
in the Department of Public Safety, the Risk Management Division will work closely with the DPS
to try to reduce both the frequency and the severity of workplace injuries.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Recruitment/Classification
Recruitment activity has increased over the past few fiscal years due to the economic recovery,
which had added positions back into the City budget, and employee retirements and employee
separations. At the current rate of total recruitment, FY 2013/14 will reach approximately 100 new
hires and promotions.
The Department of Public Safety began ongoing Public Safety Officer-in-Training and Public
Safety Officer I Lateral recruitments in mid-2012. These recruitments are to fill vacancies from
retirements, promotions, increased budgeted positions, and a few years of no hiring activity. From
July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2012, twenty Public Safety employees retired. In the 21 months starting
July 1, 2012, another fifteen Public Safety employees retired with three additional retirements
scheduled before the end of the FY 2013/14.

job descriptions. In FY 2014/15 the Division will work with the Employee Relations Division
to review the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) designations for the City’s job descriptions. This
project will be completed by the end of FY 2014/15.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The Information Technology Department (ITD) provides and maintains an array of modern
business systems, office automation, and communications technologies to support the City’s
business operations and the delivery of public services. Like any other City, the technology
environment in Sunnyvale is challenging due to the complex and varied business needs of the
diverse organizational units.
The City relies on well-managed, centralized IT services to control redundancy and balance
organizational technology priorities. This key attribute is essential to managing the City’s limited
technology budget while maintaining the City’s standard of delivering excellent public services
and simultaneously controlling costs and improving public access to services and public records.
In support of these goals, ITD employs a continuous improvement strategy to contain and reduce,
where possible, costs. ITD delivers technology services via well-trained and skilled professionals.
And ITD seeks to implement and support technologies that meet the City’s business requirements
and standards.

Programs and Services
The IT Department is realigning its budget structure in FY 2014/15 to better represent the services
delivered. Previously, the department was divided into programs that corresponded with the
department’s three divisions and their functions. However, ITD’s various services are almost
always collaborations of two, or all three, divisions. Under a new, single program for FY 2014/15,
activities are grouped and delineated by type of service delivered, rather than by which division
provided the service. This provides a more comprehensive view of the services and support ITD
provides.

IT Services and Support
IT Services and Support is defined as the activities required for providing ongoing IT support.
These activities consist of a wide variety of tasks, and account for approximately 80% of technical
staff time. Work is broken down in two basic activities: Resolving Requests for Service, and
System Maintenance Tasks. Resolving requests for service includes all work committed to address
requests from the line departments for anything from troubleshooting to adding new minor services,
such as new user accounts, to replacing or installing minor new equipment, such as new phones
or personal computers. System Maintenance Tasks include all tasks required to maintain existing
systems, such as installing software patches, installing minor releases, replacing aging hardware,

performing data backups, etc. Requests for new services that are beyond minor or routine requests
are considered IT Projects.
The table below shows the total number or service requests received by ITD since FY 2007/08.

IT Projects
IT Projects are defined as those tasks executed in support of the delivery of major IT systems
or services. This category includes projects to install entirely new systems or to perform major
upgrades to existing systems. One of the most significant upcoming projects is replacement of the
City’s financial applications with a new, well-integrated system. The current financial “system”
consists of several applications, many requiring specific, stand-alone hardware. Scoping will
begin in FY 2014/15, with implementation expected to take between three to five years. Some of
the other major projects planned for FY 2014/15 are:
•	 Replacement of the primary data switches to support fiber optic connections between
remote City facilities;
•	 Replacement of the largest data storage system currently in use;
•	 Replacement of the aging phone system;

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

IT Services and Support Management
IT Services and Support Management will capture all management tasks completed in support of
IT Operations and IT Projects, as well as all technical training and other technology related staff
development activities. In addition to IT Operations and Projects, in FY 2014/15, IT Managers will
focus on creating and implementing a comprehensive Business Continuity plan and addressing the
broader use of mobile computing devices.

IT Department Administration
The IT Department is distinguishing between the services and support directly related to IT
Operations and Projects and general department administration. Budget development and
tracking, procurement management, asset management, personnel management, and strategic and
tactical planning are all activities that fall under IT Department Administration. Non-technical
staff development and training is also included. In addition, the IT Department is the City’s liaison
for Telecommunications Franchises and Wireless Communications Facility Leases, and related
work is captured here. This includes oversight of cable television franchises, including resolving
customer complaints, and management of the rental of various City properties to wireless service
providers for cellular phone towers or other communications facilities.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
ITD is proposing the addition of one regular, full-time employee in FY 2014/15, as well as budgeting
for the upgrade of one existing position. These changes will better position the department to
manage its workload and provide cross coverage of critical systems.
City staffing reductions during the recent budgetary downturn impacted the IT Infrastructure
division, and staffing levels in the past few years have been well below industry standards. The
most significant impact of that staffing challenge has been the inability of the division to replace
equipment as planned; thereby increasing the risk of equipment failure thorough overlong retention
of old equipment and depriving line staff of planned functionality improvements. Staff added in
FY 2013/14 to address this challenge are already improving direct support by reducing the time
required for ITD to implement fixes and perform other basic functions.
In the Business Systems division there remains a large, unmet need for the creation and ongoing
maintenance of management reports. The addition of a new, junior-level Programmer Analyst is
proposed in this budget to meet some of these needs. The additional programmer will also add
labor capacity to assist with the replacement of old equipment by completing activities such as
data conversion or migration, documentation, testing, reporting or other Business Systems tasks
as appropriate.

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The Department of Library and Community Services (LCS) merges library services with recreation,
youth and family services, and community resources. LCS provides a wide range of programs,
services, resources, and events to meet the personal interests, educational, health and wellness
as well as recreational pursuits of Sunnyvale residents of all ages. LCS is the largest single user
of volunteers City-wide. Volunteers contributed an estimated $559,280 worth of service to LCS
in FY 2012/13 (based on the Independent Sector’s most recent estimated value of a volunteer
hour in California of $24.75). Library volunteers logged 4,638 hours while Community Services
volunteers logged 17,981 hours. The Library Division offers equal access to a diversity of ideas,
information, knowledge, and entertainment through its collection, programs, and services. The
Library provides services from a central facility with expansive hours, a library lending machine
at the Columbia Neighborhood Center, and online 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The
Community Services Division offers an array of active, self-directed, and organized recreational
programming. Programs are offered in arts, sports, fitness, and aquatics for all ages and skill
levels. Community Services collaborates with local school districts and non-profit organizations
to facilitate recreational, educational, child-care, social services, and health-care services based at
the Columbia Neighborhood Center and the Sunnyvale Senior Center. Community Services also
works with neighborhood associations, oversees the City-wide special events permitting process,
produces the annual State of the City event and administers the community grant program.

Library Services for Adults, Library Services for Children and Teens, Acquire Library Materials
for the Public, Technology Services, Prepare Library Materials for the Public, and Management,
Supervisory, and Administrative Support Services.

601

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Borrower Services/Circulation
The Library enables customers to access and borrow library materials by checking items in/out,
renewing items, shelving returned items to their proper location, and processing reserved items
and materials requested from other libraries for customers. Staff encourages the timely return
of materials by notifying borrowers of overdue items, sending replacement bills for items long
overdue, and collecting fines/fees. Staff also keeps existing library customer accounts updated and
issues library cards to new borrowers. In addition, staff delivers materials to a resident’s home if
that person is unable to come to the Library due to physical disability.

Library Services for Adults
The Library enhances the use of library materials and information resources for adults by providing
one-on-one assistance locating and utilizing those resources as well as providing programming
in support of community interests and educational pursuits. Staff attends community events and
meetings to promote Library services for adults.

Library Services for Children and Teens
The Library enhances the use of library materials and information resources for children and teens
by providing one-on-one assistance locating and utilizing those resources as well as providing
programming in support of community interests and educational pursuits. Staff attends community
events and meetings to promote Library services for children and teens. Resources are leveraged
with those of the Community Services Division and local non-profit organizations to provide
family literacy programs at the Columbia Neighborhood Center.

Acquire Library Materials for the Public
The Library provides quality collections for children, teens, and adults by selecting and acquiring
new and relevant materials in a wide variety of formats in response to community interest and
demand. Staff evaluates the collection areas in terms of age, relevancy, and condition. Staff also
orders and receives materials, processes invoices, and monitors purchases.

Technology Services
The Library maintains technology to support service delivery. Inside the Library, computers,
photocopiers and other equipment provide access to information and services. Outside the Library,
services are delivered through the Library website/catalog. The catalog allows customers to search
for library materials, magazine and newspaper articles, and e-Books, as well as manage their own
account, renew materials, place items on hold, request materials from other libraries, pay fines, and
register for a new library card. Maintaining all systems and equipment in working order ensures
continuity of services.

602

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Prepare Library Materials for the Public
The Library prepares materials for easy access and use by cataloging new materials accurately
using national standards, updating the catalog to keep it current, physically processing new books,
media items, periodicals and newspapers, and extending the life of repairable materials through
basic repair and rebinding.

Management, Supervisory, and Administrative Support Services
The Library delivers cohesive and cost-effective operations of the Library facility, maintaining a
safe and welcoming environment for customers and staff. High-quality customer service is provided
through programs and services designed to meet community needs. Staff provides leadership and
manages employees to support the overall effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery. The
financial condition and results of Library programs are monitored and analyzed to ensure optimal
use of resources. Library policies and procedures are developed and implemented to ensure even
application. Long-range plans are developed in order to meet the needs of the community. Staff
explores options for grants in order to supplement services with non-City funding. The Library
partners with civic groups, the local business community, City departments, the Board of Library
Trustees, and others to effectively inform the community about the services and resources available
to them.

Programs and Services
The Community Services Division is organized into two programs: Arts and Recreation and Youth
and Family Services.
The Arts and Recreation Program includes the following nine service delivery plans: Preschool,
Middle, and High School After School and Summer Recreation Programs; Senior Recreation

603

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Classes, Activities and Services/Therapeutic Recreation; Youth and Adult Visual and Performing
Arts Programs; Aquatics Activities and Facilities; Sport Classes and Activities; Recreation
Facility Rentals and Use; Registration, Reception Services, Community Outreach/Promotions
and Special Events; Community Resources; and Management and Administrative Support. The
Youth and Family Services Program includes the following two service delivery plans: Columbia
Neighborhood Center and Youth, Family and Child Care Resources.

Arts and Recreation Program
The Arts and Recreation Program provides year-round arts, recreation, health and wellness, and
enrichment activities for preschool-aged children through senior adults. Community Services
staff schedules, operates, and rents out City-owned and leased recreation facilities, including four
swimming pools, the recreation building, theater, creative arts center, indoor sports center, senior
center, dance studio, 13 park buildings, 53 picnic areas, 44 athletic fields as well as the Ortega
Park Gazebo and the Grove Amphitheater at Baylands. The Teen Advisory Committee and Senior
Center Advisory Committee are staffed by the Division. The Program also manages the City’s
Art in Private Development and Art in Public Places programs. A fee waiver program for eligible
Sunnyvale residents 17 years of age and younger is available to provide a safety net for low-income
families enabling them to participate in classes and activities. The Arts and Recreation Program
also develops, maintains, and grows community partnerships and resources. The partnerships allow
the Division to achieve its goals of providing varied, unduplicated programs that are attractive to
the community, maximize the resources partners can offer to benefit existing or new clients, and
provide a high quality product for the customer.
Community building and civic engagement are the main areas of focus for the Community
Resources portion of this program. Services include point of contact to address ADA concerns
from the public, coordination of the City’s neighborhood association program, administration
of the special events permitting process, administration of two community grant programs (one
for event organizers and one for neighborhood groups), and coordination of two staff advisory
committees (Advisory Committee on Accessibility, and the Human Relations Cultural Diversity
Advisory Committee). Additionally, City-wide special events, such as the Mayor’s annual State of
the City event, are included in this area. Finally, Community Services staffs and coordinates both
the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Arts Commission.

Youth and Family Services Program
The Youth and Family Services Program is based out of the Columbia Neighborhood Center
(CNC). The City of Sunnyvale operates CNC in collaboration with the Sunnyvale School District,
non-profit organizations, and community businesses to provide a connected network of services
and programs in the areas of community education, mental health services, health care, recreation,
and youth and neighborhood safety. The philosophy behind this web of services is to provide the
support that children in the service area need to develop the life skills necessary to be successful in

604

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

school and beyond. CNC focuses on serving at-risk youth attending Bishop, Fairwood, Lakewood,
San Miguel, and Columbia schools, as well as families with limited access to basic services
residing in the Center’s service area. The MayView Community Health Clinic offers a satellite
facility in the CNC. The Center and its partners also promote a strong community through events
and activities for the neighborhood. The CNC Community Advisory Committee advises CNC staff
on community needs of the service area.
In addition, programs and services that support the City’s child care providers, families with young
children, Citywide youth and family issues, and the Child Care Staff Advisory Board, which acts
in an advisory capacity to City staff on early care and education topics, are also based at CNC.

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
The Department’s operating budget reflects an overall reduction in resources as compared to FY
2013/14 budget, with some resources reallocated between programs. After a prolonged period
of time with multiple vacancies due to retirements and promotions, the Department’s staffing
structure was modified to better align resources with needs, enabling the Library to restore full
services on Thursday evenings and to have the capacity within the Library to assign analyst work
relating to the branch library and other Library projects.

Library Program
Overall business continues to be strong at the Library. In FY 2012/13, the Library experienced the
highest circulation to date. Library patrons borrowed 2,748,170 items, a 1.6% increase from the
previous year. Children’s materials and eBooks were in high demand. Circulation of children’s
materials accounted for 1,249,492 items or 45.5% of total circulation, up from 43% the previous
year. eBook circulation increased 40.9% from the previous year to 41,663 items borrowed. A
record-high 2,222,601 items were shelved in FY 2012/13. A total of 743,311 people visited the
Library, an average of 5.1 times per resident. The Library offered 895 programs, the highest
number offered to date. Library program attendance increased by 16% from the previous year
to a record-high 47,479 participants. While usage of the Library continues to increase, staffing
levels, however, have declined 26% in the past 10 years and are now at record low levels, as seen
in the chart below. This presents a challenge to the Library to meet the needs of the community,
providing efficient and effective services with fewer staff.

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Toward the end of FY 2009/10, the Library converted the entire Library collection from barcode
to RFID technology and installed an automated materials handling system, six new self-check
machines, four automated materials handling returns, and a new security gate. Since that time,
checkout is faster as multiple items can be checked out at once. The option to pay fines by credit
card at the self-check machines has helped to boost overall revenues collected by 20% since their
introduction. At check-in, materials are instantly removed from a customer’s account, and the
customer has the option to print a receipt as proof of return. This provides for more consistency
and accuracy in both patron accounts and the Library catalog.
In FY 2012/13, approximately 95% of materials were returned using the automated materials
handling system, and approximately 95% of checkouts now occur at the self-check machines,
compared with 55% in FY 2008/09. These efficiencies have allowed staff to keep up with rising
circulation as well as continue to provide excellent customer service.
A cost-savings reduction of $81,000 to funding for library collections in FY 2009/10 has contributed
to the Library’s most significant service delivery shortfall. The percentage of the Library budget
in FY 2013/14 allocated to the acquisition of library materials was 7.9%. This rate is on the lower
end in Santa Clara County, with San Jose Library at 9.4%, Mountain View Library at 10.8%, Palo
Alto Library at 12%, and Santa Clara County Library at 15.7% (based upon the most current data
available in FY 2011/12 from the California State Library). The reduction of collection development
dollars combined with a lack of capacity to grow the collection has resulted in Sunnyvale providing
only 2.12 materials per capita, below the statewide median of 2.13 and the lowest in Santa Clara
County. San Jose Public Library provides 2.36 items per capita, Santa Clara 3.40 items per capita,
Santa Clara County 4.37 items per capita, Mountain View 4.39 items per capita, Palo Alto 4.66
items per capita, and Los Gatos 5.61 items per capita. Neighboring libraries have between 45%
and 154% more materials available per child than the 3.8 items available per child in Sunnyvale.
Beginning in FY 2012/13, the Library reallocated funding from an existing vacant position to allow
for a $60,000 increase in library materials acquisition. This temporary reallocation is anticipated to
continue in FY 2014/15. Additionally, the FY 2014/15 budget will permanently restore $20,000 to
collections. The combined $80,000 will result in 9% of the Library budget that will be allocated to
the acquisition of library materials. This will not only be a step towards restoring items per capita,
it will also help to acquire materials in the digital formats that residents of Sunnyvale increasingly
expect from their city library.
Reallocation of funding from an existing vacant position had also provided the staffing necessary
to reopen the Library with limited services on Thursday evenings from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. beginning
in FY 2012/13. Phone services, reference assistance, programs, and other services were limited
on Thursday evenings. The FY 2014/15 budget permanently restores full services on Thursday
evenings by utilizing savings from the elimination of a Part-Time Graphic Artist position to add
a Library Specialist III position. Approximately 544 patrons on average visited the Library on

607

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Thursday evenings in FY 2013/14. This was similar to visitor counts before the Library closed on
Thursday evenings in FY 2011/12.
Due to the high volume of visitors to the Library (more than 2,000 visitors per day on average),
Library furniture and carpet requires increased cleaning in order to maintain a welcoming
environment. Funds for chair cleaning will supplement funds budgeted in the Public Works budget
so that cleaning will occur twice a year instead of only once a year. Funds for furniture replacement
will allow staff to strategically address the 23% decline in reader seats over the past 9 years. Funds
for computer hardware have been budgeted for keyboard/mice replacement in order to maintain a
hygienic computing environment for PCs which receive heavy use.

Community Services Programs
The Arts and Recreation Program budget completed its second full year as a General Fund program
in FY 2013/14. Previously, it had been a part of the Community Recreation Fund.
The new, two-year operating budget includes expansion of pre-school programming, where an
additional site (Murphy Park) will begin operating by Fall 2014. The $19,000 budget increase over
the FY 2013/14 budget is offset by a projected $34,000 in additional revenue. Youth Sports will
increase a total of $18,000 when compared to FY 2012/13. Associated revenue will increase by
over $30,000 as compared to FY 2012/13 actuals. Most of this increase is associated with sports
classes offered by contractors. This activity reflects a guaranteed expenditure to revenue ratio since
the contracts are set up on a fixed percentage. The City collects 100% of revenue and pays the
contractor the agreed-upon percentage.
The new, two-year operating budget also includes ongoing funding of $16,000 for the Community
Events and Neighborhood Grants program. For the past few years, Council has allocated funding
on an annual basis through the Budget Supplement process for these Council-approved grants,
which are awarded on a competitive basis facilitated by the Council’s Community Events and
Neighborhood Grant Distribution Subcommittee. Administrative tasks associated with this program
are handled by Community Services Division staff. The Neighborhood Grant program funds
neighborhood events and projects, each focusing on one of four areas: improving communication
and participation within a neighborhood; building bridges between different cultural groups;
improving the physical condition of the neighborhood; or enhancing neighborhood pride and
identity. The Community Event grant program supports events taking place within Sunnyvale
which are free and open to the public and which have attendance of 500 people or more.
The Community Services Division programs continue to support a balanced array of facilities,
services and recreation and arts opportunities for all ages. On an ongoing basis, programs and
services are evaluated and retooled to best meet the needs of community, with staff taking the
opportunity to achieve efficiencies and create partnerships wherever possible. When designing
new programs and services, Community Services staff considers likely participants, trends in

608

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

participation, competing services and the expected market share for that specific group, allocation
of financial and time resources, as well as motivation for participation. Community Services
Division staff has identified a number of programming opportunities to explore and implement
with an emphasis on the environment, cultural awareness, health and wellness, technology, youth
sports, and the aging population. Programmatic offerings, and associated costs and revenues,
contract and expand based on market, interest, and needs.
City Council granted $40,000 in funding to the Community Services Division to increase the Care
Manager hours at the Senior Center through June 30, 2014. The funding has been used to recruit
a temporary, casual employee to work part-time as a skilled social service professional at the
Senior Center alongside the existing part-time Care Manager by providing support services such
as assessment, care planning, service arrangements, and client monitoring. Staff will be coming
back to City Council with options and alternatives for the long term, based on data over the past
two years with the supplemental funding.
There has been a continued focus on identification and implementation of strategies to reduce
dependence on the General Fund. Again the focus is on efficiencies, increased revenue generation,
and service level adjustments, as necessary. Wherever possible, activities are structured to cover
their costs, with programs for youth and seniors, in general, requiring the greatest amount of
support from the General Fund. The budget also sets aside resources for the Recreation Fee Waiver
Program, which assists qualifying low-income Sunnyvale youth with the payment of registration
fees. The following graph shows trends in Community Services revenues and participation.

Library and Community Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

The expansion at Columbia Neighborhood Center (CNC) was completed in Spring 2012, adding
an additional 3,000 square feet to the existing facility, doubling the number of offices for social
services and the community health clinic, and adding a fitness room to be used by both the Columbia
Middle School students and the community. The FY 2012/13 CNC program’s operating budget
was not increased in anticipation of the expansion because it was the intent of the City to establish
new and expanded partnerships. These new partnerships, in conjunction with the expansion of
CNC, allow for increased programming and services for the youth and families that reside in the
CNC service area. The FY 2014/15 budget does realize increased funding, however, for CNC to
account for additional maintenance costs associated with the expansion.

NOVA Workforce Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The NOVA Workforce Services Department (NOVA) provides workforce development services
for the residents and businesses of northern Santa Clara County. NOVA is funded entirely through
federal, state and local grants, with the primary resources coming from the Workforce Investment
Act (WIA). The Department is also known as the NOVA (North Valley) Job Training Consortium.
The City of Sunnyvale is the host and fiscal agent for this seven-city consortium covering the
northern end of Santa Clara County.

Programs and Services
Services provided by NOVA are divided according to customer groups as follows:

Job Seeker Services
NOVA provides employment and training services to economically disadvantaged, unemployed,
and laid-off individuals. Services to adults include the NOVA JobCenter, job search workshops,
career advising, resume assistance, training support, and other employment-related services.
NOVA applies for non-WIA grants in order to provide services to special populations, such as
veterans and individuals with disabilities.

Employer Services
Services provided to employers include pre-layoff services, layoff-aversion and outplacement
assistance, staffing and recruitment, employee training and retention, business development, and
linkages to resources providing a wide range of business assistance.

Youth Services
The youth program provides individualized assistance in exploring and developing educational
and career goals for young people ages 16-24. Additional in-depth career guidance services are
available to youth from low-income families. NOVA provides these services through a contract
with the Bill Wilson Center.

Enterprise Services
NOVA staff develops strategies and grant applications to address gaps in services to target
populations. NOVA also conducts and contracts for labor market research to provide career
guidance for staff and job seekers. Staff also supports the NOVA Workforce Board, which is
appointed by the City Council to oversee the delivery of services with federal funds.

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
NOVA’s budget is dependent on its grant funding – both allocated funding and funds awarded
through a competitive process. For this reason, the budget will fluctuate over time. A base budget
is approved each year and then modified as necessary to reflect additional funding received during
the year. NOVA’s budget is primarily for staffing, with other major items including contractual
services and training. The NOVA budget is organized into three funding sources: WIA Programs,
Categorical Programs, and Non-Categorical Programs.
WIA Programs
NOVA’s WIA funding is allocated based on a federal funding formula administered by the State of
California, and consists of funds for adult, youth, dislocated workers, and rapid response (funding
to assist companies and individuals affected by layoffs). WIA funding is allocated to the state from
the federal government. This funding is subject to the same uncertainty as other federal programs
due to the current federal budget challenges including ever changing priorities and the overall
deficit position.
Categorical Programs
NOVA seeks grant funding from a variety of federal, state and local sources to serve special
populations, such as individuals with disabilities and veterans, and to implement strategies
developed by the NOVA Workforce Board that fill specific service gaps and align with the NOVA
Strategic Plan.

650

NOVA Workforce Services
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Non-Categorical Programs
NOVA pursues foundation funding for capacity building, strategic planning, and other purposes
that do not address services to individual customers.
A portion of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) funding received by the state is categorized
as “Governor’s discretionary funds” or 25% Additional Assistance Funds, which are available to
fund specific projects called Additional Assistance Grants (AAG’s). NOVA has received funding
through this pool of funds since 1989 to provide services to dislocated workers. It is typical
for NOVA’s Budgeted Position Allocation (BPA) to reflect more positions than the Department
currently has funding to support. This allows NOVA to be flexible with its staffing and move
quickly when additional grant funding is secured. Since NOVA is entirely grant funded, reflecting
additional head count has no fiscal impact on the City, as NOVA only spends its allocated grant
funding.

Office of the City Attorney

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The Office of the City Attorney (OCA) provides legal advice and services to the City Council, City
officials, staff, departments, boards, commissions, and related City bodies; protects the interests
of the City; and ensures that actions by or on behalf of the City and its related bodies are in
accordance with applicable legal requirements. The OCA represents the City, its officers, and its
employees in administrative and civil litigation matters involving official City business. It also
prepares contracts, ordinances, resolutions, and other legal documents involving the City, and
prosecutes violations of the Municipal Code. Office staff consists of the City Attorney, a Senior
Assistant City Attorney, two Assistant City Attorneys, a paralegal and a legal secretary.

Programs and Services
The OCA has three main areas of responsibility – Provide Legal Advice, Provide Representation,
and Management and Administration.

Provide Legal Advice
The OCA advises and counsels the City Council, the Redevelopment Successor Agency, Boards,
Commissions, and City staff on legal issues in all City operations, including property development,
zoning, redevelopment, housing, public utilities, administrative, environmental, liability, and
general matters. The OCA prepares ordinances, resolutions, contracts, and franchises. The OCA
also monitors changes and developments in laws concerning the City, communicates pertinent
changes to the City Council and affected departments, and drafts amendments to City ordinances
and documents to comply with changes to the law.

Provide Representation
The OCA is responsible for representing the City in all legal actions and administrative proceedings
in which the City is concerned, or to which it is a party. The OCA represents City officials and
employees in civil litigation arising out of or connected to City employment, and also prosecutes
all charges of violation of municipal ordinances and regulations.

Management and Administrative Support Services
Management and administrative support staff for the OCA monitor overall office performance,
prepare and administer the office budget, and update and maintain the Department’s website. As
necessary, the OCA directs and monitors the work and costs of outside counsel. Personnel attend
programs and training consistent with State requirements for continuing legal education.

Office of the City Attorney

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
The FY 2014/15 budget for the Office of the City Attorney (OCA) was restructured to simplify and
clarify current services by reducing the number of activities listed in the core areas of responsibility
from twenty-two to seven. The essential program for the office remains the same – to deliver
top-notch in-house legal services to the City by providing high quality, high value advice and
representation to our constituent clients.
The largest change came in the form of reallocating legal costs. Costs formerly appearing in the
OCA budget for legal expenses associated with the City’s Successor Agency, Property and Liability
Insurance Program, Wastewater, SMaRT Station, and Solid Waste Programs will be accounted
for in the specific program budgets associated with those activities to increase transparency and
awareness of actual program costs. This budget change represents a reduction from the previous
year to the OCA budget. However the costs for legal expenses related to property and liability
were increased to reflect historically higher than budgeted spending.

Office of the City Manager
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Department Description
The Office of the City Manager (OCM) provides management and administrative services for
City departments and the City Council. The City Manager is the government equivalent of a Chief
Executive Officer (CEO), guiding department directors who administer services to the community
while adhering to the direction and policies set by the City Council.

Programs and Services
The Office of the City Manager is organized into six services: City Clerk’s Office, Public
Information, Economic Development/Business Attraction and Retention, City Council, Print/Mail
Services, and Management and Administrative Support Services.

City Council
This service area provides the resources and support needed by the City Council to establish City
policy and carry out legislative responsibilities. The Mayor and City Council are supported by
one administrative staff member. Other budgeted funds are allocated to such costs as Council
conference and travel expenses, and office equipment/supplies.

Management and Administrative Support Services
The Management and Administrative Support Services Program ensures the effective and efficient
management of the Office of the City Manager by exercising the powers and fulfilling the Citywide
duties of the City Manager, including general oversight of all City operations. Staff includes the
City Manager, Assistant City Manager, a Senior Management Analyst, an Executive Assistant, and
administrative support.

City Clerk’s Office
Routine responsibilities of the Office of the City Clerk include supporting City Council meetings,
overseeing the City’s Boards and Commissions Program, coordinating responses to Public Records
Act requests, and storage of legally mandated records. Supporting Council meetings includes
creating Council informational packets, posting meeting agendas, recording Council votes, and
creating Council minutes. Equally important, but not as routine, are administrative services related
to municipal elections.

Public Information
The Public Information unit’s primary focus is assuring timely, relevant, and accurate public
information in print, on-line, and via television and radio. Related tasks include issuing news

675

Office of the City Manager
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

releases, responding to media requests, managing content on the City’s website, developing the
Quarterly Report, and serving as Public Information Officer (PIO).

Economic Development/Business Attraction and Retention
This work unit promotes and maintains a diverse local economy with businesses that provide jobs
and services for our residents and tax revenue for the City to fund public services.

Print/Mail Services
Print Services is an internal resource serving City departments’ printing needs for large print/
copy/bindery jobs, such as Reports to Council. Specialized printing jobs are outsourced as needed,
when equipment or staff time do not permit in-house production. Daily mail service is a critical
component of supporting day-to-day operations.

Office of the City Manager
FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
Two issues are worth noting: Election Costs and City Council Budget.
Election Costs
The final cost of the November 2013 election with the inclusion of three ballot measures was
$444,752. With voter approval of Measure A on November 5, 2013, the City Charter was amended
to provide for even-year elections starting with the November 2016 election, which will allow
the City to enjoy significant savings by consolidating with Statewide General and Presidential
elections.
The charter amendment resulting from Measure A also provided for a one-time extension of current
Council terms to transition from odd-year elections to even-year elections. Councilmembers
whose terms would have expired in November 2015 (Seats 4, 5, 6 and 7) will serve until the first
meeting in January following the November 2016 election. Likewise, Councilmembers whose
terms would have expired in November 2017 (Seats 1, 2, and 3) will serve an additional year to the
first meeting in January following the November 2018 election. As a result, the recommended twoyear operating budget does not include the cost of an election. However, costs have been factored
into the 20 year financial plan.
The Office of the Registrar of Voters has provided an early estimate of election costs for the
November 2016 election for Council Seats 4, 5, 6 and 7 based on the current County Fee Schedule.
The estimate of $135,336 for the November 2016 election, plus a one-time charge of approximately
$20,000 for reprogramming the County election management system presents a potential net
savings of $376,197 by switching from an odd-year election held in November 2015 to a regular
election held in November 2016. This estimate only includes the cost of the election of the four
seats; any ballot measures added to the ballot would result in an increased cost.
City Council Budget
As noted earlier, this service area provides the resources and support needed by the City Council
to establish City policy and carry out legislative responsibilities. While Sunnyvale has traditionally
practiced program and activity-based budgeting as opposed to line item budgeting (i.e., concerned
itself more with defining specific service levels and related costs rather than focusing on line item
details such as the cost of gasoline or paper products), each operating department does perform
a rigorous review of detailed budget proposals prior to creation of the City Manager’s proposed
budget. Since Councilmembers are directly impacted by line item costs associated with this
service area, more detail regarding proposed Council-related expenses will be provided this year
for Council’s review.

Sunnyvale enjoys a reputation for being one of the safest cities in America and consistently has one
of the lowest crime rates of any city in the region and state. Much of the success can be attributed
to the community policing and problem-solving approach that is employed by the department.
Equally as important, staff assigned to fire services and fire prevention and hazardous materials
services are tasked with preventing fires through a strong fire inspection program and by providing
fire prevention education in schools, neighborhoods, and in the business community. Emergency
medical response is a top priority for the department. To increase the potential for patient survival,
both police officers and firefighters are trained as EMTs and are dispatched to every life-threatening
emergency medical call. Every emergency responder is equipped with an automatic external
defibrillator (AED) and the devices are located in every City building.
The department has strong partnerships with the City’s schools, neighborhoods, and business
community. These partnerships provide a framework to address localized problems and issues,
and allow Public Safety to leverage close relationships to address areas of mutual concern. The
department recognizes the power of an engaged community in providing public safety services and
keeping the community safe.

Programs and Services
The Department of Public Safety (DPS) is organized into nine programs: Police Services, Fire
Services, Community Safety Services, Personnel and Training Services, Investigation Services,
Communication Services, Public Safety Administration Services, Records Management and
Property Services, and Fire Prevention and Hazardous Materials Services.

Police Services
Police Services focuses on protecting the lives, property, and rights of all people by providing a
uniformed police response to both emergency and non-emergency calls for service. Officers are
assigned by team over a 24-hour time period and are responsible for a specified geographical
area of the City, their “beat.” Officers are charged with enforcing federal, state, and local laws
including traffic laws, investigating possible criminal activity, and providing crime prevention
education. Several special teams are assigned to Police Services, including Traffic Safety Education
and Enforcement (officers typically ride motorcycles), the Gang Enforcement Team (GET), and
a highly trained Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT). The chart below reflects the total
number of part 1 crimes (which include violent and property crimes) reported to the California
DOJ and FBI as per UCR reporting standards.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Fire Services
Fire Services focuses on protecting the lives and property of all people by providing primary
response to both emergency and non-emergency fire events as well as emergency medical calls
for service. Officers are assigned to one of six fire stations that provide coverage for a specific
geographical area. Nine fire engines, two trucks, and one hazardous materials/urban search and
rescue apparatus are staffed 24 hours daily. Officers assigned to Fire Services also are responsible
for more than 4,000 fire prevention inspections annually, as well as fire prevention education for
schools and businesses.

Community Safety Services
Community Safety Services collaborates with residents, businesses, government and civic
organizations, schools and community-based organizations to reduce crime pro-actively, enhance
the quality of life for residents, and make the community as safe as possible to live in.
Neighborhood Resource Officers (NROs) provide prevention education to the community.
Supervised by one Lieutenant, NROs are assigned to specific geographical areas of the City, tasked
with maintaining close partnerships with schools, neighborhood associations, and businesses.
NROs often take the lead on problem-solving initiatives by coordinating with other City resources.
Crime Prevention Assistants and Public Safety Specialists work closely with NROs to provide
support for prevention programs in schools, neighborhoods, and the business community.
Neighborhood Preservation (NP), commonly referred to as code enforcement, resolves Sunnyvale
Municipal Code violations at residential, commercial, and industrial properties. NP leverages a
wide variety of DPS resources (Police, Fire Prevention, NROs, etc.) and partners with other City
departments to address concerns throughout the City.
The Office of Emergency Services (OES) is responsible for disaster preparedness activities and
ensures readiness and coordination of City staff through education and planning. OES also provides
neighborhoods and businesses with training that will help them to be self-sufficient following a
disaster.
Animal Control is also located within Community Safety Services. Animal Control Officers are
responsible for services including licensing, responding to calls for service, and transportation
to Sunnyvale’s state-of-the-art sheltering services partner, the Humane Society Silicon Valley in
Milpitas.

Personnel and Training Services
Personnel and Training Services, in collaboration with the City’s Department of Human Resources,
has primary responsibility for recruiting, testing, hiring, and training all Public Safety employees.
Sworn candidates must meet a rigorous set of standards including written testing, oral interviews,
psychological screenings, polygraph examinations, and an in-depth background check. Successful
candidates attend a 26-week Police Academy, a 14-week Fire Academy, a 6-week Emergency
Medical Technician - Basic Academy, and must successfully pass field-training programs in both
operational bureaus - Police and Fire.
DPS training is coordinated within Personnel and Training Services to ensure all state-mandated
training requirements are met for police, fire, and emergency medical services, as well as specialized
skills training for specific assignments.

Investigation Services
Investigation Services focuses primarily on investigative follow-up of criminal cases originating
in Police Services, and preparing those cases for prosecution. Investigation Services caseloads are
managed by two Lieutenants supervising twelve detectives. There is close coordination between
this work unit and other local law enforcement agencies because many cases cross jurisdictional
boundaries. The unit also closely coordinates with the Office of the District Attorney and the Santa
Clara County Crime Lab. In recent years, technology has played an ever-increasing role in case
investigation and, consequently, detectives continue to develop expertise in computer forensics,
cell phone technology, and analysis of criminal activity within social networking websites and
financial networks.
In 2012, the Department enhanced its investigative capabilities by adding a detective to a regional
task force operated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). This partnership provides
federal funding for a portion of associated costs, but more importantly allows for a multijurisdictional approach to regional drug and gang-related activity. In FY 2013/14, the Public Safety
budget included the addition of a Senior Crime Analyst. The position was successfully recruited
for and the program has begun implementation. This new crime analysis model will provide for
department wide awareness to many agency activities. The chart on the following page provides
a 10-year history of Sunnyvale’s clearance rate for violent crimes.

Communication Services
Communication Services functions as the initial point of contact for most police and fire/medical
events, both emergency and non-emergency. Dispatchers triage approximately 115,000 incoming
calls each year originating from hard-wired phones, cell phones, and Voice over Internet Protocol
(VoIP) contacts. Each year, dispatchers coordinate the assignment of more than 50,000 police
events and 7,000 fire and emergency medical events, provide emergency medical directions
to callers reporting medical emergencies, process all requests for information by officers, and
question callers to provide the best information to emergency responders.

Public Safety Administration Services
Public Safety Administration Services provides management, coordination and support to all
department services and functions.
The Professional Standards Unit, or Internal Affairs, conducts investigations of misconduct when
warranted. Staffed by a Lieutenant and a professional staff memeber, the Professional Standards
Unit also conducts quality assurance audits to ensure compliance with laws, and with City and
department policies.

The Permits and Licensing Unit processes permits and licenses for residential and business alarm
systems, taxis, massage establishments, adult entertainment, peddlers, and pawnshops. The
administration of abandoned vehicle abatement and parking enforcement also is coordinated
within Public Safety’s Administration Services.
Administration Services is also responsible for the fiscal health of the department, ensuring fiscal
accountability is maintained across the department, and that revenue sources are explored and
leveraged. Professional staff are involved in all aspects of the City budget process, including but
not limited to, grant applications and fiscal reporting, project submittals, and the coordination
of department activities. Each year, the department is responsible for more than $4.7 million in
revenue based on fines, forfeitures, and licensing, as well as significant annual grant revenue.

Records Management and Property Services
Records Management and Property Services is the primary point of contact for non-emergency
police and fire events, by both phone and in-person contacts. This Unit provides the repository for
all police and fire event records and ensures all case files are prepared for prosecution. Records
Management is staffed 24 hours daily to ensure timely processing of information and reports,
and to ensure there is a primary point of contact for all City services after regular business hours.
Property Services is a critical function within the Unit that ensures evidence collected by officers
within Police and Investigation Services is properly secured, cataloged, and processed for case
prosecution. A secure evidence storage facility is located in the department headquarters on All
America Way, and a second long-term facility is located at the City’s Corporation Yard.

Fire Prevention and Hazardous Materials Services
Fire Prevention and Hazardous Materials Services operates under the oversight of the Fire Marshal
and is an integral part of ensuring a safe community. This Unit’s primary purpose is to prevent fires
and hazardous materials-related emergencies and to minimize injuries and property loss when a
fire or hazardous materials emergency occurs. Its core objective is to integrate public education
and outreach with fire and life safety inspections in new and existing occupancies.  
Fire Prevention Specialists conduct compliance inspections in all occupancies except single-family
residences and consult with residents and local business owners on how to maintain fire-safe
environments and building systems. Inspections of schools, residential care facilities, daycares,
nightclubs, and other occupancies with potentially vulnerable occupants are prioritized.
Fire Protection Engineers participate in predesign meetings with developers and architects, review
architectural plans and shop drawings, and conduct field inspections of passive and active fire
protection systems including fire-resistive walls, exit components, automatic sprinkler systems,

701

Public Safety

and fire alarms. These reviews and inspections ensure that engineered systems are designed and
installed in accordance with applicable codes and standards.
Technically trained Hazardous Materials Inspectors are responsible for implementing and
enforcing a broad set of hazardous materials regulations contained in six statewide hazardous
materials programs and the Fire Code. These regulations cover topics like underground storage
tank systems, accidental release prevention, hazardous waste treatment systems, toxic gas, and
general storage and use of hazardous materials. The Hazardous Materials Inspectors frequently
join the Fire Protection Engineers in predesign meetings and consultations with business owners
and developers.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
Funding for DPS represents approximately 56% of the City’s General Fund operating expenditures.
Of that amount, nearly 90% can be attributed to salaries and benefits. Public Safety managers
approach the task of developing the budget by critically examining each program and position to
ensure that services provided to the community are aligned with the department’s mission and are
responsive to the needs of the community.

Overall Program Changes
The proposed FY 2014/15 budget for the Department of Public Safety contains several changes
approved during  FY 2013/14, the full implementation of the civilianization model, and adjustments
for contract expenditures. Funding for the DPS Recruitment Projects is shifted forward to FY
2014/15 and FY 2015/16 to fill more than 20 new Public Safety Officer vacancies anticipated over
the next two years.
In FY 2013/14 a Public Safety Dispatcher position was added to the Communications team to
help balance the staffing levels. It is expected that the addition will help alleviate some overtime
costs that have been historically incurred by the program.  One additional Public Safety Officer
was also added to the department after the adoption of the FY 2013/14 Budget, although funding
is not included in the first two years of the budget due to the long lead time needed to recruit, hire
and train a new officer.  In total, three additional Public Safety Officers have been added since FY
2012/13.
While there are no major changes to the overall structure of the Department, several minor changes
are being made to realign program budgets and hours to specific services.   Additionally, the
program had budgeted $250,000 per year for booking fees to be paid to the County. However, as
the State has been reimbursing the County for booking fee expenses, the County has not needed
to bill the cities for this cost. Because the State funding for booking fees appears to be secure for
the foreseeable future, the expense is removed from the budget. Some of the savings are offset
by a one-time $100,000 increase in the contract costs for fingerprinting.  Fingerprinting costs are
expected to drop back down in the second year of the budget, but are still up $50,000 on an ongoing basis in comparison to the FY 2013/14 Budget.

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Pavement, Traffic Signs and Markings, Sidewalk Curb and Gutter Maintenance,
Street Sweeping, and Roadside Easements
The Department’s Operations Division manages pavement and concrete maintenance with the
objective of prolonging the street and sidewalk economic life to maximize the City’s investment
and reduce its liability. The Division also creates, installs, and maintains street striping, markings
and signs. In addition, it performs street sweeping to maintain clean and safe roadways and street
easements. Overlays and capital reconstruction of streets and sidewalks are managed as separate
projects by the Public Works Engineering Division.
The following chart provides a historical perspective on both the types and quantities of pavement

Public Works

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Budget Overview and Significant Changes
Beginning FY 2014/15, all development related activities will be budgeted through the City’s new
Enterprise fund. This includes most of the work hours for the development review team within
the Engineering Division as well as development supporting PW services within Transportation
and Parks Divisions. The new Enterprise Fund should provide provide better fund and service
information and capture true cost related to development activities.
Responsibilities within the Department are also shifted for optimum efficiency and service
provision. The total budgeted positions in the department for FY 2014/15 are proposed to be
reduced from 181 to 180. Several positions were restructured in the Golf Program as vacancies
occurred to reduce operating expenses.

Transportation and Traffic Operations
The Division of Transportation has been experiencing a high level of activity due largely to
the rebounding economy and peak development activity. The demand for traffic studies and
development review are at peak levels, and the FY 2014/15 budget reflects a new project to help
supplement staff to complete the backlog of studies needed, and to help assess long-term staffing
needs. Additionally, more traffic due to the economy is resulting in more damage to traffic signals
due to accidents, as well as increases in traffic complaints.
The Division will continue work on several major projects and plans, many of which are funded
through grants from the Federal Government as well as the State. These include the design of a
reconstructed Mathilda/237 interchange (in partnership with the VTA), evaluation of the VTA’s
El Camino Real Bus Rapid Transit project and north-south bus study, implementation of Safe
Routes to School projects, and monitoring of regional projects such as Caltrain electrification, and
High Occupancy Tool lane projects on routes 85, 237 and 101. The new Principal Transportation
Planner/Engineer position, added in FY 2013/14, is an additional resource for accomplishing this
work.

Street Operations
As part of the Pavement Rehabilitation capital improvement project, road restoration work began
in FY 2011/12 and will continue through 2017. With a combination of overlays, patching, chip seal
and slurry seal, the project will raise the average pavement condition index (PCI) of City streets
from “good” (70-79) to “very good” (80-89) within the next three years. A pilot project of cold
in-place recycling was used to resurface Evelyn Avenue from Mathilda to Bernardo. Additional
locations will be considered in the future where the technology is cost effective. The City received
a Certificate of Excellence from the International Pavement Management Association for the

774

Public Works

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

recycling project. Concrete Maintenance has been moved into this program for FY 2014/15. The
service of painting and maintaining red curbs was eliminated in 2003 as part of the budget service
level reductions and is being restored beginning FY 2014/15.

Street Lighting

Funding sources are being evaluated to replace more of the City’s street high pressure sodium
lights with light emitting diodes (LED). 20% of the City’s street lights have already been changed
to LED fixtures with Federal grants and PG&E rebates. Repainting of metal light poles began
in FY 2013/14, with about ¼ of the metal poles being painted. Additional projects over the next
several years will eventually result in all metal street light poles being painted for the first time in
over 40 years.

Downtown Parking Lot Maintenance
Installation of new concrete valley gutters, and spot repairs of damaged asphalt was accomplished
in FY 2013/14 at the Frances Street and Evelyn Avenue parking lot. The other parking lots will also
be spot repaired with drainage facilities installed, where needed, over the next few years. Work is
scheduled and coordinated with the downtown businesses to minimize disruption to customers.

Street Tree Services
In FY 2012/13, an additional $475,000 annually was added to this program’s budget to return
street pruning to a seven-year cycle using contract services. The contractor was able to provide
preventive maintenance pruning to over 7,000 street trees so that, if continued, the average interval
for pruning all street trees depending upon their species would be 5 years, an improvement over the
Council approved interval of seven years. In FY 2012/13, City staff pruned over 2,000 trees with
hazardous conditions so that no reported trees with hazardous conditions remained.

Concrete Maintenance
In FY 2014/15, concrete maintenance will be merged into the pavement maintenance program of
the Street Operations Division. Mitigation of displaced or damaged sidewalk and curb sections is
provided in this program. Annual funding for ongoing concrete repairs is provided in the Sidewalk,
Curb and Gutter Replacement infrastructure project, with an additional $1 million provided over
the next two years to help reduce the backlog of work. However, locations requiring replacement
continue to be reported at a higher rate than they can be repaired. In FY 2013/14, 311 locations
were repaired, and approximately 750 were reported. The current backlog on the replacement list
is approximately 1,600 locations.

Public Works Administration
Signs of an improved economy have prompted much interest in City-owned properties and their
availability for sale. City-owned property that is no longer needed to provide City services will be

775

Public Works

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

the primary focus in FY 2014/15 for Council to consider as surplus property. The Administration
Division will continue to manage real estate and leases for the City.

Capital Project Management
Upcoming work for the Capital Improvement Program includes: two major bridge projects, Fair
Oaks over Caltrain, and San Francisco-Alviso Road over Calabazas Creek; and the accelerated
pavement resurfacing program. The master planning for the Water Pollution Control Plant has
commenced and the design and environmental process will be completed over the next two years.
During this period a number of “gap” projects will be implemented to ensure the existing plant
continues to meet water quality regulations. Other utilities-related work includes the renovation
of Storm Pump Station #2 as well as ongoing replacement of sewer and water mains. Parks and
Facilities-related projects will focus on renovation of the Community Center buildings, renovation
of Lakewood Park, the new Branch Library and completion of the Seven Seas Park on Morse
Avenue. One Civil Engineer was added to this program’s budget in FY 2013/14 to help meet the
demand for the Capital Project Management group’s services.

Land Development Engineering
Development activity continues at a high level throughout the City and is expected to remain high
over the next year. The Land Development Engineering budget reflects this through an increase
in Casual employee hours, as well as a shift of the Director of Public Works hours to this program.
Additionally, some expenditures were increased to provide compliance with tightening regulations,
specifically around flood protection.
While it is anticipated that this elevated level of resources will be needed in the short term, they
will not be required over the long term, and that program costs will need to decrease along with fee
revenue. This program has been moved in its entirety to the new Development Enterprise Fund.

Neighborhood Parks and Open Space Management
Work is nearly complete to convert industrial property along Morse Avenue into the new 5.3 acre
Seven Seas Park. The new park is scheduled to be completed and opened to the public by July
2014. In anticipation of Seven Seas Park and the recently opened Swelges Park, a Park Worker I
position was approved during FY 2013/14 and fully funded beginning FY 2014/15.
The Parks Program continues to explore options to reduce its carbon footprint and make the
City’s open space more “green.” The California draught has challenged Parks to reduce its water
consumption by 20%. Some of these efforts include optimizing water usage by installing different
plantings, utilizing efficient water management, and reducing turfgrass areas. The Program’s
increasing use of integrated pest management principles has limited the numbers and amounts of
pesticides used while maintaining service levels. These efforts will continue to help improve the
quality of Sunnyvale parks and open space.

776

Public Works

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Golf and Tennis Services
The Golf and Tennis Enterprise Fund was formed in FY 2012/13 with the elimination of the
Community Recreation Fund. Since 1999, the Golf Services Program has operated both Sunken
Gardens Golf Course and the Sunnyvale Golf Course. The past eight years have shown a gradual
decline in golf participation and revenue; however, with a new restaurant operator in place, staff
expects golf revenues to improve in FY 2013/14 and continue to grow modestly.
Staff is optimistic that slow growth over the next several years is achievable in Sunnyvale, but
softness in the golf market could still pose challenges to course revenue. Vigorous efforts are
being made to both reduce costs and increase revenue. Cost reductions are being achieved through
operational efficiencies including water conservation and a restructure plan that will reduce labor
costs through personnel attrition. Creative marketing continues with a focus on the business
community and the next generation of golfers.
The Sunnyvale Tennis Center is operated by a contractor pursuant to a license agreement which
has shown to have a significant, positive impact for both operating and capital programs in the
enterprise fund. The agreement will generate license fees totaling more than two million dollars
over its 15-year term, an increase of approximately $550,000 over projections for that same time
period in the FY 2011/12 Budget. In addition, the agreement calls for a total capital investment of
$230,000 toward the improvement of various buildings at the Tennis Center, as well as payment
of up to $75,000 for electricity costs over the life of the agreement. It is also expected that tennis
programs, including instruction, leagues, camps, tournaments, and special events, will increase in
number and quality.

Fleet Services
Fleet replaced 40 of the 482 City vehicles and equipment maintained in FY 2013/14. This
included eight (8) service trucks, four (4) dumps trucks, four (4) sedans, four (4) motorcycles,
several pieces of landscape equipment, an aerial tree truck, a large loader, several pieces of road
repair equipment, and a combination hydro-excavator truck. The City also added a pavement
cutting device for adjusting manholes and a skid steer unit with trailer. For FY 2014/15, Fleet
will be charged with replacing two fire engines and procuring a new ladder truck for the new fire
station. Additionally, two unmarked police cars will be acquired for the Burglary Supression Unit.
Fleet passed its latest CHP Biennial Inspection of Terminal and received a Certificate of
Achievement for our exceptional record. Fleet also oversaw a new Tier I qualified, self-certified
Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan, and completed Hazardous Material
Business Plans for all of Operations Division facilities, including uploading into the new State
automated system.

777

Public Works

FY 2014/15 Operating Budget

Facility Services
In FY 2013/14, Facility Services completed a budgeted position restructure. The bulk of Facility
staff were classified as Facility Technician II. As positions became vacant, more specialization was
sought to allow technicians to focus on more complex matters such as heating and air conditioning
system repairs and provide more professional services. Additionally, two vacant positions were
reclassified to Facility Attendant with a focus on specific service areas. This new staffing plan
provided for improved service to the Library, the Sunnyvale Office Center, City Council meetings,
and the entire civic center. Some projects completed in FY 2013/14 include: repainted the
Public Safety Building and the upstairs recarpeted; replaced a large chiller in the Senior Center
air conditioning system and installed a new air conditioning unit at the Sunnyvale Golf Course
clubhouse. The exhaust system at some of the fire stations developed problems requiring some new
equipment and new training to allow fire engines to operate indoors during service and just prior
to responding to a fire. In FY 2014/15, Facility Services will be monitoring major improvements
to the Fremont Pool building, begin repairs and replacement of the roofs of fire stations, and repair
work to some park buildings.

Projects Budget Guide
Strategic Vision

Capital improvements substantially affect the economic
vitality and quality of life in the community.
By
definition, a capital improvement requires a major
initial investment, a significant and continuing
financial commitment, and eventual replacement.
Capital improvements require careful long-term
planning and budgeting so cyclical downturns or
unforeseen financial emergencies do not curtail
planned maintenance and necessary replacement.

The City of Sunnyvale has developed a strategic vision
to develop its capital assets so residents will continue
to realize optimal service in an aesthetically pleasing
environment. Careful management of these assets
keeps the City poised for flexible and responsive
growth, while methodical planning allows the City to
proactively prepare the ground work so it can seize
opportunities arising from a dynamic economy.
Further, this plan incorporates a broad vision that
allows the City to concentrate on the “here and now”
delivery of service, while keeping its eye on the horizon.
Applying a long-term approach allows the City to seek
economically
solid
and
financially
feasible
opportunities to “grow” toward a vision of tomorrow.

The City of Sunnyvale has a consolidated General Plan
that contains a comprehensive capital assets plan that
is specific to its focus on scope of service. This plan is
formulated through careful analysis, study, and
consideration. The Projects Budget aligns projects with
the General Plan .

In
Sunnyvale’s
multi-year
framework,
capital
improvement
maintenance
and
infrastructure
replacement are given high priority.
New capital
improvements must be supportive of the General Plan.
The City’s long-term financial plan represents the large
demand that fixed asset replacement places on any
government body.

Using the plan as a foundation, individual projects are
proposed based on the needs of the community. These
projects may be designated as capital, infrastructure,
special, or outside group funding. Capital projects
relate to construction, major improvements, or
acquisition of a structure.
Infrastructure projects
generally relate to the long-term renovation and
replacement of the City’s existing physical assets like

857

but are not limited to protection of public health and
safety, adherence to legal requirements, environmental
quality, level of public support, return on investment,
availability of financing, and relationship to Counciladopted plans.

streets, sewers, water lines, roof replacements, and
heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems
replacement. Special projects generally include onetime projects that are designed to address a specific
community need or problem.
For example, this
category could include a feasibility study on the need
for higher capacity at the Water Pollution Control
Plant. The last category is outside group funding.
These also are special projects, but are separated to
identify City contributions to local community-based
organizations.

Operating resources required to maintain new capital
improvements commencing the year the improvement
is completed are included in the City’s long-term
financial plans. Each project identifies, if applicable,
the amount and the fiscal year in which the additional
operating costs become effective.
These costs are
incorporated in the long-term financial plans for each
affected fund.

Project Planning & Budgeting
Every other year the City reviews and updates the
twenty-year Projects Budget.
Every project is
extensively reviewed. The City examines each project
in several different contexts. Consideration is given to
how the project will be financed and sometimes
whether it will be financed. Cost/benefit analyses are
conducted on the merits of the projects and where each
fits into the overall capital assets plan for the City.
Projections are formulated on expenditures and if the
project will generate revenues. All project costs are
updated to reflect current requirements.

The City carefully considers each project’s short-term
and long-term effects against current policy directives,
citywide needs, on-going operational needs, and
budgetary constraints.
These considerations are
applied across the entire twenty-year planning horizon
and to all projects, no matter their cost or scope. The
effect is a long-term, comprehensive project plan that is
synchronized with a balanced operating budget. This
approach provides a complete financial analysis of the
impact of all projects proposed for funding in the
immediate year, as well as in future years. It also
provides a “big picture” perspective of how the projects
are synchronized with the operating budget.

In order to provide a sound foundation for decision
making on capital improvements and other projectrelated efforts, the City applies extensive criteria to
determine the value of each project. Criteria include,

Infrastructure Expenditures

financing

Land Acquisition. A high priority will be given to
acquiring undeveloped land needed to meet City goals.
Developed land should be acquired in a reasonable
time prior to when the property is required for City
purposes.

Council Fiscal Policy identifies a number of capital
improvement and related policies designed to maximize
value and cost-effectiveness of the City’s infrastructure.
Several key policies include those relating to plan,
design, and funding.

Reserves. Provide a prudent level of reserves for
future unexpected expenses and revenue declines; to
accumulate funds to support future planned capital
improvements; and to reduce the variability between
high and low expenditure years in the Twenty-Year
Resource Allocation Plan.

Capital Improvement Plan. High priority should be
given to replacing capital improvements prior to the
time they have deteriorated to the point where they are
hazardous, incur high maintenance costs, negatively
affect property values, or no longer serve their intended
purposes. Priority will be given to the repair and
replacement of existing infrastructure as compared to
the provision of new or expanded facilities.
Capital Improvement Design.
The planning and
design of all capital improvements should be based on
standards that minimize construction costs, while
assuring acceptable useful life and reducing
maintenance requirements.
Value engineering
processes will be used when necessary and
appropriate.
Capital Improvement Funding.
In most cases,
governmental capital improvements should be funded
on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Alternate financing
strategies may be considered in light of the specific

859

Unfunded Projects
Over the last several years, staff has made a concerted
effort to identify all of the unfunded capital projects
that pose a significant liability in the long term.
Unfunded projects fall into several categories, with
many having potential funding sources that can be
pursued.
Project Information Sheets for these
unfunded projects can be found in numerical order in
each project category following the Project Information
Sheets for funded projects.
In addition, there are many unfunded projects
identified in the long range plans for traffic and
transportation that guide the development of the
capital projects budget in the short- and long-term.
These long range plans are discussed in more detail
under the Traffic and Transportation projects category.
The full listing of projects for this plan is also provided.
For those projects on the lists that are not included in
the projects budget, at such time as funding becomes
available, those projects will be evaluated and moved
into the projects budget as appropriate.

Traffic & Transportation
Major Projects

A well planned and maintained transportation
infrastructure is a critical component for ensuring
livable local communities, balancing housing and jobs,
and supporting economic development. Sunnyvale has
developed an excellent transportation infrastructure,
but regional and local growth and the passage of time
put continual strain on capacity and maintenance
needs. The City has proactively conducted long range
planning for traffic and transportation needs for a
number of years and is actively involved in countywide
planning efforts. Several long range plans guide the
development of the projects budget for the short and
long term. These are: Valley Transportation Plan (VTP)
2035, Transportation Strategic Program, Downtown
Specific Plan (2003), Bicycle Capital Improvement
Program, 2007 Pedestrian Safety and Opportunities
Study, Tasman/Fair Oaks Bicycle and Pedestrian
Circulation Plan, and Moffett Park Specific Plan. Each
of these plans identifies traffic and transportation
projects that are important for a particular area, the
City, and/or the region. These plans and a listing of
their Sunnyvale transportation projects are detailed
later in this section. These plans allow the City to
undertake a coordinated traffic and transportation
capital projects program and to position itself to
compete strongly for outside specialized discretionary
funding as it becomes available.

Pavement Rehabilitation and Annual Slurry Seal of
City Streets. Each year the Department of Public
Works Pavement Operations staff surveys one half of
the City’s streets and inputs the data in the City’s
pavement management system. The system produces
a list of deteriorated streets and plans are made to
repair, slurry seal, double chip seal, overlay, or
reconstruct the streets as needed. A constant level of
funding for pavement rehabilitation is budgeted in the
operating program. The Annual Slurry Seal of City
Streets project covers contract construction costs of

Fair Oaks Avenue Overhead Bridge Repair. The State
of California Department of Transportation (CalTrans)
rated the existing Fair Oaks Avenue Overhead bridge
“structurally deficient” in 2004 during their biannual
inspection. The rating is primarily due to severe deck
cracking and spalling, inadequate sidewalk width,
barrier railings, approach railing and lateral clearance
to the columns. Funding for this project includes

Unfunded Projects

design and construction. Upon completion, the
estimated life of the bridge will be 40 years. The design
phase of this project and environmental studies began
in FY 2012/13. Design is expected to be complete in
late 2014 and construction will begin in 2015.

Unfunded projects fall into two primary categories.
First, several projects are in the unfunded category
until a funding source is identified. Many of these
projects are strong candidates for outside grants. When
a funding source is secured, the project will move into
the funded status. Second, projects have been placed
in the unfunded category if the timing of the project is
dependent on actions from another agency. For
example, the Bernardo Avenue Caltrain Undercrossing
must be coordinated with the California High Speed
Train project, and the funding sources for this project
will be impacted by this coordination effort.

The total project cost is budgeted at $22.8 million. A
funding application for this project was submitted to
CalTrans for Highway Bridge Program funds, which
were received for the Preliminary Engineering phase.
Additional applications to fund future phases of the
project will be submitted to CalTrans. It is anticipated
that 88% of the project cost will be covered by grant
funding, with the remainder to be funded by reserves
in the Infrastructure Fund.

In addition to the unfunded projects, the seven long
range traffic and transportation plans each contain a
list of specific projects. The project lists are included in
the next section within the description of the specific
long range plan. If a project has secured funding and is
budgeted or completed, it is noted. For the remaining
projects, they will move into the City’s projects budget
when funding sources are secured. These project lists
are updated annually to track the progress the City is
making toward the long range goals outlined in these
plans. Some projects, particularly many of those in the
VTP 2035, are not the responsibility of the City and
therefore will not move into the City’s projects budget.
However, staff will continue to monitor and update the

Improvements.
Work has begun on design of the reconstruction of the
Mathilda Avenue interchanges with SR 237 and US
101. The objective is to provide for safe and efficient
movement of traffic at one of the busiest and most
complex roadway systems in the region. Necessary
documents are being prepared, such as CalTrans
submissions, environmental documents, and Plans,
Specification, and Estimates. Design of the project has
been funded by a $2 million grant from the Valley
Transportation Authority, combined with a $2 million
City match. The total estimated construction cost is
$16.5 million, half of which is budgeted to be funded
by the City.

Traffic and Transportation Long-Range Plans
There are several Traffic & Transportation planning documents that will inform capital projects over the next
20 years. As funding opportunities present themselves, individual projects will be brought before the Council
for consideration and budget appropriation. Additionally, some projects are included in more then one of the
planning documents listed below, as these planning documents often overlap in scope and purpose in the
processes of long-range planning for the City. The eight planning documents are detailed below.

Valley Transportation Plan

The Valley Transportation Plan, or VTP, is the long-range vision for transportation in Santa Clara County. The
Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), in its role as the Congestion Management Agency (CMA) for Santa
Clara County, is responsible for preparing and periodically updating the VTP every 4-5 years on a cycle
coinciding with the update of the Bay Area’s Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The current plan is titled
VTP 2035. VTA is currently in the process of updating the plan. VTP 2040 will identify major regional
transportation programs and projects for Santa Clara County and present priorities for Federal and State
transportation funding against funding constraints. Under guidelines by the Federal government, long-range
transportation plans must be financially constrained. Constrained projected are those funded with projected
revenues from sources that currently exist, such as sales tax measures, Federal flexible formula funds, or gas
tax subventions, and sources that can be reasonably expected to be available during the life of the plan.
Unconstrained projects are those that do not have fund sources identified. The plan also includes projects
that do not meet the VTP criteria for constrained funding, but are considered to be improvements of regional
significance. These are identified in the plan as unconstrained projects. City staffs participate in the process
of developing the Valley Transportation Plan and submit candidate projects for consideration for inclusion in
the plan. Projects must appear in the VTP and RTP in order to be eligible for most federal, state, and regional
funding. The City submits candidate projects which are subsequently ranked and determined to be
constrained or unconstrained.
It should be noted that the VTP is intended solely as a planning and policy framework, and the projects
identified for the City of Sunnyvale are not to be used as a programming document for which the City is
responsible for carrying out. Highway and expressway projects are shown here for informational purposes
only.

Transportation Strategic Program

Initiated in 1998, the Transportation Strategic Program (TSP) provides the financial basis for the City’s
current land use and transportation plan. It is updated every 5-6 years with the update of the Computerized
Transportation Model (Project 825530), which upholds the fair valuation of the Transportation Impact Fee.
Without adoption of a program and identification of funding for improvements, traffic congestion could
negatively affect the City’s development, economy, neighborhoods, and environmental health, among other
things.
The TSP supports land development potential envisioned by the General Plan Land Use and Transportation
Element and was approved by Council November 11, 2003 (RTC 03-385). Key components of the
Transportation Strategic Program effort were the establishment of a revenue mechanism to recognize the
impact of new development on future forecast transportation deficiencies. Council approved the imposition of
a two-tiered Transportation Impact Fee to address the transportation capacity needs for areas inside (north of
Route 237) and outside the Moffett Industrial Park (south of Route 237), execution of a cost sharing
agreement with the County of Santa Clara for County Expressway improvements, and pursuit of outside
matching funding for certain transportation improvements. It should be noted that the timing of these
projects is uncertain given that they are dependent on traffic congestion from the growth of the City; project
timing will be reassessed periodically. The primary sources of funding will be grants and traffic impact fees.
The TSP and Traffic Impact Fees were updated and approved by City Council in December 2013. Funds from
Traffic Impact Fees will be augmented in many cases by State or regional grant funds. The funded amount
shown below is the amount of City Traffic Impact Fees currently allocated towards listed projects.

Downtown Specific Plan (2003)

The 2003 Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) is an update to the 1993 Downtown Specific Plan. A key component
of the plan is traffic and transportation improvements. It builds on the General Plan land uses and heights,
approved by Council in June 2003, and provides more specific direction about public and private
improvements, including goals and policies, building design guidelines, and infrastructure improvements. The
2003 DSP was approved by Council on October 14, 2003 (RTC 03-358), along with Zoning Code updates to
reflect permitted land uses and applicable development standards.
The DSP area comprises roughly 125 acres, generally bounded by Evelyn Avenue to the north, Bayview Ave to
the east, El Camino Real to the south, and Charles St to the west. Its focus is on three goals: (1) Establishing
a common vision for the downtown, (2) defining a unique market niche, and (3) creating the framework to link
together current and future downtown projects into a vibrant, cohesive place.
It is expected that projects identified as part of the 2003 DSP will be grant funded with the City’s share being
20%, and all projects being revenue dependent.

Bicycle Capital Improvement Program

The Bicycle Capital Improvement Program (Bicycle CIP) was developed in order to meet the City’s goal of
encouraging the use of alternative modes of transportation to the automobile in November 2000. The physical
configuration of all major roadways in the City was assessed and actions needed to develop bike lanes on a
street-segment basis were presented. The Bicycle CIP was approved by Council on December 12, 2000 (RTC
00-422), and is intended to be used as a guide, not an action plan.
It is expected that the projects identified as part of the Bicycle CIP will be grant funded with the City’s share
being 20%, and all projects being revenue dependent. Furthermore, where the goals of the Bicycle CIP fit in
with the VTP 2035 Bicycle Program and comply with its various regional, state, and federal rules for funding,
the City will pursue these funds. These projects will improve the service level for bicyclists living and working
in Sunnyvale.

2007 Pedestrian Safety and Opportunities Study

The 2007 Pedestrian Safety and Opportunities Study (PedSOS) is a study issue that originated from the
Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Commission and was supported by Council to study the state of pedestrian
facilities on major public streets and identify opportunities for improvement. The PedSOS report characterizes
and quantifies existing pedestrian activity and facilities in the City, concluding with the identification and
prioritization of pedestrian improvements on major City streets. It also recommends enhancement projects in
Pedestrian Opportunity District areas.
Council directed that projects identified in the PedSOS be revenue dependent. Proposed projects in the
PedSOS can be funded by a variety of local, regional, state, and federal sources, including: Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ), Surface Transportation Program (STP), Community
Based Transportation Planning (CBTP), Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA), Transportation
Development Act (TDA), Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), and Development Fees (such as the
Transportation Impact Fee). The City has secured three Safe Routes to School grants and a Transportation
Development Act grant that funds a number of PedSOS improvements in the amount of $2.52 million. CDBG
funds have also been allocated to construct accessible curb ramps where none currently exist.

Tasman/Fair Oaks Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation Plan

The Tasman/Fair Oaks Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation Plan was developed to complement a re-zoning of
the area around the Fair Oaks light rail station to higher density residential from low-rise industrial. The City
sought to encourage growth in the area to develop in a way that promotes the use of public transit and
encourages bicycle and pedestrian activity. The Plan identifies a set of streetscape enhancements to apply to
roads and paths in the area, including new sidewalks, wide sidewalks, specialized lighting, enhanced
intersection features for pedestrians, gateways and other features of interest, and a bike path along the East
Channel. While most improvements would be provided by developers as properties redevelop, a Sense of Place
fee was enacted to fund improvements in areas not subject to redevelopment like the East Channel Trail and
areas where sidewalks are not anticipated to be provided by redevelopment. To date, most improvements are
completed or in progress, with the exception of the East Channel Trail.

Fair Oaks Junction Sense of Place Plan

The Fair Oaks Junction Sense of Place Plan was developed to augment a re-zoning of the Futures Area 6,
which is generally bound by Wolfe Road to the north, North Fair Oaks Avenue to the west, Arques Avenue to
the south and Britton Avenue to the east. Future Area 6 is one of several sites in Sunnyvale that were zoned
to transition from Industrial to Residential (ITR) uses. In July 1993 a General Plan Amendment was executed
by the City Council designating the parcels in this area to allow up to 27 dwelling units per acre. Since the
original General Plan and subsequent Zoning Changes, the area has been slow to transition to residential
uses. By 2012 several parcels were redeveloped to residential uses which initiated the creation of a residential
neighborhood. In 2011, the City Council ranked a Study Issue to study the pedestrian and bicycle circulation
and sense of place in the area. The Fair Oaks/Wolfe neighborhood is small and lacks a cohesive network for
pedestrians and bicyclists.
The goals of the Fair Oaks Junction Sense of Place Plan are to:
1. Enhance quality of life for residents within North Fair Oaks and Wolfe area (Futures Area 6) and vicinity
through improved pedestrian access to parks and open space, schools, retail amenities, and public
transportation.
2. Encourage increased pedestrian, bicycle, and transit use through streetscape improvements, land use
planning, and architectural design.
3. Aim to establish complete street designs that accommodate movements of all modes of transportation
including bicycle, pedestrian, and transit traffic.
The Plan identifies a set of streetscape enhancements to apply to roads and paths in the area, including new
sidewalks, wide sidewalks, specialized lighting, enhanced intersection features for pedestrians, gateways and
other features of interest, and a bike path along the East Channel. While most improvements would be
provided by developers as properties redevelop, a Sense of Place fee was also enacted to fund improvements in
areas not subject to redevelopment and areas where sidewalks are not anticipated to be provided by
redevelopment.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is intended to provide matching funds for the City's portion of undergrounding of overhead utilities work. The Sunnyvale Municipal Code (SMC) Title 19.38.100 requires that
developments underground overhead utilities. The City is sometimes obligated to pay for portions of utility undergrounding that extend beyond property lines or cross City streets. Developers are
reimbursed by the City for doing undergrounding work beyond developer’s obligations.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
In circumstances where the developer is required by the SMC to underground utilities, the City must participate accordingly.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Sunnyvale Municipal Code Title 18 requires that developments provide and fund necessary public improvements to meet the needs of private development. The City requires developers to upsize
or upgrade improvements in the public right-of-way in excess of the Code’s requirement. The City is obligated to reimburse developers for the portions of work which developers would not
otherwise be required to provide. This project provides funding for that reimbursement.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The cost of the improvements could vary depending on the particular site. A budget modification may be needed for a specific project depending on the type and size of the project. However,
funding has been set for $5,000 every 5 years to approximate the total impact of this project on the 20-year plan. Other options are to either amend the Municipal Code to change City's obligation or
to postpone the City's portion of repairs. Postponing the completion of improvements is not cost effective and could present unsafe conditions.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for future traffic signal construction and modification. This project involves making major signal modifications and/or installing new traffic signals that may be
necessary. The locations of these signal improvements are often determined by recent community activity or by unpredictable changes in traffic conditions.
A new traffic signal system at Duane/Britton will be designed in FY 2012/13, with construction anticipated to begin in FY 2013/14.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project allows the City to respond more quickly and efficiently to future traffic signal needs.

Fiscal Impact
Annual operating costs are required for electricity and maintenance/repairs of the new signals. This project is funded by Cumulative Traffic Mitigation Fees.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funds to complete minor repairs to City-owned bridges and culverts inspected biannually by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). There are 99 bridges and
box culverts in the City of Sunnyvale. Caltrans inspects some of the bridges every two years and submits a report to the City with recommendations for repairs. Once a bridge is inspected, it will
not be inspected again for two years, and not all the bridges are covered at one time. The inspections are conducted by Caltrans from time to time, and reports are submitted accordingly. This
project provides funds for minor repairs that will need to be performed by a qualified contractor. Funds are also needed to prepare the backup for funding applications that are submitted when major
work is involved.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The minor work performed with this project is necessary to maintain the serviceability of our bridges. The repairs are needed to stop further deterioration and avoid hazardous conditions. These
funds are utilized for only minor repairs. In case of major repairs, outside funding is explored.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Many of the City’s 2,300 fluted streetlight poles are showing significant wear and tear, causing deterioration. This project will provide funds to repaint the poles to prevent further corrosion and
deterioration. Repainting will be done by outside contract, with about 25% of the poles painted every three years. The first 25% was done in FY 2012/13. Poles will be monitored and evaluated for
repainting as needed, with an expectation that painting should be approximately every 20 years.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will preserve the City’s investment in its street lighting infrastructure by protecting light poles against corrosion. This will also present a good public image as an economic center.
Failure to protect this infrastructure investment can add to blight and become a public relations issue.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund. No additional operating costs are required.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the replacement of traffic signal controllers, cabinets and components at approximately 15-20 year intervals due to obsolescence or changes in functionality. This project
improves traffic flow at intersections and increases the reliability of the City's signal control equipment. The City has a total of approximately 129 signal controllers. The replacement costs vary
depending on the location of the controllers. The replacement schedule is based on years of service, date of last upgrade, or as needed due to wear and tear. These computer-based controllers and
other major control components deteriorate with time and replacement parts become difficult to find as the equipment is phased out of manufacture. Costs are budgeted on a specific replacement
schedule. Currently, staff is working on replacing equipment at the following locations: Caribbean/Twin Creeks; Fair Oaks/Evelyn; Sunnyvale-Saratoga/Alberta-Harwick; and SunnyvaleSaratoga/Cheyenne-Connemara.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Existing controllers slated for replacement do not meet City standards. These controllers are not capable of coordination and will not communicate on existing City systems. They are obsolete and
replacement parts are no longer available. If not replaced, possible future failure will require replacement and will cause long-term shutdown while equipment is ordered and delivered. Project costs
are based on bids and prices from manufacturers and contractors.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for design and construction for replacement of traffic signal underground conduits and signal pole structures at the end of their estimated life span. Underground
cables and conduits have a life expectancy of approximately 35 years.
Locations identified for replacement are evaluated by location specific assessments based upon an inventory of traffic signal life cycles. The Fair Oaks Avenue at Wolfe Road Traffic signal was
completed. The following traffic signal modifications/rebuild at four locations were designed in FY 2012/13: Arques/Oakmead, Homestead/Hollenbeck, Mathilda/Olive, and Hollenbeck/Alberta.
Construction for two of these traffic signals is anticipated in FY 2013/14, with the remaining two to be constructed in FY 2014/15. Beginning in FY 2015/16, design and construction will be
performed in alternating years.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Underground conduits/substructures, as they age and corrode, become filled with dirt and water and cannot be cleaned. Failure to replace systems may result in wire failure in the future with no
means of quick replacement and signal shutdown for multiple days until replaced. Traffic signal poles and associated hardware are evaluated for replacement concurrently in order to consider
updated design standards and condition of infrastructure. Project costs are based on bid history and construction prices received. Near term funding levels are calibrated to match conditions in the
field.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds replacement of red, yellow, and green traffic signal light emitting diode arrays (LEDs) as they approach the end of their useful life. The LEDs are warranted for seven years, but
experience has indicated that ten years is the actual life cycle. LEDs result in a significant cost savings to the City in power consumption and annual replacement costs. In the past, incandescent
lights were used for traffic signals. The incandescent lights were replaced every 1-2 years and consumed 10-15 times more electricity than LEDs.
The cost estimates are based on current market prices for LED equipment. Starting in FY 2016/17, funds are budgeted for replacement of red (2nd cycle), yellow, and green LEDs and pedestrian
crossing indicators.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will replace existing LED traffic signal indications once they become obsolete, reducing City liability and complying with Federal, State and accepted professional standards. Cost
savings from the initial installation of LEDs are already reflected in the operating budget.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds a bicycle map revision every 10 years to account for changes and additions to the City's bicycle network. The next revision is scheduled for FY 2015/16. The City typically
completes 2-3 bicycle projects per year, which result in significant changes and warrant a bicycle map revision every 10 years. The project cost includes conducting in-depth research of the bicycle
routes and publishing a ranking of the degree of difficulty of each route.
Per Section 10.56.286 of the City's Municipal Code, "There shall be maintained on file in the Department of Public Works and available for inspection by the public, a map showing the bicycle
lanes, paths, routes, and bikeways, as established from time to time by the City Council." The Sunnyvale Bicycle Plan Action Statement BP.A1.a articulates that a new map showing bicycle paths,
routes and lanes and their suitability ratings should be published periodically. An update of the map will reflect changes. All expenditures for this project will go towards the cost of printing the
maps in addition to the labor needed to update the street bicycle suitability ratings and other elements of the map. The latest revision of the map was completed in FY 2005/06.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will improve communication with residents about the City's existing bicycle facilities. The bicycle map is an essential promotional tool to implement bicycle policy.

Fiscal Impact
Staff will pursue grant funds and only use General Fund if other funding sources are not secured.

Richard Chen

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for ongoing roadway infrastructure rehabilitation. Initially, these funds will be utilized to accelerate street repairs to return the average Pavement Condition Index (PCI) of
City streets to a level of 80+. Future funding is intended to maintain the PCI level of 80+. Each year the Department of Public Works Pavement Operations staff surveys one half of the City’s
streets and inputs the data in the City’s pavement management system. The system produces a list of deteriorated streets and plans are made to repair, slurry seal, double chip seal, overlay, or
reconstruct the streets as needed.
A Pavement System Maintenance Study commenced in FY 2012/13 and will be completed in early FY 2013/14. The study will guide the City on the most efficient and cost effective way to
maintain City streets. The result of the study may affect the current pavement rehabilitation plan.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is essential to maintain the economic vitality of the City. The alternative is to not fund this project and delay needed repairs. If repairs are delayed, minor street rehabilitation measures
will become major street replacement projects at much higher cost.
The City has seen the effects of its decision to reduce the service level for street maintenance. Prior to 2006, the City's PCI was 85. Due to a short-term budgetary crisis, annual spending was
reduced and the PCI dropped below 80. In 2010, the Pavement Management Program (PMP) identified the deterioration of our streets would require $12.5 million to return to a PCI of 80.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund, the SB83 VRF Road Improvement Fund, and the Gas Tax Fund. The project does not affect the operating budget.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for replacement of damaged conduits, wiring, and other related components throughout the City on an as-needed basis as problems are identified by staff. Many of the
City’s streetlights have underground conduits that have been in place for many years and are showing deterioration. Failures are generally the result of heavy vehicles driving over the conduits in
shallow driveways, parking strips crushing the conduit, or by water intrusion creating electrical shorts. The budget is based upon replacing approximately 21,000 linear feet every three years, with
some funding available on an annual basis to fix unanticipated, immediate repairs, if necessary. Any funds left each year should be carried forward to provide additional funding for subsequent
years. At some point additional funding may be required if conduits begin to fail in large numbers, precluding the benefits of spot repairs. The City has an estimated 200 linear miles of conduits,
with several known locations of failure.
Future locations will be based upon damaged locations identified over the next three-year period, except for small spot repairs that can be corrected with the small annual budget referenced above.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The alternative to this project would be to not fix broken conduits, which would result in dark streets. Hazardous situations could occur if the conduit breaks in such a way that a street light pole is
energized; however, this is not a very common occurrence.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for the Transportation Model Update. The City's Transportation Impact Fee is based upon long range projections of roadway capacity needs from a computerized
Transportation Model.
Updating the Transportation Model provides the City with a basis for upholding a fair valuation of the Transportation Impact Fee. This important source of transportation improvement revenue
benefits residents, travelers, and developers in the City by allocating a fair share of the cost of transportation system expansion to the land development contributing to the need for the
improvements. These improvements will be needed to support the build-out of the land use projections of the General Plan. Therefore, the model update is necessary every five years over the life
of the General Plan. The impact fee was adopted by City Council on November 11, 2003 (RTC 03-385). The RTC states that costs of administration of the impact fee are anticipated to be covered
by interest on funds accrued. These funds will be used for professional computer transportation modeling services.
In FY 2012/13 Council Approved Budget Modification #25 to accelerate the scheduled update to the transportation model in response to increasing land development proposals. The next update is
scheduled for FY 2017/18.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This model needs to be updated on a regular basis to reflect changes to the use of land, the transportation system, and City land use and transportation policy. Updating of the Transportation Impact
Fee is required by Government Code 66001. Should the transportation model become outdated, it could subject the City to a challenge and potential loss of the Transportation Impact Fee revenues.

Fiscal Impact
This project is by the Capital Projects Fund/Transportation Impact Fee sub-fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is the result of the recommendation made in the biannual inspection report by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Caltrans is required under Title 23 of the Code of
Federal regulations to inspect bridges and culverts every two years. This structure was rated "Structurally Deficient" in 2004. This rating was influenced primarily by severe deck cracking and
spalling, inadequate sidewalk width, barrier railings, approach railing, and lateral clearance to the columns. It is essential for the City to complete these repairs to protect the integrity of the
structure. Budgeted funds include design and construction. The estimated life of the repaired bridge is anticipated to be 40 years.
Staff completed initial work and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) field review to obtain a commitment of Caltrans Federal Highway Bridge funding for the Preliminary Engineering
phase.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Correcting the deficiencies will extend the life of the bridge and move it off the deficiency list. The design and environmental studies began in September, 2012. Design will be completed in late
2014. Construction will start in 2015.

Fiscal Impact
A funding application for this project was submitted to Caltrans for Highway Bridge Program (HBP) funds. Funding has been obtained for the Preliminary Engineering phase. Funding for Right of
Way engineering and Construction engineering will be submitted to Caltrans in the future. Grant funding will account for 88% of the total cost, with the remaining 12% funded by reserves in the
Infrastructure Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Since FY 2003/04, the City has installed seven in-pavement lighted crosswalk warning systems at locations throughout the City. In FY 2012/13, six systems are scheduled to be installed, and in FY
2013/14 five more will be installed. These installations have been funded from various grant sources. This project provides funding for the replacement costs of the lights, systems batteries, push
buttons, flashing beacons, signs, and systems controller. The systems have an assumed life cycle of eight years, based on the City’s experience and information from the manufacturers. Funds are
budgeted according to the installation date of the various systems.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Installation of the pedestrian lighted crosswalk improves pedestrian safety. Four crosswalk systems were upgraded in FY 2011/12 and one system was replaced completely in FY 2012/13. The next
cycle of repairs starts again in FY 2016/17 for two systems installed in FY 2009/10. For the remaining systems, the repair cycle starts again in FY 2018/19.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds the replacement costs of the battery backup systems that have been installed on all the traffic signals in the City. Batteries have a five-year life expectancy, and the City replaces
batteries over a four-year period concurrent with the installation of the original devices. Costs are based on current market pricing, adjusted for inflation. Inverters and wiring, separate from
batteries, typically last 15-20 years. Replacement of the inverters and wiring is scheduled to start in FY 2025/26.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Installation of Uninterruptible Power Supplies at traffic signals reduces congestion and improves safety for all users of the City’s roadway system during planned and unplanned power outages. If
PG&E power is lost, the traffic signals will continue to function in a normal fashion and motorists will not be required to treat dark signalized intersections as All-Way Stop controlled intersections.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is identified in the Tasman/Fair Oaks Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation Plan. The project is located in the area bounded by Tasman Drive, Morse Avenue, Weddell Drive and Fair
Oaks Avenue. The project includes sidewalk construction, intersection enhancements, bus stop enhancements, monument and gateway signs, and other improvements.
The initial project was completed in FY 2010/11. Remaining grant funds were used to expand the scope of this project, providing more of the planned sidewalks and lighting to the area. Therefore,
a second phase was developed to construct additional improvements; however, the available grant funds did not cover the entire proposed scope and a downscoped Phase II project was constructed
in 2012.
Additional improvements are planned in Phase III of this project including pedestrian improvements and sidewalk construction along Fair Oaks and Weddell, lighting installation on the west side of
Morse Avenue south of Tasman Drive, and enhanced crosswalks along Morse Avenue at the John W. Christian Greenbelt and Weddell Drive. These remaining improvements are scheduled to be
constructed in FY 2016/17, however, these improvements are revenue dependent as a funding source has not yet been identified.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The project will increase the service level by improving livability for the residents in the neighborhood. It also encourages increased pedestrian, bicycle and transit use through streetscape
improvements, land use planning and architectural design.

Fiscal Impact
Phases I and II were 80% grant funded by the Valley Transit Authority (VTA) Community Design and Transportation (CDT) Capital Grant Program. The remaining 20% was funded by developer
contributions, the Bay Area Air Quality Management Grant, and the Transportation and Traffic Division operating program. Phase III will be dependent on securing outside funding.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is to place overhead utilities underground along various arterials per the City's prioritized list. Funding shown is the City's share of support in order to qualify for PG&E's Rule 20A
funds. Under the Rule 20A program, the City is responsible for the surveying, preparing base maps, and for connecting and installing new street lights to replace those formerly on wood utility
poles. The City funds include these costs plus engineering costs related to the district formation and Rule 20A projects.
City Council approved new prioritizing criteria (to match Rule 20A requirements) and approved a new list of prioritized projects. Council also approved creation of the next two Underground
Utility Districts: a $4 million project at Fair Oaks Avenue between Evelyn and El Camino Real and a $7.4 million project at Wolfe Road between Old San Francisco Road and Homestead. These
were submitted to PG&E and are in PG&E’s queue with other state-wide projects for design and implementation. Design for the Fair Oaks project commenced in 2012 and construction is expected
to be completed in 2015. Funds in FY 2013/14 through FY 2016/17 cover the City’s cost for these two projects. Funds in FY 2017/18 and FY 2018/19 cover the City’s cost for a future
undergrounding project at Homestead Road.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Each year PG&E allocates points that relate to dollars to share with cities in undergrounding of their facilities. These Rule 20A funds can only be used by creating an Underground Utility District,
in accordance with the rules.
Placing utilities underground makes them less likely to cause a hazard during or after an earthquake or accident, and removes the lines and poles from conflicts with street trees and sidewalk access,
while improving the streetscape aesthetics.

Fiscal Impact
Undergrounding utility distribution lines require service to streetlights and replacement of streetlights on utility poles at the City's cost, as well as preliminary engineering. There will be no impact
to the operating budget. This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is the result of the recommendations made in the biannual inspection report by Caltrans. Caltrans is required under Title 23 of the Code of Federal regulations to inspect bridges and
culverts periodically. This bridge, located on Old Mountain View-Alviso Road near State Route 237, was declared "Structurally Deficient" by Caltrans in June 2005. The structure crosses the
Calabazas Creek, which is owned by Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD), and the bridge is shared between the City of Sunnyvale and the City of Santa Clara. The useful life of the
replaced bridge is anticipated to be 40 years. Replacement of the bridge also provides an opportunity to extend the Calabazas Creek Trail underneath the bridge via a low water crossing. This will
be evaluated for inclusion in the project scope.
Staff completed initial work and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) field review to obtain a commitment of Caltrans-administered federal Highway Bridge Program funding for the
Preliminary Engineering phase. The entire project cost is estimated at approximately $9.9 million. The City's share would be half of the 11.47% local share, with the other half coming from the
City of Santa Clara. Timing of the project is dependent on this funding.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The purpose of the Calabazas Creek Bridge Replacement Project is to upgrade the safety of the structure. The structure will be widened to accommodate bicycle lanes and sidewalks, include safety
lighting, and raise the elevation of the structure out of the 100 year floodplain. Associated improvements to conform the new bridge structure to the existing street widths within the individual
jurisdictions will be required. A design consultant will be selected in FY 2012/13, with design anticipated to commence in FY 2013/14.

Fiscal Impact
The Sunnyvale local share of this project is funded the Gas Tax Fund. The remainder is funded by federal Highway Bridge Program funds. A cooperative agreement between the Cities of
Sunnyvale and Santa Clara has been executed which details out cost sharing responsibilities between the two agencies. The Caltrans “Authorization to Proceed” for design activities has been
received.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project involves preparation of Caltrans required Project Initiation Document (PID); environmental documents; and Plans, Specifications, and Estimate (PS&E) for a roadway improvement to
reconstruct the interchanges of Mathilda Avenue with SR 237 and US 101. The intent of improvement is to simplify weaving operations, improve queuing at signals, and provide more efficient
traffic flow. The project under study involves re-design of traffic signals and re-routing of a frontage road and freeway ramps. The purpose of the project is to provide for safe and efficient
movement of traffic at one of the busiest and most complex roadway systems in the region. This will support planned growth as called for in the General Plan. The design and environmental
documents will be prepared in partnership with the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) to secure California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) approval of the project concept and position
the project for future Federal or State funding.
In 2013, the City was awarded a $2 million grant by the VTA for the design phase of the project. The City is providing a $2 million local match. These funds will cover the estimated $4 million
design cost. The total estimated construction cost is $16.5 million, half of which is planned to be funded by the City.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This alternative was the result of a 2004 comprehensive corridor study, which evaluated a number of roadway improvement alternatives in the Mathilda/SR 237/US 101 area. This project and the
Mary Avenue Extension were identified as the most effective mid-range improvement alternatives. The VTA has recognized this project as a regional freeway improvement priority and desires for
the City to complete project development work in order to ready the project for future outside funding. Completion of this project will enhance opportunities for future construction funding. This
project is a lowest cost alternative for improving roadway operations and capacity in an area with limited construction alternatives.

Fiscal Impact
The City’s share of the design and construction costs will be funded from Transportation Impact Fee revenue. The design and construction budget is based on estimates from the VTA, which is
experienced with the preparation of design and environmental documents for projects of this magnitude.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project covers contract construction costs of slurry sealing a portion of the City's streets each year. The corrective maintenance work required prior to the re-surfacing is done by the City and
the costs are included in the Pavement Operations program. The annual pavement condition survey is used to determine which streets will most benefit from a slurry seal. Slurry seal is most
effective in protecting and extending the life of a pavement surface when applied on a regular cycle, normally every 7 to 10 years.
Slurry seal is one form of street resurfacing, which is required periodically by asphalt streets. It is the least expensive, easiest to apply, improves other resurfacing products, and has the lowest life
cycle cost for the benefit received in extending the life of a road. Slurry seal is the application of a slurry of oil, water, sand and selected additives to the surface of a street, which, when allowed to
dry/cure, provides a thin wearing surface, and seals the underlying surface materials to assist in blocking the access of water into the subgrade. Slurry seal is only effective when used to extend the
life of pavement that is already in very good condition. If a pavement surface is allowed to deteriorate below the level of "very good," then other, more expensive, surfacing products are necessary.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Slurry seal is a maintenance treatment that extends the life of a road surface. Without slurry seal, streets will require asphalt overlay on a more frequent basis, or streets can be allowed to deteriorate
into rough surfaces of broken rock, requiring total reconstruction of the roadway. Slurry seal is a more cost effective way to maintain City streets, with only selective application of chip seal or
overlay. For this plan to be successful, consideration must be given to the increasing cost of oil and sand, and the application cycle necessary for the amount of street surface area maintained by the
City. A Pavement System Maintenance Study was initiated in late 2012, and adjustments to future budgets and project locations and types may be necessary per the recommendation of the study.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the reconstruction of Hendy Avenue from Sunnyvale Avenue to Fair Oaks Avenue. This project has been included as part of City, County, and Regional long-range Traffic
and Transportation Plans for many years. It is part of the City’s Bicycle Capital Improvement Program, Santa Clara County’s Bicycle Expenditure Program, and the Valley Transportation Authority
’s (VTA) Bicycle Plan. The condition of the roadway in this area is exceptionally poor and has substandard sidewalks, bikeways, and lighting. Drainage facilities are also inadequate. This project
will reconstruct the entire roadway section to provide for all travel modes, upgrade lighting and streetscape, and provide additional on-street parking in the vicinity of the Northrop Grumman
facility.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The roadway facilities in this area are below standards. This project will bring the city street up to design standards which will improve access and safety. The anticipated construction start date
was the spring of 2013.

Fiscal Impact
The total project cost is $2.75 million, of which $2.05 million is funded by federal transportation grants distributed by the VTA. $431,975 is funded by dedicated local transportation grant matching
funds in the Traffic Mitigation subfund of the Capital Projects fund. The remaining $267,000 is funded from the Rate Stabilization Reserve in the Wastewater Fund for the storm drainage
component of the project.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is a partnership with the County Public Health Department Traffic Safe Communities Network (TSCN) to apply its successful model for school Transportation Demand Management
(TDM) programs at a large number of schools in Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale will provide half of the local funding match requirement to facilitate a Sunnyvale focus for the program. The TSCN
proposal will cover other schools in other areas as well, since as a County agency it must broadly target Santa Clara County residents. The other half of the local match requirement for the program
will be funded by the County of Santa Clara.
Total budget for the project is $1,120,000, with $560,000 in investment targeted for Sunnyvale. The County will be the lead agency to provide Safe Routes to School education and encouragement
activities at 80%, or 14, of the elementary and middle schools in the City of Sunnyvale. Activities may include walkability/bikeablity multi-disciplinary planning meetings at selected schools to
develop site specific plans to encourage safe walking/biking to school; classroom presentations and/or assemblies; parent traffic safety and encouragement activities such as workshops, family fun
bike nights, and walking school buses; and encouragement of activities like Walk and Bike to School Week. Training and support for school volunteers and staff would also be provided. City
Public Works and Public Safety staff will participate in planning meetings and activities on an in-kind basis.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
School traffic safety and congestion is an often-heard complaint. Schools have minimal resources to apply to traffic management. The City currently provides some traffic engineering, crossing
guard, and enforcement services to assist with traffic flow. This project will bring together all stakeholders to identify potentially successful strategies on a school-by-school basis and optimize the
application of available resources.

Fiscal Impact
This project provides a $64,780 local match from the City as part of $1.1 million in upgrades to Traffic Demand Management Systems. These funds will be passed through to the County of Santa
Clara. Sunnyvale staff will participate in the project on an in-kind basis.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City of Sunnyvale, in cooperation with the cities of Cupertino, Los Altos, and Mountain View, is seeking to conduct an alternatives analysis, technical feasibility study, public outreach effort,
and strategic implementation plan to assist the four cities in identifying a promising set of alternatives to complete a public multi-use bicycle/pedestrian trail through the entire Stevens Creek
Corridor. The document will be used for establishing a basis for a subsequent environmental document to identify a preferred alternative.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Stevens Creek Trail is a long-planned concept to connect the cities of Cupertino, Los Altos, Sunnyvale and Mountain View with a multi-use transportation and recreational facility. Over the
years, progress on completion of the trail concept has lacked coordination between the four cities, and a unified plan does not currently exist. Over the last two years, however, the communities
along the corridor have lobbied for completion of a plan. All cities have taken action to support completion of this plan, and a formal Stevens Creek Trail Policy and Technical Working Group has
been formed with representation from all jurisdictions. At this time, the cities and community groups are primed to work cooperatively to assess alternatives and determine a preferred alternative
for completion of the trail throughout the corridor.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded from Sense of Place Revenues. Identification of a preferred alternative could result in additional project development costs and ultimately project construction costs. These
costs are unknown at this time.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Staff has determined that a traffic signal at the intersection of Remington Drive and Bernardo Avenue may improve traffic operations and safety at this location. This project will construct a new
traffic signal and communications equipment for the purposes of improving safety through traffic control and traffic management.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
A technical analysis was performed of traffic conditions at this location. It was determined that traffic volumes, sight distance, and pedestrian conditions warrant the installation of a traffic signal.
Design completion is anticipated in FY 2012/13 and construction anticipated to be completed in FY 2013/14.

Fiscal Impact
This project is primarily funded by a $626,600 grant from the State of California Highway Safety Improvement Program. The grant requires a 14.3% local match, or $104,600, bringing the total
project budget to $731,200. The City's local match is funded by dedicated local matching funds in the Traffic Mitigation subfund of the Capital Projects fund. Future operating costs of $1,800 per
year will be required to maintain the traffic signal, starting in FY 2014/15.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is intended to provide annual funding for the replacement of damaged or raised sidewalks, curbs, and gutters throughout the City. The scope of work includes design, verification of
locations to be repaired or replaced, bidding and contracting the work, inspection, and closeout.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Demand for replacement work under this project has continued to grow. Over the last two fiscal years approximately 1,500 locations have been added to the replacement list, while available
funding has only resulted in 848 locations being repaired. If demand continues at the current pace, a total funding amount of $1,250,000 per year would be needed. The amount of funding proposed
is being increased by $500,000 per year for two years but other changes in service levels or additional funding will be needed in the long term. Staff will work to identify alternatives for the long
term with the capital project budget cycle that begins in fiscal year 2015-16.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Liliana Price

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the installation of bike lanes on Duane Avenue from Fair Oaks Avenue to Lawrence Expressway. The project will revise roadway geometry to provide bicycle lanes where
none currently exist.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Bicycle Opportunities Study identifies elimination of a travel lane in each direction as the optimal approach to providing bike lanes. Per City policy, staff would conduct a technical analysis to
affirm the design approach for providing bike lanes and carry out a public outreach effort. A recommendation for roadway reconfiguration would come before the City Council for a decision on the
ultimate configuration of the roadway. This project is currently the first priority from the Bicycle Capital Improvement Program. This project will also need to be coordinated with the Duane
Avenue/Britton Avenue Traffic Signal project and the pending re-paving of Duane Avenue in portions of the bike lane project area.

Fiscal Impact
The project is funded from a Transportation Development Act (TDA) grant. TDA Article 3 is a program that reimburses cities for the incurred costs of selected bicycle and pedestrian projects. No
local matching funds are required for Guarantee Fund projects.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for a pedestrian traffic signal at the northbound exit lane to Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road where it transitions to Mathilda Avenue at Talisman Drive. A large triangular island at
this intersection and a free right/exit lane for Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road creates a barrier for pedestrians crossing Mathilda at the Talisman intersection from completing a journey across the exit lane
to the Safeway/24 Hour Fitness shopping complex. Pedestrians must walk across the exit lane against high speed traffic, and there is no provision for the disabled or strollers. The project would
provide in-pavement and flashing beacons, advance warning devices, and curb ramps to allow pedestrians to actuate the signal and warn traffic to allow pedestrians to cross. The purpose of the
project is to facilitate walking, alleviate an inaccessible condition from the triangular island to the far side of Sunnyvale-Saratoga, and provide positive traffic control for vehicles to yield to
pedestrians.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This area has been the subject of citizen complaints for many years. Staff has documented high rates of yielding to pedestrians with the installation of pedestrian-only traffic signals. Staff believes
this application will solve a longstanding design flaw at a major City intersection and improve pedestrian and neighborhood access to a major destination. This is consistent with General Plan Land
Use and Transportation policies.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Gas Tax Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will cover the installation of four pay for parking systems, two to be installed in the North Mathilda Parking Overpass lot off California Street and two in the South Mathilda Overpass
lot. The systems will only accept credit/debit cards and a pay by cell phone method for payment. The pay meters will operate on solar power where feasible. Project costs include installation of
electrical services and conduit, concrete work, and appropriate signage and pavement markings to implement a pay for parking system in these two lots. In addition, costs include installation of
signage allowing only monthly parking passes during weekdays in the remaining 'commuter' lots on Evelyn Avenue, the South Mathilda Off Ramp lot, and along the south side of Hendy Avenue
between Sunnyvale and Taafe Avenue.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
On December 4, 2012, Sunnyvale City Council requested this project be developed for their consideration in FY 2013/14 along with a parking fee schedule to implement a new pay for parking
program for spaces most heavily used by Caltrain commuters. Revenues collected are to support the on-going maintenance of these City owned parking areas and cover additional costs for
enforcement.
The projected lifespan for the pay meters is 15 years. Funds budgeted in FY 2025/26 are for the replacement of the parking meter system equipment.

Fiscal Impact
Parking revenues will cover the annualized costs for this project as well as the operations and enforcement costs. Any remaining funds will be applied toward the on-going maintenance for the
parking areas.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The cities of Mountain View, Cupertino and Los Altos and Sunnyvale are currently coordinating plans for a trail to connect existing segments of the Stevens Creek Trail in Cupertino and Mountain
View. Options for alignment, type of access, feasibility, costs and timing are being developed. Upon completion of project planning, development, and environmental analysis, a trail connection
could be constructed, and it may be partially in Sunnyvale.
This project anticipates participation by the City of Sunnyvale in completion of a Stevens Creek Trail connection between Cupertino and Mountain View. The funds budgeted in this project
represent Sunnyvale's contribution to the regional effort, however, actual costs will not be known until the four cities agree upon a trail alignment and configuration.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Timing of this project will be dependent on a consensus decision among the four cities on a trail concept, and funding. A feasibility study is anticipated to be complete in 2014, with design and
environmental following in 2015 and 2016, and potential construction in 2017.

Fiscal Impact
This project is currently dependent on the realization of outside revenues. Staff will pursue grant funding at such time that a trail concept is identified. Staff is assuming a $500,000 construction cost
as a placeholder. The operating expenditures will cover the costs to maintain the Trail; this includes graffiti removal, enforcement, and repairs. Operating costs are based on recent experience with
the Calabazas Creek Trail.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide bicycle lanes on El Camino Real between Sunnyvale Avenue and Remington/Fair Oaks Avenues. The project consists of changing signs and painting thermoplastic
legends and striping in both directions of the roadway. The purpose of the project is to further expand the City's bikeway network in order to encourage bicycling and provide bicycle access where
no formal access exists today. The project also links three existing north-south bikeways on Remington Drive/Fair Oaks Avenue, Cezanne Drive, and Sunnyvale Avenue.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project represents the first bicycle lanes approved for installation on El Camino Real on the San Francisco Peninsula. El Camino Real is deemed to be the highest priority for bike lane
installation by the City's Bicycle Capital Improvement Program based on factors such as use, collision history, connectivity, and access to activity centers.

Fiscal Impact
The total cost to install striping, signs, and legends for bike lanes within existing right-of-way on El Camino Real from Sunnyvale Avenue to Remington Drive/Fair Oaks Avenue is $15,000. Grant
funds from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District Transportation Fund for Clean Air have been awarded and are sufficient to complete the project. There is no local match requirement for
this grant and there will be no increased cost to the City upon grant termination.

Jack Witthaus

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Staff Augmentation Project provides additional temporary and special staff resources over the next two years to accomplish transportation studies and reviews related to land development and
other demands including: the review of development site plans, review of traffic control plans, review and oversight of development traffic impact studies, and providing assistance with
neighborhood traffic studies such as stop sigh requests and traffic calming projects. The funding will be used for a combination of casual professional staff and on-call service contracts.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Department of Public Works Division of Transportation and Traffic is experiencing a high volume of demand for services related to the upturn in the economy. It is expected that this project
will help ensure that the Division's services are delivered in a timely and efficient manner, and that the backlog of work is reduced and ultimately eliminated. Many services delivered by the
Division of Transportation and Traffic are time sensitive. Particular areas of sensitivity are tasks related to the land development review process, such as transportation impact analysis preparation
(often a critical path item for development project timelines) and traffic control plan review and approval (required prior to issuance of many building permits). Augmenting current staffing with oncall planning and engineering services will help the Department of Public Works achieve and maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction during the busy cycle.

Fiscal Impact
Staff proposes a two year project budget at $125,000 per year. Based on staff’s experience with utilizing casual employees and on quoted rates from several local transportation planning and
engineering firms, staff estimates that over a two year period, the equivalent of 900 casual professional hours and 650 hours of outside on-call service could be used annually. Funds for these
services would come from the General Plan Budget Stabilization Fund and Development Enterprise Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This study would evaluate the reconfiguration of Wolfe Road roadway geometry and signalization between Homestead Road and Fremont Avenue. A set of alternative configuration concepts
would be identified and evaluated for traffic, parking and bicycling impacts which would include a 2-lane plus one reversible/two way left turn lane configuration, elimination of on-street parking to
provide additional lanes, and managed lanes. This would also evaluate existing and forecast traffic operations at the Wolfe Road/El Camino Real/Fremont Avenue intersections and identify and
assess alternatives for improved motor vehicle throughput, such as signal timing or operational changes, or the addition of through or turn lanes. This intersection complex features a unique
geometric layout and the intersection of three major arterial streets, including El Camino Real, which is the heaviest traveled arterial street in the City, and Wolfe Road, which is subject to
concentrated peak commute hour traffic.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
While the intersection complex has been studied in detail in the past, traffic studies have not been updated for 14 years. Changing traffic volumes and patterns, and potential land development at the
intersection have elicited interest on the part of the City Council members to update traffic studies of the intersecting complex. There is a perception that significant congestion and queuing occurs
in the peak commute hours. Also, concern has been expressed about the effects of Wolfe Road traffic on quality of life in the adjacent residential areas.
This study will provide information to decision makers and the community about whether there are opportunities to physically reconfigure Wolfe Road to improve traffic flow. The study will assess
feasibility, cost, and outline impacts of various alternatives.

Fiscal Impact
This study was approved during the FY 2014/15 Budget Adoption on June 24, 2014 as Budget Supplement #4; it will be funded by the General Fund Budget Stabilization Fund.
The study could result in the approval of new capital improvements, which could have substantial, yet currently unknown costs.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for the realignment of Wildwood Avenue and the construction of a new signalized intersection at Wildwood Avenue and Lawrence Expressway. The project has been
submitted for outside funding through the Valley Transportation Plan 2035 (VTP 2035), and is currently recommended for a funding allocation at some time over the 25 year lifetime of the Plan. It
is estimated that VTP 2035 would fund 80% of the project cost and the City would provide a 20% local match. Staff recommends that this project be placed on the unfunded projects list. The
estimated cost of the project is $4.3 million in FY 2016/17, based on conceptual engineering studies. Operating costs for signal electricity and maintenance would be incurred. FY 2016/17 funds are
for design and FY 2017/18 through FY 2019/20 funds are for construction.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for the Bernardo Avenue Caltrain Undercrossing. This project has been identified by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) as a Tier 1 Bicycle
Expenditure Program (BEP) project priority. It will eliminate a barrier for bicyclists traveling to the north of Sunnyvale on Bernardo Avenue by constructing an undercrossing of the Caltrain
railroad tracks. A specific funding source has not yet been identified and funding has not been applied for.

t
c
e
j
o

Per Council action on October 5, 2004 (RTC 04-350), a project update was submitted to VTA to reflect the updated cost and scope, and a deferred construction schedule of 2016 or beyond. As
described in the report to Council, a feasibility study was conducted, and a project update was completed for the 2004 VTA BEP Tier 1 Project Updates. This project will now need to be
coordinated with the pending Caltrain Modernization and California High Speed Train projects, which could significantly affect how the project is configured and funded. Staff recommends
maintaining this project on the unfunded projects list until a clearer understanding of the impact of Caltrain upgrades and high speed rail will have on the railroad corridor.

r

d
n
u
f

Project Evaluation and Analysis

The project would increase the service level for bicyclists living and/or working in Sunnyvale by significantly leveraging VTA and other grant funds. Cost estimates are based on the completed
2004 planning study. There likely would be ongoing electricity, landscaping, and walkway cleaning costs, which are estimated to be about $5,000 annually.

Fiscal Impact

This project has been placed on the unfunded list pending coordination with the California High Speed Train project. Estimates are conceptual-level only at this time and may be adjusted with
further refinement and selection of design options.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will construct a paved multi-use bicycle and pedestrian trail connecting the John W. Christian Greenbelt and the Lakewood Village neighborhood to Tasman Drive near the Fair Oaks
light rail station. The project will connect residential areas to parks, commercial facilities, and regional transit. This project was first identified in the Tasman/Fair Oaks Bicycle and Pedestrian
Circulation Plan. It is listed as a priority in the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Bicycle Expenditure Program and Bicycle Plan.

t
c
e
j
o

Project Evaluation and Analysis

The project concept was approved by Council as part of the Tasman/Fair Oaks Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation Plan. The project is consistent with goals for the Tasman/Fair Oaks area to
encourage bicycle, pedestrian, and transit use, and create an enhanced residential neighborhood with integrated services and recreation. Initial design investigations determined that the most
feasible and cost effective design would utilize Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) facilities. Due to an upcoming flood control project in the proposed trail alignment, the project will
need to be constructed after completion of the flood control improvements. The SCVWD will provide a design and offer the City an opportunity to have the Trail constructed along with the flood
control improvements as an additive alternate bid item.

f

Fiscal Impact

This project is currently unfunded. The costs for constructing a basic paved trail is estimated at $743,000. Staff is pursuing a grant to fund completion of the project, at such time that the Water
District's flood control improvements move forward. The project is a priority for funding through the Valley Transportation Authority’s Bicycle Expenditure Program.
This project is eligible for Sense of Place funds, which may be used as local matching funds for a grant. The project may be done in phases, with initial access improvements as an initial phase and
amenities such as benches, lighting, or landscaping as a later phase.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for future traffic calming projects. Traffic calming devices slow traffic and deter non-neighborhood traffic in residential areas of the City. This project provides for
the construction of neighborhood traffic calming devices as a result of studies and neighborhood consensus building. The proposed project budget will allow for installation of approximately one
comprehensive traffic calming project per year. The locations have not been determined, and the project budget is based on anticipated and historical demand. The operating cost budget is required
to pay for landscaping and maintenance costs, if necessary, related to the devices. These funds will be expended only at the conclusion of neighborhood-specific traffic calming studies per the
Council-adopted policy. These studies include a technical determination of need, a resident consensus-building process, and Council endorsement of study recommendations for construction of
traffic calming devices.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project implements gateway improvements identified in the El Camino Precise Plan, adopted by Council on January 23, 2007 (RTC 07-003). Gateways locations are identified near the east
and west City limits on El Camino Real. The goal of the El Camino Real Gateway Program is to enhance the City’s “front doors” by not only constructing improvements in the areas seen by most
people, but by doing so in a way that provides a unique identity and sense of place for each location and the edges of the City. The program will establish design standards for each location. The
overall design concept could be to provide towers, fountains, beacons, gateposts, pylons, or signs that become focal points to the City. The Program will require coordination and agreement with
Caltrans.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project would provide street right of way enhancements along El Camino Real in Sunnyvale, per the guidance of the Precise Plan for El Camino Real. Widened, improved sidewalks, enhanced
lighting, new and refreshed landscaping, bike lanes, and new pedestrian crossings would be elements of a project. The purpose of the project is to enhance the visual and physical experience of the
El Camino Real along the lines of a Grand Boulevard for pedestrians, cyclists, transit users, commercial business customers, and property investors.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

This project is included in the Precise Plan for El Camino Real, approved by Council in January, 2007. El Camino Real has been designated a Priority Development Area with a high potential for
alternative transportation-friendly housing and business development. This makes a streetscape project a good candidate for pending One Bay Area Grant funding. Improvements will require
California Department of Transportation approval and will follow a robust public outreach process to develop a design.

r

d

Fiscal Impact

This project is currently unfunded as it is dependent on securing outside grant funding, which would likely require a local match. If completed, this project may increase operating costs for
maintenance of lighting, signals and landscaping.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides circulation, bicycle and pedestrian improvements in the area defined by the Fair Oaks Junction Sense of Place Plan, located roughly near the intersections of Wolfe Road, Fair
Oaks Avenue, and Arques Avenue. The scope includes construction and reconstruction of sidewalks, construction of bike lanes and bike paths, provision of upgraded bus stops, placement of
neighborhood marker signs and monuments, and installation of bicycle parking. The purpose of the project is to enhance the quality of life for residents in the area, provide bicycle and pedestrian
improvements to encourage use of these modes, and to provide complete streets that serve all transportation modes.

j
o

Project Evaluation and Analysis

The Fair Oaks Junction plan was approved for development by the City Council in January, 2012, and the Final Plan was approved by the City Council in October 2012. The improvements called
for in the Plan would take place through development conditions, developer fees on redeveloped properties in the area, and securing of outside grants. The actual scope of specific construction
activities will be refined to coordinate with improvement needs and opportunities as the area redevelops.

Fiscal Impact

This project is currently unfunded. The project will occur as redevelopment of the area occurs, fees on redeveloped properties are realized, and outside grant funds are secured. There will be a fiscal
impact for operation and maintenance of new and improved bicycle and pedestrian facilities, such as bike lane and path re-striping and pavement maintenance, lighting, and sign repairs and
replacement.

Downtown
Sunnyvale Avenue Median from Iowa to Washington.
The Downtown Specific Plan calls for the construction
of a landscaped median on Sunnyvale Avenue, and this
project provides for the City's share of the construction
from Iowa Avenue to Washington Avenue. The City's
contribution is half the actual construction cost, not-to
exceed $750,000, and is funded from the proceeds of
the Town and Country land sale. The developer of the
Town Center Mall will construct the improvement, as
well as fund the remainder of the project. Timing of
this project is dependent upon the Town Center
redevelopment project, with funding budgeted so that
work can take place expeditiously as needed.

The revitalization of Downtown Sunnyvale is currently
underway with significant progress having been made
in a number of areas. The renewal of the area’s vitality
is a result of concentrated efforts and a commitment to
making Downtown a strong, viable city center.
Funding for the Downtown projects come from several
sources. These include the General Fund, a portion of
the proceeds from the sale of City land to the developer
of the Town and Country site, parking district
assessments, Traffic Impact Fees, and outside grants.

Major Downtown Projects

Town Center Traffic Signal Modifications.
Redevelopment of the Town Center Mall area requires
modification of traffic signals at the perimeter of the
site, and other modifications are required for
operational and aesthetic reasons. This project will
assure that work done by the Town Center developer is
complemented by non-development related upgrades to
provide complete, functional, aesthetically consistent
traffic signals. This project is also coincident with the
Town Center redevelopment project, and is budgeted so
that funds will be available when called for. This
project is funded by Downtown land sale funds.

Washington Avenue/Mathilda Avenue Intersection
Widening. This project is to widen the intersection at
Washington Avenue and Mathilda Avenue, creating an
additional westbound left turn lane. A portion of the
project has been completed, with the remainder
anticipated as downtown redevelopment continues. The
City share of this improvement is funded through a
Traffic Impact Fee collected from the developer of the
office project at Mathilda Avenue and Washington
Avenue.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides resources for supplemental staffing required by Public Works during the design review and construction of the Town Center redevelopment project. Included are contract
services for the following: a project coordinator to be the primary point of contact for all Public Works involvement in the project; a review engineer to assist current City Engineering staff in
review and response to design submittals and requested changes during construction; and backfill Transportation and Traffic Engineering support to complete work that will otherwise not be
accomplished due to staff being diverted to the Town Center redevelopment project. The backfill engineering support will allow City staff to focus on the Town Center redevelopment project issues
related to transportation modeling, including bicycle and pedestrian movement, warrants, signalization, signage, and streetscape design. The project coordinator will be the City’s contact with the
developer, contractor, and design engineer. This resource will be utilized as necessary when the Town Center redevelopment project continues and will remain involved until the project is
completed.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Without the addition of these resources, the Town Center redevelopment project would put an incredible strain upon Public Works staff. These resources are necessary to provide enough staff to
allow for careful, complete review of this important project without jeopardizing current program service levels.
This project will be funded by building fees and the utilities funds. The additional resources will only be involved and charged to the project as needed. The Town Center redevelopment project will
be constructed by a private developer and maintained by the private operator of the Town Center, therefore no operating costs are included.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund and the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the environmental remediation work at Town Center. The project was stalled following developer's default. Approximately $9.1M has been spent on investigation, remedial
design, monitoring wells, soil-vapor extraction, groundwater treatment, Remedial Action Plan, compliance, legal fees, and related costs. The Sunnyvale RDA share of these costs was tiered under
the former development agreement, resulting in the costs to the Agency of about $6.7 million. Under the revised Amended and Restated Disposition and Development and Owner Participation
Agreement (ADDOPA) the cost share will now be split 50/50. The budget in this project reflects the former RDA's share under the terms of the ADDOPA.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The soil and water remediation activities are ongoing and in accordance with the Remedial Action Plan approved by the Regional Water Quality Board. The City has proceeded with implementing
the accepted Action Plan.
This project is funded by former property tax increment funds and has been recognized as an enforceable obligation by the both the Successor Agency Oversight Board and the State Department of
Finance.

Connie Verceles

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project includes oversight and outreach to downtown businesses and residents about construction activities in the downtown, particularly redevelopment of Town Center.
The developer will be responsible for a significant portion of regular communications with businesses and with residents, paying costs for marketing the downtown during construction and
potentially an ambassador program. The construction mitigation plan for the mall portion of downtown construction was approved by the Redevelopment Agency on February 6, 2006 (RDA 07002). Mitigation plans for future projects (e.g., street improvements) are unknown at this time and the details will be determined through negotiations between businesses and the developer and
subject to City approvals. The proposed budget is to pay for the cost of City oversight of this process and additional outreach that the City Council and/or staff may feel is necessary to respond to
and address business and citizen concerns.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project serves residents and businesses directly impacted by construction activities in the downtown area through a variety of mitigation and promotional activities. It provides the resources for
staff to manage projects so that impacts are kept to a minimum.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Capital Improvement Projects Reserve in the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides the City's share for construction of a landscaped median on Sunnyvale Avenue from Iowa Avenue to Washington Avenue. This project is subject to the 2010 Amended and
Restated Disposition and Development and Owner Participation Agreement (ADDOPA). The agreement requires the developer of the Town Center to fund a portion of the cost to construct the
improvements, at a total estimated cost of $1,500,000. The City's cost contribution is half the actual construction cost, not-to-exceed $750,000.
The project is on hold pending recommencement of the Town Center redevelopment project, but funding will remain in place so that the project can resume work once the Town Center project gets
back underway.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Downtown Specific Plan calls for the construction of a landscaped median on Sunnyvale Avenue. Sidewalk and lighting improvements along Sunnyvale Avenue between Iowa and Evelyn
Avenue were performed as part of the Downtown Streetscape Project, completed in FY 2012/13.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Capital Improvement Projects Reserve in the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide for the installation of coordinated signs and gateway features that provide a unified and clear signage program to navigate to and within the downtown area. The purpose is
to highlight and demark the major entry points into the downtown area to identify this area as an important and distinctive part of the community. This project is subject to the 2010 Amended and
Restated Disposition and Development and Owner Participation Agreement (ADDOPA). It is on hold pending recommencement of the Town Center redevelopment project.
As the downtown area is revitalized and evolves with new development and more uses, this signage program will improve the aesthetics and promote economic vitality. This will be accomplished
with three related elements: (1) wayfinding signage within the downtown which requires the installation of signs that will direct the public to parking and major features within the downtown area;
(2) wayfinding signage to guide the public to the downtown, which requires directional signs to be installed along major roadways such as Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road, Mathilda Avenue and El
Camino Real; and, (3) gateway markers at key entry areas announcing the arrival into the downtown area. Three primary markers at Mathilda/Washington, Mathilda/El Camino Real, and
Sunnyvale/El Camino Real are at the boundaries to the downtown. A fourth gateway feature, located at the Mathilda/Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road split, would direct traffic toward downtown.
Gateways may be large pylons, arches, signs, or other similar features to catch the eyes of motorists signaling arrival to the downtown area. Once installed, the Wayfinding and Gateway items are
expected to last twenty years, with replacement needed due to wear and tear, graffiti, and damage.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
These signs and features have indirect financial benefit to the downtown area. Signage will help identify the area and its importance, and help potential patrons find their way to and within the
area. Higher patronage in the downtown is good for the economic vitality of the area, resulting in higher retail sales tax. A less costly program using standard green and white signs was considered
but found it would not provide additional identity to the downtown nor improve the overall aesthetic.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Capital Improvement Projects Reserve in the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the City's share of traffic signal modifications in the Town Center area. Portions of this work are necessitated by the redevelopment, while other elements are required to be
upgraded for operational and aesthetic reasons. This project is subject to the 2010 Amended and Restated Disposition and Development and Owner Participation Agreement (ADDOPA). It is on
hold pending recommencement of the Town Center redevelopment project.
The signals at the following intersections will be rebuilt by the developer pursuant to specific cost sharing agreements: Mathilda and Iowa; Mathilda and McKinley; Sunnyvale and Iowa; Sunnyvale
and Washington.
This project will assure that work done by the developer is complemented by non-development related upgrades to provide complete, functional, aesthetically-consistent traffic signals.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Redevelopment of the Town Center Mall area requires modification of traffic signals at the perimeter of the site.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Capital Improvement Projects Reserve in the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the City share to widen the intersection at Washington Avenue and Mathilda Avenue. This intersection requires the addition of a westbound left turn lane on Washington
Avenue to southbound Mathilda Avenue. Roadway widening for this improvement was constructed by the Town Center developer but intersection and traffic signal improvements were halted
when the developer defaulted. A portion of the intersection improvements were performed in FY 2012/13 as part of the pavement rehabilitation project. The total estimated cost of construction is
$998,000, with the City's share of the project not to exceed $336,814. Future work on this project is subject to the 2010 Amended and Restated Disposition and Development and Owner
Participation Agreement (ADDOPA). The project is on hold pending recommencement of the work by the Developer.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Environmental impact mitigation of downtown development requires the addition of a westbound left turn lane on Washington Avenue to maintain traffic levels of service.
The City share of this improvement is funded through a Traffic Impact Fee collected from the developer of the office project at Mathilda Avenue and Washington Avenue (Mozart Development
Corporation). Elements of this project have also been completed by the Town Center development at their cost.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Transportation Impact Fee subfund of the Capital Projects Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for major maintenance of the Downtown Parking District. Specifically, funds are planned to install concrete valley gutters as necessary and rehabilitate existing pavement in
the downtown parking lots at Frances Street and Evelyn Avenue (FY 2013/14), Sunnyvale Avenue and Evelyn Avenue (FY 2015/16), Carroll Street and Evelyn Avenue (FY 2015/16), and
McKinley Avenue and Carroll Street (FY 2015/16). Funding in subsequent years is for various maintenance activities including periodic asphalt patching, slurry seals, curb painting, sign
replacement, and re-striping as necessary.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will coincide with the completion of major improvements in the downtown area, including private development. Accomplishing this maintenance effort on the parking lots will improve
the aesthetics of the entire downtown.
Maintenance improvements of the downtown parking lots are funded entirely by the Downtown Parking District assessment paid by downtown businesses.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Parking District Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the completion of streetscape improvements for Downtown Block 18 (the northeast corner of Mathilda Avenue and Iowa Avenue). Currently, this site, containing the Bank
of the West, is within the Town Center Mall redevelopment area but is not part of the Town Center Mall redevelopment plan. This project includes upgrading of about 270 linear feet of new
decorative sidewalk and pavers, installation of acorn style street lights and tree grate standards to bring the block up to par with the rest of the redeveloped area.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

This project would complete the Block 18 area of the downtown. Not completing the project would leave a small area of a highly visible intersection without the new downtown streetscape
standard features.

No funding has been identified for the project. It may be more cost effective to have the developer complete the project at the time of the Town Center Mall redevelopment and reimburse the
developer for the expenses.

Housing
The City’s housing projects are targeted to achieve the
goals of the City’s Housing Chapter of the 2011
Consolidated General Plan. Housing projects are
funded through Housing Mitigation Fees and the City’s
allocation of the Federal HOME Grants.

Major Housing Projects
Housing Loans. The City offers First-Time Homebuyer
loans that help individuals with low and moderate
incomes. Other loan programs are offered by the City;
however, they are financed by CDBG and appear in
that section.
Armory Affordable Housing. Several current projects
have allocated funds for the construction of affordable
apartments at the former Armory site. MidPen Housing
and Charities Housing, both non-profit corporations,
will receive a total of $5.5 million and $4.9 million
respectively. These active projects will create housing
units at the City’s Armory Site for extremely-low and
very-low income households. Plans include providing
permanent affordable housing to those who would
otherwise be homeless. MidPen will use the funds to
develop family apartments while Charities Housing is
developing studio apartments.

Special
Suzanne Ise

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will fund the costs to pay for the City's share of conducting a bi-annual county-wide homeless count and survey. This homeless count and survey is a federally mandated initiative for
the County of Santa Clara. As agreed, each jurisdiction within the county shall contribute a pro-rata share of the cost to conduct the survey based on population. The estimated cost share for each
jurisdiction has been figured using the 2010 Census results. For the 2013 count, the City's pro-rata share is 16.76% of the countywide population.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The support of the city's fair share of the cost of the homeless survey provides substantial benefit to the homeless residents in Sunnyvale and throughout the county. It provides a key tool that
allows public service agencies access to federal grant dollars to support services to the homeless.

Fiscal Impact
The project is funded by the Housing Mitigation subfund of the combined Housing Fund. In order for the county to continue to receive McKinney-Vento funds, the county is mandated to conduct a
county-wide homeless count every two years.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $500,000 in Housing Mitigation funds for the First Time Homebuyer Program, to be used for down-payment assistance loans to eligible moderate-income households (at or
below 120% AMI, but above the HOME low-income "80%" AMI limit) for purchase of eligible homes in Sunnyvale. For further details, please refer to the current First Time Homebuyer Program
Guidelines.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will be an ongoing program offered by the Housing Division to assist moderate-income households in purchasing their first home. Given current turmoil in the housing market and
difficulties in securing conventional first mortgages at this time, the program will be considered a success if it is able to make several loans. Last fiscal year (2011/12), six loans were funded. Loan
volume is anticipated to grow in subsequent years, as the housing and financial markets stabilize.

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of $500,000 from the Housing Mitigation Fund in FY 2013/14. Of this amount, $150,000 has been earmarked for Habitat. The funds will be expended by
making deferred loans that will be paid back to the Housing Mitigation fund upon the occurrence of certain events that trigger the maturity date, such as sale or transfer of the home securing the
loan. It is anticipated that most of the loans will be paid back in full in lump sum payments approximately 5-12 years after the loan dates, although the loan term is 30 years. This use of Housing
Mitigation funds is consistent with City policy for use of the Housing Mitigation Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project would provide a contribution of $200,000 in Housing Mitigation funds to the Housing Trust Fund Silicon Valley (HTSV, formerly Housing Trust Fund of Santa Clara County) in FY
2014/15 for investment in City-approved housing projects located in Sunnyvale. Funds will be used for affordable multi-family rental housing construction, rehabilitation, and/or preservation,
and/or down-payment assistance programs for low and/or moderate income first-time buyers. The HTSV seeks seed monies from various public agencies in the county and other donors, and uses
these funds to seek matching funds from the State and federal governments, corporations, and other donors. From 2001 through the end of FY 2013/14, the City of Sunnyvale has contributed $2.55
million to the HTSV, which also resulted in a total HTSV investment of slightly over $2.8 million (including the City's contribution) in housing projects located in Sunnyvale to date.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will be considered completed at the end of FY 2014/15 when the City has provided its contribution to the HTSV, and the HTSV has provided its annual report to the City with details of
its use of the City contribution and any matching funds also invested in Sunnyvale housing projects. The project will be considered a success if the HTSV was able to match the City's contribution
and if it invested the entire amount in Sunnyvale housing projects pre-approved by the Housing Division.

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of $200,000 from the Housing Mitigation Fund in FY 2014/15. No additional fiscal impacts are identified. This use of Housing Mitigation Funds is
consistent with City policy and goals governing use of that fund and will leverage the city contribution with matching funds from the HTSV.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates an additional $278,182 to the County for FY 2014/15. Last year, this project allocated $215,310 in HOME funds to the Santa Clara County Mental Health Department to
administer a tenant-based rental assistance and security deposit assistance program for City residents experiencing or at imminent risk of homelessness. The City executed an agreement with the
County in December 2012. Prior funds in this project remain committed to the Housing Authority until all funds have been expended.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project addresses the priorities and goals described in the Consolidated Plan, specifically "Alleviation of Homelessness." According to the 2009 Santa Clara County Homeless Census, 7,086
individuals were found to be homeless in the County. Of this amount, 349 were Sunnyvale residents. Service providers reported an increase in clients seeking assistance as a result of the recession
and unemployment.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the HOME Fund and this use of HOME funds is consistent with federal regulations.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $4,050,000 in Housing Mitigation funds to Charities Housing Corporation, a non-profit corporation. Funds will be used for the predevelopment, entitlement and long-term
lease of the Armory Property, and the construction of rental housing all of which will be affordable to either homeless, very-low or extremely-low income households.
At the March 1, 2011 Local Redevelopment Authority meeting, staff was directed to initiate discussions with MidPen Housing Corporation and Charities Housing Development Corporation
regarding the City’s Armory site, located at 620 E. Maude Avenue, as a possible alternative site for affordable housing. Both affordable housing providers have determined that a joint project on
the Armory site may work.
On September 20, 2011 RTC 11-185, Council approved an Exclusive Negotiating Agreement between the City and MidPen Housing Corporation and Charities Housing Development Corporation
as the Developers of an Affordable Housing Project at 620 East Maude Avenue.
The Armory site is a prime site for affordable housing because it is centrally located with better access and services, compared to the Onizuka site which is isolated and lacks convenient services for
residents.
The proposed project includes 68 low-income family apartments by MidPen and 56 low-income efficiency studio units by Charities for a total of 124 dwelling units. Both developers have
submitted conceptual plans for a 124-unit project. Conceptually, the project would include at-grade parking and a podium level with up to three stories of residential above.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project addresses the priorities and goals described in the 2010-15 Consolidated Plan: Affordable Housing - Support affordable rental housing for lower-income households by providing
financial and/or technical assistance for rehabilitation, construction and/or preservation of affordable rental housing and/or site acquisition.

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of $4,050,000 from the Housing Mitigation Fund beginning in FY 2012/13. This use of Housing Mitigation funds is consistent with City policy for use of
the Housing Mitigation Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $880,000 in Housing Mitigation Loan funds to Habitat for Humanity to finance their acquisition of three City surplus properties. Habitat proposes to acquire all three homes
from the City, rehabilitate them to like-new condition, screen and select eligible lower-income home buyers, and sell the homes to those buyers with affordable long-term financing, under Habitat's
standard self-help housing model. The homes would be resale-restricted for at least thirty years. The entire project is estimated to take approximately six months from time of City approval.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will provide much-needed homeownership opportunities for lower-income home buyers. These homes will also help the City meet a portion of its regional housing needs allocation
(RHNA) for the 2009-2014 Housing Element Cycle. The project will also generate approximately $860k for improvement of parks in Sunnyvale.

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of $870,000 from the Housing Fund (70/100) which would be transferred to the Park Dedication Fund to serve as a bridge loan to Habitat to fund the
purchase of the homes, with an additional $10,000 appropriated from the Housing Fund for closing costs.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $75,000 in Housing Mitigation funds for consultant services to study raising and/or restructuring the Housing Mitigation Fee Program. The consultant will review the existing
housing mitigation fee structure, rate, and applicability, and consider possibly expanding it to a wider range of development types. In June of 2008 Council directed staff to review the Housing
Mitigation Fee Program to determine if the amount of the fee, and the indexing method, were appropriate and effective. At that time Council set the fee at $8.95 per square foot of new building area
subject to the fee (high intensity industrial development in excess of the allowable floor/area ratio [FAR] of the zoning district in which it is located); directed staff to adjust the fee annually based
on change in the CPI for that year; and required all projects approved after July 1, 2008 to pay the fee in effect at the time of payment.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project addresses the Housing Implementation program goal described in the Housing and Community Revitalization Sub-element, adopted in 2009: Support development of new housing
affordable to extremely low, very low and low income households; provide financial and regulatory assistance for new affordable housing development, using available funds; identify new sources
of funding; and evaluate expansion of the Housing Mitigation Fee.

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of $75,000 from the Housing Mitigation Fund beginning in FY 2013-14 for reimbursement of consultant services (Study Issue 09-11). This use of Housing
Mitigation funds is consistent with City policy for use of the Housing Mitigation Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $850,000 in HOME funds to Charities Housing Corporation, a non-profit corporation. Funds will be used for the development of 60 studio apartments at the former Armory
site that will benefit approximately 90 extremely-low and very low-income individuals that earn between 30%-50% of AMI, by providing permanent affordable housing to those who otherwise
would be homeless. Eighteen units will be set-aside for people exiting homelessness, of which 11 are participants of the County's Mental Health Services Act.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project addresses the priorities and goals described in the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, specifically, "Affordable Housing" and "Alleviation of Homelessness".

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of up to $850,000 from the HOME Fund (71/100), comprised of HOME CHDO set-asides from prior years. Use of these funds are consistent with federal
regulations governing use of HOME funds.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $1,000,000 in Housing Mitigation Loan funds to MP Morse Court Associates, a California Limited Partnership, of which the General Partner is Mid-Peninsula Coalition
Monte Vista Terrace Corporation, a wholly-controlled affiliate of MidPen Housing Corporation, a non-profit housing developer. Funds will support the rehabilitation of Morse Court, a 35-unit
property in Sunnyvale, located at 825 Morse Avenue. Built in 1983, the property has immediate exterior and interior capital work to support the long-term maintenance, energy efficiency, and
quality of life for extremely low-income families.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project addresses the priorities and goals described in the City's Housing and Community Revitalization Sub-element, specifically, "Housing Conservation and Maintenance" which provides
assistance to non-profits to rehabilitate aging multi-family rental properties.

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of $1,000,000 from the Housing Mitigation Fund beginning in FY 2014-15. This use of Housing Mitigation funds is consistent with city policy for use of
the Housing Mitigation Fund.

Water
Sunnyvale provides water services as a municipal
utility. Water service is one of the core services the City
provides.
The
City’s
Water
Fund
Enterprise
incorporates water demand and supply management,
ensuring safe and reliable supply and distribution,
maintaining financial stability, meeting quality
standards, providing fire protection, and providing
responsive customer service.

sufficient amount of water to equalize the daily demand
on the water system and to provide for peak demand.
They also provide emergency water back-up and fire
protection. Currently, staff is engaged in a detailed
evaluation of the tanks and wells to determine the best
operating and maintenance approach.
The costs to maintain water tanks and wells include
scheduled maintenance. There are projects that
specifically address this, including refurbishing,
cleaning, coating the interiors, upgrading electrical
motors and pumps, and exterior painting.

Major Water Projects
The current budget includes projects that are aimed at
maintaining the infrastructure for storing and
delivering water, as well as securing supplies for the
future. Particular focus is being placed on
rehabilitation and maintenance of water tanks, wells,
and water mains.

Water Mains. The current budget also contains
funding to replace the City’s aging water mains. The
City’s water system conveys water to customers
through 280 miles of pipes that vary in size from four
to thirty inches in diameter. Many of these pipes are
over fifty years old and have exceeded their estimated
useful lives. As a result, main breaks are becoming
more frequent. The project focuses on areas of the City
where soil conditions are most corrosive. It is assumed
that water line replacement will be an ongoing need for
the foreseeable future. To address this need, $4.8
million for water main replacements is included in the
twenty-year plan.

Water Tanks and Wells. The current budget contains
significant funding for infrastructure renovations for
the City’s potable water tanks and wells over the
twenty-year planning period. The City’s water system
has ten potable tanks, five of which have a five million
gallon capacity each. The remaining five smaller tanks
each hold 0.5 million gallons. Water tanks play an
important part in the City’s water supply and
distribution system. Their main purpose is to provide a

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the purchase and installation of radio read water meters, detector checks, vaults and backflow prevention devices for new development activities. Depending on meter size,
the equipment costs range between $150 and $8,000 each. Detector checks typically cost between $3,000 and $7,000, and backflow devices range from $300 to $10,000 each. The water meter
budget is set to $60,000, which is the average annual expenditure. The detector check and backflow prevention device portion is budgeted at $20,000 per year.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project allows staff to purchase equipment ahead of time, so that when new developments in the City are ready, the developer does not have to wait until we receive the equipment. This saves
the developer time (and money) and provides better customer service.
The funds used are recovered when the developer pays fees to the City, but staff needs to pay in advance to be able to provide swift service as needed. Equipment is purchased in bulk, which allows
the City to obtain a better price than if purchased separately, a few at a time. As the expense is ultimately paid by the developer, obtaining the best price helps keep developers interested in doing
business in Sunnyvale. This project is also needed to fulfill CA Code of Regulations Requirements (Title 17). If the project is not funded, the City will not be in compliance with legal requirements.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City’s existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) System monitors and controls the operation of its water supply and distribution system, and provides monitoring over
selected sanitary sewer, storm water, and recycled water facilities. Twenty-seven stations are monitored by the current SCADA system. These stations consist of one master station located at the
Corporation Yard, two storm pump stations, five sanitary sewer lift stations, six domestic water supply Hetch Hetchy (SFPUC) connections stations, six groundwater well stations, five domestic
water storage and pumping plants, one recycled water storage and pumping plant, and one pressure monitoring station. Phase I of the SCADA System replacement project, completed at 27 sites,
allows for remote control access and monitoring capabilities providing information on tank levels, pump/motor and well operations, valves open/closed status, and distribution water pressure and
flow.
The SCADA System Phase II includes selection of an upgraded software platform and programming to perform the software platform switchover, replacement of SCADA computer servers and
design of a new server room layout.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Continued operation of the SCADA system is critical to Water Division operations. The existing software platform is outdated and is no longer being updated and serviced. One of two existing
computer servers has failed and the backup server has reached the end of its lifespan. This project will provide the latest technology for SCADA monitoring and controls, and ensure that water
systems operations controlled via SCADA will continue. Operating expenses, maintenance and repairs are incorporated in the Water Supply and Distribution Program.
It is anticipated that the upgrades to the SCADA system (addition of items to be monitored and/or software upgrades) will be needed every ten years.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply & Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds the development of a computerized maintenance management system (MMS) for the City's utility enterprise assets in the water, sewer and storm drain systems. The MMS is an
important tool used to inventory and track maintenance of utilities, and to assist with cost projections and scheduling of long range infrastructure renovation and replacement. Information from this
system is used to update the funding plan for renovation and rehabilitation of the utility enterprise assets (Phase II of the Long-Range Infrastructure Plan), which is an important component of
planning and budgeting for the City's 20-Year Resource Allocation Plan and Capital Improvement Projects.
This project was recommended by the audit of the Water Program in FY 2004/05 and by a recent staffing study of the Department of Public Works. Purchase of the software is complete, but full
implementation including training, GIS integration, and installation of all preventive maintenance activities for the water and sewer utilities is currently underway. It is expected that the software
will have to be upgraded/replaced in 10 year cycles.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will provide a database of utility components, including water mains, sewer mains, valves, fire hydrants, clean outs, repairs, pipe size and type, and maintenance schedules. The City
has been using a service request product created in-house and upgraded over the past few years, but it does not include scheduling of maintenance and tracking of assets and does not meet all of the
department's needs.
Information provided by the new system will be used to estimate the functional life of the components and to update the funding plan for renovation and rehabilitation of the utility enterprise assets.
This product is important to the long-term maintenance of the utility systems.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The project provides funding for a leak detection program for the water distribution system, which is comprised of 318 miles of water mains that are less than 16-inch in diameter. The project also
provides funding to conduct a condition assessment of the City's 14 miles of transmission water lines that are 16-inch and larger. Transmission mains are critical as they supply large quantities of
water to meet Sunnyvale’s residential and commercial water supply needs. Approximately nine miles of City transmission pipes will be tested over the next three years using the latest ultrasonic
technology to assess the structural integrity of the larger size pipes. The assessment data will be used to prioritize the segments of pipes that require rehabilitation and replacement, and select the
appropriate course of action. The additional funding over the next three years provides for a condition assessment on four to five miles of the large pipes annually.
As recommended by the California Urban Water Conservation Council, and as identified in the City's adopted 2010 Urban Water Management Plan Demand Management Measure #3, leak
detection and system water audits are to be performed periodically by an outside contractor. Any water loss due to leakage, theft, faulty control systems, or any other reason represents revenue
losses to the City. Follow-up actions when leaks are located may include repairing leaky pipes and valves, replacing water mains, annual exercising of valves, and implementing corrosion control
procedures (i.e. cathodic protection program). The primary benefit of early leak detection is finding a leak before it becomes a larger problem, resulting in more water lost. Repair also keeps leaks
from deteriorating into large-scale problems that can lead to system failure, causing emergency conditions and compromising public safety. After the initial assessments, the cost of the leak
detection program will continue to be budgeted at $30,000 at three-year intervals.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is referenced in the City of Sunnyvale Water Utility Master Plan 4.9. It represents the most cost-efficient way to minimize water loss and ensure that potential transmission and
distribution infrastructure deficiencies are addressed in a timely manner to avoid loss of service and property damage.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Every five years, the Utilities Division in the Department of Finance performs a cost of service study of the water system to update and align the City's water rates with the costs associated with
providing water service. Staff works with a water finance specialist to develop a cost of service model and populate the model with current data. The study generates a cost of service for each
customer class and recommends adjustments to the City's rates and rate structure to ensure costs are recovered on an equitable basis from the different customer classes.
The most recent analysis was done in FY 2010/11. This project provides funding to hire a consultant that will support staff's effort to refresh the analysis every five years.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
State law (Proposition 218) requires that utility rates reflect the cost of providing service. Additionally, this study confirms that the revenues generated through rates are sufficient to cover the cost
of providing service.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Central Water Plant services Zone 1 of the City’s water supply system. The plant has been out of working order since 2007.
The Comprehensive Preliminary Design Study (projected completion date of FY 2012/13) will provide specific direction on design and construction elements for rehabilitation of the Central Water
Plant. It is anticipated that at a minimum, a new production well will need to be drilled, as the existing well is offset in alignment and non-functional. Also anticipated are an emergency generator,
pumps, motors, mechanical, electrical control, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)systems to support the new well. Minor tank repairs or removal may also be required. The
Comprehensive Preliminary Design study will provide further direction with respect to the existing tanks on the site.
Design is anticipated to commence in FY 2017/18, with construction following in FY 2018/19. Funding needs are conceptual at this point, and will be refined further after completion of the
Comprehensive Preliminary Design Study.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Central Water Plant is an important, but not critical, element of the City's water supply system. Existing buildings have deteriorated, and the equipment is currently out of service. This project
has been delayed pending completion of the Comprehensive Preliminary Design Study.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding to clean the interior of the City’s eleven water storage tanks without draining. This is accomplished by using commercial diving services to remove sediment on the
floors of the tanks using a vacuum system, and to perform minor touch-up corrosion repairs that can extend the existing coating life five to ten years.
Each tank has been placed on a seven year cleaning schedule. The San Lucar Tank is scheduled to be cleaned in FY 2013/14, FY 2020/21, and FY 2027/28. The two Wright Avenue tanks are
scheduled in FY 2018/19, FY 2025/26, and FY 2032/33. The three small Hamilton tanks are scheduled in FY 2019/20 and FY 2026/27. The two Mary-Carson storage tanks are currently scheduled
for refurbishment in a separate project and will be cleaned in FY 2027/28. The two small Central storage tanks are on hold awaiting recommendations from the Comprehensive Preliminary Design
Study.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Water tanks are critical to the storage and delivery of safe drinking water. The project will preserve the City's investment in its infrastructure and will help maintain water availability and quality.
California Department of Public Health recommends cleaning of tanks per American Water Works Association (AWWA) standards. Not funding this project could place the safety of drinking
water in jeopardy.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the replacement of pressure reducing valves, gate valves, control valves and vaults, and for the installation of magnetic meters at six (6) connections to the Hetch-Hetchy
water supply pipeline as referenced in the City's Water Utility Master Plan Chapters 7 and 8. Most valves to be replaced are 8" to 16" in diameter. The equipment is being replaced because of age
(40 to 50 years old) and to provide upgrades allowing each facility to be connected to the City's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.
The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (Hetch-Hetchy) connections are located at Lawrence, Fair Oaks, Borregas, Lockheed, Palomar, and Mary. Installations completed to date are
Borregas, Lawrence, Palomar, and Lockheed. Fair Oaks and Mary began in FY 2011/12 and are currently in progress.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The project not only replaces old components, but also updates them so that they can be remote-controlled by the SCADA system. This will increase system efficiency and help during emergencies,
by allowing staff to react more quickly to isolate possible problem points from the potable water system.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will replace all of the mechanical and electrical components of the Mary-Carson Water Plant, including associated pump house structure, access to and around the structure, and
emergency backup power to the plant. The Comprehensive Preliminary Design Study project will provide a conditions assessment and specific recommendations for items needing repair and/or
replacement associated with this water plant.
In advance of the conditions assessment, it is already known that the mechanical and electrical systems associated with the Mary-Carson Water Plant were built in 1966 and have exceeded their 40
year life expectancy.
As referenced in chapter 8 of the City's Water Utility Master Plan, equipment replacements and upgrades are necessary to maintain system integrity, conform to new Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) specifications, and to minimize the impact of emergency engine operation on local air quality.
Minor repairs have been done to the Mary-Carson roof. However, this building has structural and foundation problems associated with tree roots and will require re-roofing. This project is revised to
include roof and building repairs as part of the mechanical and electrical portion of the water plant renovation.
Associated site improvements are also required, such as paving and access to the structure housing the mechanical and electrical components which are non-compliant with standards and in need of
replacement.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Improvements associated with the tanks, tank anchorage, and overflow moat will be addressed in a separate project, 830170, Refurbishment of Water Tanks.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for a portable emergency stand-by generator, electrical connections, and electrical motor control upgrades suitable for a residential neighborhood. This project also provides for
modifications to the existing electrical panel and minor site improvements to facilitate the portable generator's access to the well site location.
An emergency standby generator is needed at this well site to provide electrical power in the event of a long-term power outage. During critical emergency situations, water supply from HetchHetchy or the Santa Clara Valley Water District may be interrupted. In these instances, additional water supply and pressure from this well will be needed. The portable generator will be used only
during emergency situations. This would eliminate the need for a permanent enclosure housed in a park and residential area. Staff will work with the neighborhood affected by the presence of the
generator.
This project will enable the Ortega Well to be an effective water source in the event of an emergency.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is referenced in the City's Water Utility Master Plan. The only alternative is not to fund this project and leave the well with no electrical power during a power outage. This would affect
the City's ability to provide water to its customers at a time when it might be needed for emergency situations.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will replace, repair and evaluate the City's 60 existing pressure-reducing valves (PRVs). In addition, this project will connect the PRVs to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) system to allow City staff to remotely monitor and control water system pressures, turn valves on and off quickly in emergencies, and in general, better manage and maintain water
quality. PRVs are an integral part of the water distribution system as they maintain balanced water pressure between the City's three pressure zones.
Annual budgeted amounts are based on the historical average cost of repairing two PRVs per year. Actual costs will vary depending upon the size of the valve and whether the work involves total
replacement or minor repair. As part of the annual evaluations, staff will determine whether each PRV is essential to the overall system. If certain PRVs are determined to be unnecessary, staff will
remove them from the system.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain existing essential infrastructure of the Water Utility and is referenced in the City's Water Utility Master Plan 2.1.2. Properly functioning PRVs help reduce the
number of main breaks caused by high pressure and also provide additional fire protection.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will replace all the mechanical and electrical components of the Wolfe-Evelyn Water Plant, including the associated pump house structure and access to and around the structure. This
project will also provide emergency backup power to the plant. The Comprehensive Preliminary Design Study project will provide conditions assessment and recommendations for specific items for
repair and/or replacement associated with this water plant.
The mechanical and electrical systems associated with the Wolfe-Evelyn Water Plant were built in 1959 and are now beyond their 40 year life expectancy. The associated site improvements, such as
paving and access to the structure housing the mechanical and electrical components, are non-compliant with standards, and are in need of replacement. Roof and building repairs will also be
required as a part of the mechanical and electrical plant renovation work. Other significant improvements associated with the tanks, tank anchorage and overflow moat, will be addressed in a
separate project, 830170, Refurbishment of Water Tanks.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Wolfe-Evelyn Plant is an integral part of maintaining the municipal water system. It has exceeded its useful life and current equipment is not reliable. In addition, due to the age of the system,
locating replacement parts has been costly and difficult.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides ongoing replacement of aged and damaged water lines. There are over 300 miles of underground water transmission and distribution lines in the City, varying from 4” to 30” in
diameter, with many different material compositions (Asbestos Concrete, Cast Iron, Ductile Iron, Steel Pipe and PVC). This project upgrades the water system by standardizing materials used (PVC
C-900 with tracer line, new valves, and fire hydrants).
The project also upgrades pipes and fittings for seismic stability, thus minimizing the need for costly emergency response activities caused by pipe breaks. Ongoing scheduled water line
replacement is not only more cost-efficient than corrective or emergency repairs, but also less disruptive to residents. The Water Distribution Master Plan recommends replacement of lines based
upon deterioration, particularly those subject to corrosion, and recommends that smaller diameter lines be replaced with minimum of an 8" diameter for fire suppression flow, and to reduce velocity
and associated excess wear.
There were two Water Line Replacement projects in FY 2012/13. The locations for these projects were determined by the 2010 Water Utility Master Plan and by leak detection analysis. The first
project replaced approximately 21,000 LF of water main at various locations in the central portion of the City. The construction ocurred in 2012/2013. The second project included replacing
approximately 16,000 LF of water main and relining approximately 20,000 LF of transmission lines at various locations of the City.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The integrity of the City's water supply system is critical to protect public health, enhance sanitation, and provide fire suppression. Currently, many portions of the water system have exceeded their
estimated life expectancy or deteriorated over time because of chemical reaction with certain soils. Structural failure of a line can result in failure of the pipe to deliver water, subsequently
endangering a neighborhood or degrading the pressure and supply of the entire system.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will replace five regulating valves, three electric motors (with a booster pump and a motor control center for each motor), and a lighting electrical sub-panel at the Wright Avenue Water
Plant. These items will provide better control of the water system. During power failure, a back-up generator will provide electricity to the whole station rather than just one pump as the existing
system does. The most urgent item of the project is the installation of the control valve and magnetic meter to allow Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project was referenced in the City's Water Utility Master Plan Chapter 8. The alternative to this project would be to leave the plant without a connection to the SCADA system, which would
slow down any response to emergencies in the plant. In case of an emergency situation in which Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) cannot provide water, the City would have to send a
crew with a special truck to turn off the 30" valve connecting us to SCVWD. The control valve will give us the ability to remotely shut down the valve from the SCADA operations room.

Fiscal Impact

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for a periodic assessment of the City's water transmission and distribution system. A water model for the delivery system was completed in FY 2006/07 under a separate capital
project. The current project, which was last completed in FY 2010/11, will describe existing City resources for the production and distribution of water and present a plan for construction of new
infrastructure and facilities. This project is one of the steps in the Long Range Infrastructure Plan and will recommend improvements and suggest a funding strategy.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City provides water supply services to residents and businesses within the City. This assessment is needed to identify the capital projects that will be necessary to replace aging infrastructure
and to identify any upgrades of the water lines that may be needed as a result of future developments. This is a best management practice for ensuring the water service system can continue to
provide reliable service.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
For several years the City has been installing radio read meters as part of its regular meter replacement program. To date, almost 100% of the City's commercial meters and 30% of the City's
residential meters have been converted. The result of this effort has been that almost half of total reads each year are now done remotely through drive-by radio read technology.
This project supplements and therefore accelerates automation through the City's regular meter replacement program, converting an additional 1,500 meters per year. The project will target close to
complete reading routes that are already almost fully converted. The focus will then shift to areas of the City that are less efficient to read, such as areas on the south end of Sunnyvale where lot
sizes are large and therefore meters are farther apart.
This project will also provide funding for the implementation of next generation technology where networks are used. New technology includes more granular reading and use data, customer alerts,
and reports. Further, the new technology does not require staff to drive or visit sites to obtain readings.
At the conclusion of the project, it is anticipated that meter reading currently being done by three staff will be achieved by fewer than two. Current meter reading staffing resources will then be
shifted to supplement routine meter maintenance tasks (such as clearing vegetation, replacing dirty registers, uncovering buried meters, etc) currently done by meter shop personnel. This will allow
meter shop personnel to focus on more technical functions such as backflow testing, meter maintenance, and billing troubleshooting and auditing.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City of Sunnyvale currently reads the majority of the water meters in the city manually. There are approximately 28,000 meters, each of which is read at least six times a year. Manual meter
reading is out of date, inaccurate, and inefficient. Radio read meters use radio frequency waves to transmit data from the meter to the receiving device. Radio read meters provide three advantages:
(1) meters can be read more quickly from a mobile or fixed location (truck or tower); (2) reads are more accurate; and (3) meter readers are not exposed to the dangers of reading meters. This
project also provides the City flexibility through more accurate and timely reading and consumption data that can be used to shift billing cycles, promote conservation, and provide customers with
detailed information about their water use.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Raynor Well is a high production well capable of providing an average flow of 1,800 gallons per minute with an emergency backup generator on site. The pump and motor failed in November 2009.
The mechanical failure of these components provides an opportunity to test the well and to design a new well facility that will provide a reliable source of water for the future. This project will
provide funding to design a new well facility, including well rehabilitation and a new pump/motor and electrical control panel.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The project will help ensure that the well will continue to provide water for Sunnyvale when disruption of water delivery occurs from its regular water providers (Santa Clara Valley Water District
and San Francisco Public Utilities Commission) and during peak demand periods to maintain adequate system pressure.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide funding to rehabilitate the City's Recycled Water (RW) pipeline cathodic protection system per the conditions assessment report commissioned in 2007. The scope of work
includes validation of the original report's findings and design of an adequate cathodic protection system for the recycled water system.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
If cathodic protection is not repaired/replaced/upgraded, the City's RW distribution system will ultimately start to see increases in main breaks due to pipe failure. This has occurred already at
Baylands Park. Installation of cathodic protection is the first defense in the protection of the City's recycled water infrastructure.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City operates a recycled water production and distribution system that serves primarily landscape irrigation demands in the City's commercial and industrial area. The distribution system
consists of 17.3 miles of reclaimed water pipelines that are the result of five projects designed and constructed between 1992 and 2000.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
In 2000, the City completed a Recycled Water Master Plan that was designed to maximize the delivery of recycled water to customers within the service area. An update of the Recycled Water
Master Plan is necessary to evaluate expansion options, including market analysis, treatment scenarios, and required storage and distribution system.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Following the development of the City-wide computer water model in 2006, the City completed the Water Utility Master Plan (WUMP) in 2010. This document addressed potable water demand
projections through 2033; condition assessments; evaluations with prioritized recommendations for long range infrastructure improvement planning and asset management; City-wide hydraulic
pressure analysis; and, identification of system deficiencies.
Since the completion of the WUMP, the City has refined its long-term potable water demand projections, as required by the State of California, as part of the Urban Water Management Plan
(completed in 2011). Staff has also identified the need for a preliminary design study to evaluate and possibly rehabilitate various groundwater production facilities, including the Central Water
Plant (currently out of service) and the Serra and Westmoor groundwater wells (both functioning but not to current City production standards).

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The scope of work for design study will include a system operations and assessment, an energy efficiency analysis, and an update to the City's bid specifications and standard guidelines.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will comprehensively refurbish two 5.0 MG storage tanks at Mary-Carson and one 5.0 MG storage tank at Wolfe-Evelyn, in accordance with a complete structural and coating
evaluation study performed in 2004 that found the tanks to be in poor condition. Comprehensive tank refurbishment includes: new interior coatings, cathodic protection update, seismic restrainers
for tank foundations, flex coupling adapters at tank/water line interface, repairs to the overfloat moat, and other necessary improvements.
Refurbishing the tanks is more cost-efficient than replacement, since the cost of replacing one tank exceeds $5 million. Proper coating and normal schedule of maintenance should keep the tanks in
useable condition for up to 40 years. The water tanks located at Mary-Carson and Wolfe-Evelyn hold 100% of the water provided by San Francisco PUC, and represent approximately 45% of
current City potable water-storage capacity.
Refurbishment of Mary-Carson will commence in FY 2017/18, and Wolfe-Evelyn will begin in FY 2023/24. The work will need to be completed in such a manner that only one water tank is out of
commission at any one time, and construction activity is limited to the winter months when water demand is lowest.
As water tanks are refurbished, they are placed into a periodic maintenance program for interior and exterior maintenance activities. Other water tanks at the Hamilton Water Plant, Wright Avenue
Water Plant, Central Plant, and San Lucar Recycled Water Plant are also included in this 10-year program for periodic interior/exterior maintenance work.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This is a critical project to comply with California Department of Public Health requirements for water tanks. Additionally, it is referenced in current City of Sunnyvale Water Utility Master Plan
Chapter 8.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) is a document produced every five years through a program administered by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). Water suppliers
that proved either 3,000 acre feet (AF) of water per year or serve 3,000 or more water service connections is required to produce a UWMP for review by DWR. The UWMP is intended to be a
planning document that will assess the reliability of an agency's water resources over a 20-year planning horizon. Water supplies and demands are accounted for, as are expected population
increases and development. The UWMP is approved by a resolution of the City Council and is the 2015 update to the UWMP is due to DWR by December 31, 2015 unless an extension to June 30
of the following year is granted, as has been the case before.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Production of an update to the UWMP every five years is a regulatory requirement. DWR reviews and certifies the plans for each water supplying agency. DWR must certify that each agency's
UWMP update complies with the Urban Water Management Planning Act (Division 6, Part 2.6 of the California Water Code, sections 10610-10656. Consultants will be hired to assist in the
production of the UWMP update. The assistance of consultants assures that all legal and regulatory requirements are being met and that the supply and demand calculations are done accurately.
Staff time will be required to review Sunnyvale-specific portions of the UWMP and to administer the process of getting Council approval by the aforementioned deadline.

Fiscal Impact
Estimated costs for the production of the UWMP by contracted consultants are $52,695, which include multiple updates over twenty years. In addition to the consultant costs, staff time will be
required to review Sunnyvale-specific portions of the plan and administer the process of getting Council approval ahead of the DWR deadline.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is to improve the reliability and operation of the Mary Avenue Transmission Main. The large-diameter line (16” to 24”) is designed to transport water at high pressure from the Mary
Carson Plant in Pressure Zone I to the Wright Ave. Plant and Pressure Zone III. Along the route of the transmission main there are four connections to the distribution system that have zone gate
valves that are kept closed to avoid creating excessively high pressures in the distribution lines that could affect individual homes.

t
c
e
j
o

The project would install 2 pressure-regulating valves along the transmission main: one 12" valve at El Camino Real, and one 8" valve at Olive Ave.

This project is currently on hold and waiting for the outcome of Comprehensive Preliminary Design Study, which will recommend whether this project is needed or not. The proposed FY 2016/17
budget is an estimated cost and the improvements can be performed by ESD water staff.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

This project would protect the water distribution system from high pressures that might cause pipe breaks, at the same time improving city-wide service since water flow capacity and pressure
would improve. Reliability of the system would be increased by allowing for remote monitoring and operation, including switching between straight transmission to the higher pressure zone (Zone
III), and supplemental supply to Zones I and II. The increase in pressure would also help fire protection service.

Fiscal Impact

This project is currently unfunded and will be re-evaluated as part of the Water Utility Master Plan.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide funding for the design and construction of recycled water main lines throughout the City providing critical "loops" in the distribution system.
There are several locations for a line connecting the east and west mains, looping the system and providing a more direct route from the San Lucar storage and WPCP pumping facilities to
Sunnyvale and beyond. The ability to loop the system connection would help meet the demands of recycled water for the future.

t
c
e
j
o

This would improve the reliability of the recycled water system and provide improved pressure throughout the system. It would also enable us to minimize service outages and would afford us an
opportunity to extend laterals to serve additional City facilities, parks, school playgrounds, and Homeowners Association complexes in the near future.

Funds in FY 2015/16 are for the design and funds in FY 2016/17 are for the construction of the project. The project is dependent on recommendations from the Recycled Water Master Plan.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

The project will increase reliability of recycled water service to customers, and create new opportunities to sell recycled water to new customers. This project is in accordance with the City's
Recycled Water Master Plan.

Fiscal Impact

This project maybe eligible for grant funding from the Santa Clara Valley Water District. The project is unfunded pending identification of outside revenue sources.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The current recycled water distribution system has a single storage tank, with a working volume of about 1.5 million gallons. As the recycled water system demand has grown (summer demands
frequently exceed 2 million gallons per day) the need for additional storage capacity has escalated. The system needs additional storage capacity in the form of multiple satellite systems at reuse
sites or a single tank in the 2-5 million gallon size range. Operational considerations associated with producing recycled water at the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) and limitations of the
existing storage and pumping facilities make the construction of additional storage capacity a virtual prerequisite for any significant growth in the recycled water supply.

t
c
e
j
o

The use of recycled water benefits the local community and the region as a whole by reducing demand on potable water supplies, and by providing an additional "drought-resistant" supply of water
for irrigation and other approved uses. Water recycling also reduces the discharge of certain pollutants to the fragile San Francisco Bay environment, and is therefore strongly supported by the State
and Regional Water Boards.

r
P
d
e
d
n
u
f

Costs for new facilities will depend on the size, siting and other considerations, which have not yet been defined. Placeholder estimates are $1.2-$1.5 per gallon of storage (with accompanying
pumping facilities, but excluding land costs).

Project Evaluation and Analysis

Additional recycled water storage and pumping facilities will enhance prospects for coordinating with neighboring agencies on joint recycled water projects, such as coordination with the City of
Mountain View for service of recycled water to the NASA-Ames complex.
Specific local benefits of additional storage include: (1) the ability to supply recycled water to new customers in Sunnyvale and neighboring communities; (2) increased system reliability; and (3)
reduced production costs (recycled water is currently produced in batch mode, which involves significant "ramp up" time). Increased storage would allow for the reduction of the percentage of
overall production time spent in ramp-up mode.

Fiscal Impact

n
U

This project is currently unfunded. Potential funding sources include the City of Sunnyvale with potential support from the Santa Clara Valley Water District, or other sources yet to be identified.
Operating and maintenance costs would be funded through revenues generated from the sale of recycled water.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for the City's share of design and construction costs for expanding the City's recycled water interconnections. These interconnections will ensure increased pressure
and reliability, and will provide an additional source of recycled water during periods of peak demand. This project adds connections at multiple locations to the City of Sunnyvale's recycled water
main. Each section will include gate valves and hydrants to be used for street sweeping and sewer main line flushing.

t
c
e
j
o

There are currently three locations being evaluated by this project. All of these connections are on the City’s west boundary line connecting to the City of Sunnyvale’s 16” West transmission main.
The first site, located near Highway 101, would require approximately 3,168 lineal feet of 8” to 12” C-900 FPVC pipe, and would connect to West Clyde Avenue in Mountain View. The second
connection is located near Maude and Highway 237. This site would require approximately 1,320 lineal feet of 8” C-900 FPVC pipe to connect to East Clyde Avenue.

r
P
d
e
d
n
u
f

The third site would require approximately 6,600 lineal feet of 12” C-900 FPVC pipe to connect Moffett Field to City of Sunnyvale’s West transmission main. This would provide recycled water for
use at Moffett Field /NASA Research Center, and for use in landscape irrigation. It would also inter-connect with Mountain View/Palo Alto and potentially add a storage and pumping facility.
The project budget represents the City of Sunnyvale's share of the total cost. The cost estimates are based on the 2000 Recycled Water Master Plan. Design is scheduled for FY 2014/15, with
construction beginning in FY 2015/16.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

This project ensures additional recycled water during peak demand and plant testing. It also eliminates the need to use SFPUC potable water as a back-up to the recycled water system.
The City is currently limited in its ability to utilize recycled water as another viable water source. Connecting to the Mountain View system will allow the City to acquire additional recycled water
customers near our boundaries. In addition, this project allows the City to have an uninterrupted recycled water source which eliminates the need to use more expensive San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission (SFPUC) potable drinking water as a back-up.

Fiscal Impact

Landfill. Five landfill-related projects are included in
the current projects budget. They include the
replacement of landfill gas flare and blowers, the City’s
response to new federal regulations on landfill gas
systems, aerial mapping of the landfill, monitoring the
landfill’s “Constituents of Concern”, and a project to
make improvements to reduce erosion on the landfill
surface.

The Solid Waste and SMaRT Station Long-Term
Financial Plans include projects related to the
maintenance and operation of the City’s solid waste
system. Most notable is the equipment replacement
schedule for the SMaRT Station. This replacement plan
is financed by the cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain View,
and Palo Alto in proportion to their original investment
in the SMaRT Station.

Solid Waste Cost of Service Study. The Solid Waste
Division of the Environmental Services Department
plans to perform a cost of service study on the solid
waste collection and disposal system every five years
over the course of the long-term plan. The next study is
planned for FY 2017/18.

Major Solid Waste Projects
The current budget includes funding for Solid Waste
projects related to the SMaRT Station and the landfill.
Major projects include:
SMaRT
Station
Equipment
Replacement
&
Operations. There are five projects that relate to the
replacement of equipment and the operating contract
for the SMaRT Station. These projects include
Sunnyvale’s contribution to financing the equipment
replacement plan, the actual replacement of the
equipment, and projects for both the total cost and
Sunnyvale’s share of the cost of preparing and bidding
the contract for operating the SMaRT station. The fifth
project is for the eventual replacement of the SMaRT
Station facility.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT) Station Capital Replacement Fund equipment replacement reserve is funded by Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, and Mountain View, at 55.28%,
21.27% and 23.45% of the total contributions, respectively. This project reflects Sunnyvale's 55.28% share of contributions to the replacement fund. A related project, 811250, SMaRT Station
Equipment Replacement, shows actual expenditures as opposed to Sunnyvale's annual dollar contribution. The Solid Waste Contract Administrator annually updates the replacement schedule,
costs, and contribution amounts to reflect anticipated expenses, based on the City's experience since the SMaRT Station opened in 1993.
Periodic equipment replacement is necessary to ensure cost-effective operations. The replacement reserve funded by this project addresses replacement cost of about three dozen components of the
SMaRT Station equipment and facilities, each with its own useful life. Major elements of equipment replacement work scheduled for FY 2013/14 include the wood/yard waste shredder, office
building HVAC, truck scale components, hazardous materials shed and pavement repairs.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The timing and approach to replacement of various equipment items is re-evaluated yearly with the goal of pursuing the most cost-effective path (repair, replacement, refurbishing, or removal) for
each project component.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Solid Waste Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project replaces and maintains City-owned equipment and facilities at the Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT) Station. The SmaRT Station is operated for the cities of
Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and Palo Alto under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that expires in 2021. This project is funded by payments to the SMaRT Station Replacement Fund made
by Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and Mountain View, which pay 55.28%, 21.27% and 23.45% of the total costs. Actual expenditures differ from revenues year to year as fund reserves are used to normalize
contributions by each of the partner cities. A separate project, 801351, is funded by the Solid Waste Fund and represents Sunnyvale's contribution to this project.
Periodic equipment replacement is necessary to ensure cost-effective operations. This project funds replacement of about three dozen components of the SMaRT Station equipment and facilities,
each with its own useful life. Major elements of equipment replacement work scheduled for FY 2013/14 include the wood/yard waste shredder, office building HVAC, truck scale components,

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds development, issuance, and evaluation of a Request for Proposals (RFP) to operate the City's Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT) Station. Selection of an
operator for the contract beginning in January 2008 was made in FY 2006/07. The selection process had a total cost of $134,090 during FY 2005/06 and FY 2006/07. The contract term is for seven
years of operation at a total cost of $70-$80 million. Project costs include funds for another RFP process beginning in FY 2012/13 and every seven years thereafter in advance of the expiration of
the existing contract.
The SMaRT Station Operating Fund will be reimbursed for the project cost by Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and Mountain View, based on their proportions of solid waste delivered to the SMaRT Station
in the year the expenditures occur. A separate project funds Sunnyvale's contribution. For purposes of budgeting, Palo Alto (or another city replacing Palo Alto) is assumed to continue in its current
role throughout the 20-year plan. The proposed budget is based on the expenditure history of the most recent RFP.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
In lieu of a competitive process, an extension could be negotiated. However, analysis of previous extension proposals has shown that pricing and/or terms have not been as favorable to the City
compared to funding this project and conducting a competitive procurement. Benefits of competitive procurement include an unfettered opportunity to modify contract terms in response to changes
in law, technology, and market conditions. Business and operational impacts include refuse collection, transfer and disposal, recyclable materials collection, processing and marketing, and the
equivalent services that the City provides to Mountain View and Palo Alto per the SMaRT Memorandum of Understanding. If this project is not funded, the City will not be able to pay for a
competitive procurement.
No operating costs result from an RFP process, but operating savings will likely result from use of a competitive process rather than a sole source procurement or a contract extension.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the SMaRT Station Operating Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds the City's contribution to the SMaRT Station Operations Fund for its share of the cost of development, issuance, and evaluation of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for SMaRT
Station operation. A related project, 821170, SMaRT Station Operations Contract RFP, funds the total expenditure as opposed to Sunnyvale's dollar contribution. The cost of the RFP project is
shared among the three cities participating in SMaRT Station funding: Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and Palo Alto. Sunnyvale's share is based on the three cities' proportionate shares of garbage tons
delivered to the SMaRT Station each year.
Selection of an operator for the contract beginning in January 2008 was made in FY 2006/07. The selection process had a total cost of $134,090 during FYs 2005/06 and 2006/07. The contract term
is for seven years of operation at a total cost of $70-80 million. The proposed budget in this project assumes that there will be another RFP process beginning in FY 2012/13 and one every seven
years thereafter.
This project is funded by the City's Solid Waste Management Fund, which in turn is funded by Solid Waste Fees.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
In lieu of a competitive process, an extension could be negotiated with the incumbent contractor. However, analysis of previous extension proposals has shown that pricing and/or terms have not
been favorable to the City when compared to funding this project and conducting a competitive procurement. Benefits of competitive procurement include an unfettered opportunity to modify the
contract terms in response to changes in law, technology, and market conditions. Business and operational project impacts include refuse collection, transfer and disposal, recyclable materials
collection, processing and marketing, and the equivalent services that the City provides to Mountain View and Palo Alto per the SMaRT MOU. If this project is not funded, the City will not be able
to pay for a competitive procurement for the operations contract.
For purposes of budgeting, Palo Alto (or another city replacing Palo Alto) is assumed to continue in its current role throughout the 20-year plan.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Solid Waste Division plans to perform a cost of service (COS) study on the solid waste collection and disposal system every five years. This project may be moved forward or delayed based on
external circumstances such as legal issues or industry trends. This helps to ensure that costs are properly allocated among the various customer classes, and that costs are being fully recovered in
rates. The COS study was last done in FY 2012/13. The budget anticipates future studies in FY 2017/18 and at five year intervals thereafter. The study includes evaluation of current services and
disposal costs, time and motion data, contractor payment and city costs, and distributes costs based on the tonnage generated by each customer sector.
The City began setting rates based on cost of service after Council approval of the cost of service policy in 1993. As cost centers change over time, rates tend to drift away from cost of service. This
can harm the cost-effectiveness of operations, as customers get economic signals that cause them to choose services in ways that increase costs more than revenues. Thus, rates must be periodically
reviewed. The project cost estimate is based on historical costs.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
City policy requires that the rates be periodically restructured in a way that “equitably allocates program costs among rate payers” and to “reflect actual costs.” An alternative to using a consultant
would be for staff to conduct the COS study. However, city resources do not provide for the specialized experience and skills required to develop an accurate cost model, and staff hours are not
available for a project of this magnitude. If the project is not completed, it is possible that rates will not reflect actual costs, will not provide the complete cost-recovery needed to provide waste
collection and disposal services, and costs may not be equitably allocated per city policy.

Fiscal Impact
The project is funded by the Solid Waste Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for monitoring of the Sunnyvale Landfill "Constituents of Concern." The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) enforces regulations that require the City
to routinely monitor the groundwater, surface water, and leachate in and around the closed landfill. The landfill is in Corrective Action status, for which the regulations normally require annual
"Constituents of Concern" sampling and analysis for the full list of possible pollutants, regardless of whether they have previously been detected at the site. However, the RWQCB has discretion to
approve less frequent monitoring and has approved the City's Corrective Action Plan, which calls for "Constituents of Concern" monitoring to occur once every five years. A total of 24 samples of
groundwater, leachate and surface water are collected, with the samples sent to a contract laboratory for analysis. A report on the results is prepared by an engineering consultant and sent to the
RWQCB.
This sampling and analysis requires significant additional expense at five-year intervals. "Constituents of Concern" sampling/analysis was last conducted during FY 2009/10.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
There are no alternatives to the project. CCR Title 27, Division 2, Chapter 3, Subchapter 3 requires the "Constituents of Concern" sampling and analysis to be done at least once every five years.
Eliminating or postponing the project would put the City out of compliance with its Corrective Action Plan and its Waste Discharge Requirements and expose it to RWQCB citations, fines, and
litigation.
The cost for sampling and analysis is based on the cost of the FY 2009/10 sampling/analysis event. The project has no impact on operating costs: it exists to isolate this infrequent, but costly,
"Constituents of Concern" sampling and analysis cost from the operating budget.

Fiscal Impact
The project is funded by the Solid Waste Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
State and Federal regulations require the City to continuously collect and destroy landfill gas (LFG) produced by decomposition of garbage in the closed Sunnyvale Landfill. The gas is normally
burned by engine-generators at the Water Pollution Control Plant to make electricity and is only burned in the LFG flare when the generators are off-line. Two blowers alternately provide vacuum
to the gas collection system and deliver gas to the flare. The flare, blowers, and related equipment were installed in 1987 and were expected to have a useful life of 30 years.
With the closure of the landfill in 1993, LFG quantities have declined below 300 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) and continue to drop. The current flare is too large for this flow and is having
difficulty achieving the 1400° F minimum exhaust temperature required by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). Replacement of the flare is necessary for regulatory
compliance. Design is complete and bids on the project were received on October 3, 2012. The flare, blowers, motors and check valves will be replaced with smaller equipment that is anticipated to
be used for another 20 years. A capacity retrofit to match even lower gas flows is budgeted at 5% of cost and shown in FY 2026/27. Cost estimates are based on vendor quotes and consultant and
staff estimates. The new blowers and flare will have 20-year lives if periodically refurbished.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The consulting engineers estimate the lower limit of blower operation to be 317 scfm. Staff projections show that this limit has been reached. The 25 horsepower (hp) blowers will soon be unable to
operate effectively and the check valves will be too large. Replacing the blowers with 10 or 15 hp blowers will allow their use through 2032. By 2032 the landfill will have been closed for 39 years
and, depending on gas generation rates, it may be possible to make a case at that time for turning off the landfill gas collection system.

Fiscal Impact
The project is funded by the Solid Waste Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides, at five-year intervals, an aerial photo and settlement analysis of the Sunnyvale Landfill. Stereo-paired aerial photography is used to produce updates of landfill topographic
maps. Comparison of the topography of the new and previous maps, via overlays, indicates the degree of settlement. An engineer's analysis of the settlement is performed to identify the possible
occurrence of differential settlement and related potential impacts to the landfill, its facilities and equipment, and potential slope stability issues. The aerial photo and settlement analysis was last
performed in FY 2009/10.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Aerial photography is the best and most cost-effective method of monitoring landfill settlement and potential differential settlement. Analysis of resulting data allows identification of areas more
prone to damaged facilities and equipment (e.g., cover, piping), and areas of potential slope instability. Performance at five-year intervals is required by California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title
27, Section 21142. However, more frequent analysis is a cost-effective method of maintaining optimal functioning of the landfill gas collection system, which provides significant energy savings
by generating electricity used to power the Water Pollution Control Plant.
Project costs include contracting with a vendor to perform the aerial photography, and analysis of settlement by a qualified engineering firm. Failure to perform required monitoring would place the
City in non-compliance, resulting in assessment of fines against the City, and possibly increasing costs for landfill repairs.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Solid Waste Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project replaces the City-owned Sunnyvale Materials Recovery and Transfer (SMaRT) Station with a new building and equipment. This facility will have been in operation for 30 years by FY
2023/24. At the present time the facility serves Sunnyvale, Mountain View and Palo Alto under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that expires in 2021. This project includes $100,000/year
for four years beginning in FY 2016/17 to determine who the facility participants will be beyond 2021, put in place the necessary legal documents to extend or replace the current MOU and provide
a design concept for a facility that meets the solid waste management needs articulated by the facility participants. The subsequent $30 million is for the design and construction of the facility.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The new facility will replace one that will have been in operation for 30 years. The SMaRT Station exists in a corrosive bayside environment and staff anticipates that the metal building and the
equipment it houses will be in need of replacement. The new facility will be designed to match the anticipated delivery quantities and needs of the ongoing facility participants. This could include
(1) continued truck transfer to Kirby Canyon Landfill (assuming a contract extension with Waste Management) or another landfill, (2) transfer by rail to a distant landfill or (3) preparation of
incoming waste for some to-be-determined waste conversion or energy recovery process.

Fiscal Impact
The design and construction of the $30 million project will be funded by the sale of utility revenue bonds. Project expenses in 2016/17 through 2019/20 ($400,000 total) will be financed by bonds
(to the extent allowed by law) and project participants. Debt service on the bonds is anticipated to be approximately the same (after inflation) as current SMaRT Station debt service costs. Facility
participants other than Sunnyvale will pay proportional shares of the debt service in a manner to be described in a new MOU or other participation agreement.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funded a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Initial Study and Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the adoption of Phase I (June 20, 2011) and Phase II (March 20, 2013)
of the Single-Use Carryout Bag Ordinance.
On December 18, 2012, Council directed staff to draft an ordinance banning expanded polystyrene (EPS) food containers. In doing so, Council expanded the scope of this project to use remaining
funds for CEQA review and implementation of the EPS ban.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The EIR on the ordinance banning single-use plastic carryout bags was prepared by Rincon Consultants and certified by Council on December 6, 2011. Phase I of the bag ordinance became
operative June 20, 2012 and Phase II will take effect on March 20, 2013.
A Negative Declaration was prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the EPS food container ban. The CEQA document and the EPS ordinance are anticipated to be considered
by Council in mid-2013. If the ordinance is adopted, implementation will follow at a date to be determined by Council.

Fiscal Impact
This project is equally funded by the Wastewater Management Fund and Solid Waste Management fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Sunnyvale Landfill closed in 1993. Post-closure maintenance of the landfill is performed per state requirements enforced by the Santa Clara County Department of Environmental Health, acting
as the Local Enforcement Agent (LEA). The LEA inspects the closed landfill, including the integrity of its clay cap, four times per year. As required by state regulations, the City closed the landfill
by placing over the waste an engineered clay cap to keep rain out and landfill gas in. Over the clay cap is a one-foot topsoil layer to support vegetation and prevent damage to the cap. The landfill
cover also contains piping to capture methane gas generated by decomposition of garbage.
The post-closure plan anticipates public use and provides roads and trails that go around the landfill and lead to the tops of hills used by the public. The landfill is extensively used for walking,
jogging, biking, and bird-watching. Despite the best efforts of staff, pedestrians and bicyclists have cut new, steep trails on which the vegetation is gone and the soil is subject to erosion.
The LEA has increasing concerns about the potential erosion of the topsoil and clay due to informal trail use. Staff has tried several times to revegetate or discourage/block access to the informal
trails, but without success. This project is needed to address the LEA concerns and to maintain regulatory compliance. In Phase I a design firm will develop a plan to protect the landfill cover and
provide bid documents. The Phase II funding amount will be updated when a cost estimate is provided by the designer. The design will guide trail users to planned trails, formalize (as appropriate)
informal trails, and discourage or make it impractical to make new informal trails. It will also take into consideration gas and condensate recovery systems, burrowing owl habitat, maintenance
access requirements, and the recreational interests of trail user groups.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
In light of concerns expressed by the LEA, staff believes it is only a matter of time until the LEA takes formal action. This would take the form of an order that the City address the damage caused
by informal trails and take specified actions in an LEA-determined time frame.
The proactive approach taken by this project allows the City to begin a thoughtful design process addressing existing damage to the landfill cover and minimizing future damage. Phase I (design) in
FY 2013/14 will provide a cost estimate for Phase II (construction) in FY 2014/15. The $250,000 estimate for Phase II will be updated based on the designer's cost estimate. An alternative would be
to close the landfill to public use. However, doing so would create expenses for fencing and other security measures and would be very unpopular with the public. The site is used extensively by the
public for recreation and is viewed as an amenity, especially by workers in Moffett Park.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Solid Waste Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This purpose of this project is to begin implementing the Zero Waste Strategic Plan (ZWSP) approved by Council on April 23, 2013 (RTC 13-085). Council directed staff to use the ZWSP to
increase the City's 2012 diversion rate from 65% to 70% by 2015, 75% by 2020 and 90% by 2030. In doing so, Council acknowledged that to implement all of the programs, the cost to solid the
waste collection ratepayers could increase rates by less than 1% to reach 70% and 4 to 7% to reach 75%. Reaching 70% diversion requires diverting an additional 12,925 tons of material compared
to existing conditions. Reaching 75% will require diverting another 12,925 tons, for total new diversion of 25,850 tons in just six years. Planning for these challenging diversion goals must begin
now. Sunnyvale has long been a regional and state-wide leader in planning and implementing policies and services to divert solid waste from disposal. However, the City's diversion rate has
plateaued in recent years. Without funding for new services, outreach to waste generators, and technical solutions, a significant increase in diversion is not possible. Note: the cost of reaching 90%
diversion cannot be estimated at this time due to uncertainty on legal and technical barriers to achieving that level of diversion.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Methods to immediately achieve 70% diversion by 2015 include (1)Steps to remove glass contaminants and design and implementation of new SMaRT equipment, (2)Developing/conducting pilot
programs to test how best to collect/market residential food scraps and commercial/multi-family yard trimmings, (3)City-wide implementation of multi-family recycling. Also, in an effort to “
practice what we preach” staff will be expanding/promoting internal ZW activities to City staff. To reach 75% diversion by 2020, staff will begin planning for expansion of a commercial food
program, hire a consultant to develop an outreach strategy which will result in increased recycling tonnage, implement pilot programs that were tested in #2 above, and implement collection of
additional curbside materials if feasible. This project does not include funding to achieve 90% diversion by 2030 as that will require rebuilding the SMaRT Station with new equipment (included in
Project #828260).

Fiscal Impact
Rate increases of less than 1% to reach 70% diversion and 4-7% rate increase will be needed to reach the 75% goal. Cost and rate impacts of reaching the 90% goal are unknown at this time, but
would be significant. Additional diversion will provide savings in landfill charges. Operating costs will increase if new routes are added to collect food scraps from residential households/yard
trimmings from multi-family/commercial sites. These costs are unknown until the pilot projects are conducted.

Runoff Pollution Prevention Program [SCVURPPP]
Contracting and Fiscal Agent activities. SCVURPPP
incorporates regulatory, monitoring and outreach
measures intended to reduce pollution in urban runoff
as much as possible. This program is a partnership
with the other cities and agencies in Santa Clara
County.

Major Wastewater Projects
The Wastewater Utility has a large number of varied
assets, including the sewer collection mains, storm
drains and pipes, pump and lift stations, and the
Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Many of these
assets are over 50 years old and have reached the end
of their useful lives. A Strategic Infrastructure Plan
(SIP) for replacement or rehabilitation of the WPCP has
been
completed.
To
provide
funding
for
recommendations from the SIP, several projects to
provide up to full replacement of the WPCP are
included in the long-term financial plan.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds emergency or incidental repairs to the sanitary sewer system. Examples of past work completed under this project include repairs to manholes, small spot or main line segment
repairs, and repairs or replacement of failed sewer laterals in the right-of-way.
This project is differentiated from other sewer main replacement projects by its intent to respond to emergency needs that may come up during a year, whereas other replacement projects will be
planned, designed, and involve sizeable contracts. This project will fund small, unanticipated problems that require a quick response on a relatively small scale.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The alternative is not to fund this project and delay the needed repairs until funds are requested and approved by Council on a case by case basis. These repairs are of an urgent nature most of the
time, and delay could result in adverse effects for public health and the environment should overflows occur. The city could also be subject to penalties and fines from regulatory agencies should
sewage discharges occur as result of deferring an emergency repair. Delaying can also result in higher repair costs.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Storm Pump Station Number 1 is located between the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) and the SMaRT Station. Sunnyvale operates two storm pump stations to pump accumulated storm
water into the San Francisco Bay. These are required due to areas of the City that are close to sea level and could suffer flooding. The center and north end of Sunnyvale drains to Storm Pump
Station #1. The facility consists of a structure with two large gas powered pumps, one small electric pump, three discharge pipes and a fenced yard.
The electrical feed for the pump station coming from the WPCP is directly buried in the levees without a protective conduit. Several additional items are included in the budget: the removal of
sediment and silt from the forebay area; replacing trash bar screens; relining or replacing the discharge pipes; plumbing a natural gas line to the facility for the gas powered engines; replacing or
updating the electrical panels to meet current codes; installing flow meters on the discharge pipes; installing updated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) components; and
addressing any other components identified during the feasibility study that are needed to comprehensively rehabilitate and update the pump station.
This project differs from project 825381, Storm Pump Station #1 Expansion, in that it is not dependent on Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) improvement of the Bay levee. This project
stands alone, and depends only on Sunnyvale's timetable and decision to proceed. The current identified budget is conceptual. The first stage of the project includes a feasibility study and basis of
design which will finalize the scope of work. Once the scope is finalized, the project costs can be reassessed and the budget adjusted as necessary. The FY 2016/17 budget is for the design of the
project, and the FY 2017/18 budget is for construction costs.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
If the project is not built, the City is at risk of complete failure of the pump station as the pumps would be very limited in their ability to discharge storm water. If that happens, flooding would
occur in the north and possibly central areas of Sunnyvale. The only alternative would be to rent or purchase emergency bypass pumps to discharge the storm water into the bay. It is prudent to
make timely repairs to avoid such costs.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funds for the rehabilitation of Storm Pump Station #2, east of Baylands Park. Sunnyvale operates two storm pump stations to pump accumulated storm water into tributaries to
the San Francisco Bay. These are required due to areas of the City that are close to sea level and could suffer flooding, particularly during large storms and exceptionally high tides. The current
configuration of Storm Pump Station #2 consists of a structure with six pumps (one small electric and five natural gas-powered engines), a storage pond surrounded by a levee, and an access road to
get to the facility. Several capital aspects of the facility must be periodically funded.
This station was built in 1962 and updated in 1967. The pumps and motors are original and need to be replaced. Alternative power sources for pump/motor replacement with an emergency back-up
power source are being considered. Several upgrades are also being considered for code compliance and operational efficiency including: rehabilitation or replacement of discharge piping;
installation of trash capture devices; upgrading electrical control panels and accessories to current standards; replacing SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) controls, which includes
the installation of a flow meter; and addressing other pump station rehabilitation items identified in the feasibility study.
Funding provides for the replacement of three pumps, a new Motor Control Center, structural rehabilitation, design and contingencies. Two options to complete this project were presented to the
City as part of the feasibility study. The project estimate is based on the option with which the City is proceeding. However, if there are significant issues with the permitting process, the City might
have to consider adding an additional construction phase to the project. The current budget does not include this contingency.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain existing essential infrastructure of the Wastewater Utility. Failure of this station to operate would result in flooding of the northeast portion of Sunnyvale.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funds for design and construction to renovate four digesters at the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP), including replacement of lids, rehabilitation and seismic retrofit of
the digester tanks themselves, the sludge mixing equipment, and related peripheral equipment. Digesters at the Water Pollution Control Plant are used to degrade solids removed from the
wastewater. The structural integrity of the digester lids must be maintained to prevent releases of potentially hazardous methane gas that could pose the potential for explosion and/or result in Bay
Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) violations.
Digesters #1 and #2 were built in 1955, #3 in 1961, and #4 in 1969. The digester lids have deteriorated, and methane gas has been found between the structural layers of the lids. Spot repairs have
been completed and have provided some addition to the lids' useful life, but are no longer adequate. To prevent failure, the lids need to be replaced. Replacement is estimated to extend the life of the
digesters by 30 years. Digester #3 was completed in FY 2008/09, Digester #4 in FY 2010/11. Design for Digesters #1 and #2 is underway, with construction scheduled in FY 2013/14 and FY
2014/15 to accommodate process shutdowns without compromising treatment capacity.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
As recommended in the Strategic Infrastructure Plan (SIP), these digesters have been determined to be necessary irrespective of the treatment process alternative chosen for the construction of the
new WPCP. Therefore, this investment is an integral part of the construction of the new WPCP and does not create any unnecessary redundancies. Operating costs are not anticipated to vary
significantly from historical experience although some automation improvements are being made which could have a positive impact.

Fiscal Impact
The project will be funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Every five years, the Utilities Division in the Department of Finance performs a cost of service study of the wastewater system to update and align the City's wastewater rates with the costs
associated with providing service. Staff works with a utility finance specialist to develop a cost of service model and populate the model with current data. The study generates a cost of service for
each customer class and recommends adjustments to the City's rates and rate structure to ensure costs are recovered on an equitable basis from the different customer classes.
The most recent analysis was done in FY 2011/12. This project provides funding to hire a consultant that will support staff's effort to refresh the analysis every five years.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
State law (Proposition 218) requires that utility rates reflect the cost of providing service. Additionally, this study confirms that the revenues generated through rates are sufficient to cover the cost
of providing service. Costs are slightly higher than for the water utility cost of service study to provide funding for any needed wastewater testing.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for the design and construction of a new primary treatment process at the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). The scope includes funding for design and
construction of the replacement of the current headworks, primary sedimentation tanks, influent pump station, grit removal facilities, and associated electrical, mechanical and control systems.
Primary treatment provides the removal of solids and floating material from the wastewater stream. The ten primary sedimentation basins in the SPCP are reinforced concrete structures with
process piping, mechanical drives and motors, and associated instrumentation. The oldest of the primary tanks were part of the original plant built in 1955. The concrete in these tanks is falling off
in large chunks, exposing the reinforced steel inside the structures. Once the reinforced steel is exposed to the atmosphere, it corrodes at a fairly rapid rate, and this can threaten the structural
integrity of the basins. In addition, the primary tanks were built before the current, more stringent seismic requirements were put in place, so the current structures are vulnerable to earthquake
damage.
The WPCP Strategic Infrastructure Plan (SIP) was completed in 2010, and it recommended full replacement and relocation of primary treatment, influent pumping and headworks, grit removal, and
power distribution facilities, to the current sludge drying paved area east of the current primary tanks.
The project implementation schedule is estimated to be a total of five years with design scheduled to begin in FY 2013/14 and construction scheduled to begin in FY 2015/16.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Replacement is needed to restore structural integrity to the basins, to eliminate safety and public health hazards, and to provide for effective treatment as required by the plant National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The SIP consultant has indicated that primary treatment would be necessary under any of the treatment alternatives considered in the SIP, as it
provides the most cost-effective type of preliminary treatment as well as significant energy benefits. The total cost will be validated and updated through the master planning effort which will be
accomplished under a separate project.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Air Flotation Tanks (AFTs) are used to remove algae that grow during secondary treatment in the oxidation ponds. Three of these structures were built in 1975 and the fourth in 1982, and all are in
need of significant rehabilitation. This project includes repair/replacement of the steel and mechanical portion of each structure, repair and/or replacement of the influent gates, and coating of the
concrete walls, extending their useful life for approximately 15-20 years. AFTs 2 & 3 are currently being rehabilitated and are scheduled for completion in FY 2012/13. AFTs 1 & 4 are currently in
design and are scheduled for rehabilitation in FY 2013/14.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
During construction of the first two AFTs (2&3) several unforeseen conditions were encountered that escalated the project costs. As a result, additional retrofit scope was added to the next two
AFTs (1&4). These items include the replacement of the pressurization tanks on each AFT, a collector drive on AFT #4, and other mechanical components.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is for repair, replacement, and rehabilitation of sewer pipes. The City has over 280 miles of sewer lines, from 6 inches to 48 inches in diameter, valued at over $200 million. Many of
the lines are 50 or more years old. Pipe failures have been occurring, and deficiencies have been noted at several locations. This project repairs, replaces, or rehabilitates sewer mains as they are
assessed. Alternative technologies are investigated to apply the best method for each location, including open-trench replacement, "trenchless" pipe-bursting/replacement, or pipe-lining.
The project provides for rehabilitating approximately one mile of sewer main pipe per year including associated items such as manholes and lateral piping. Based on recent projects, the design and
construction average cost is about $180 per lineal foot. This project relies upon condition assessment methods, most commonly the findings of video inspection, to identify locations in need of
replacement or rehabilitation each year. This project will be revised based upon the upcoming Wastewater Master Plan findings. The project will also reduce sanitary sewer overflows as well as
reduce inflow and infiltration which results in higher treatments costs.
The project scope may include repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of appurtenances consistent with a pipeline repair, rehabilitation, and replacement project. These items may include: manhole
repair, rehabilitation, and/or replacement including the structure and associated components; sewer lateral piping and connections; cleanout installation; construction materials such as backfill and
surface restoration (paving); cross connection eliminations; and other related items as identified.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to comply with regulatory standards which require agencies to rehabilitate and/or replace sanitary sewer system piping and associated components. The alternative to
replacement of sewer pipes in bad shape would be to repair them segment by segment on an emergency basis. Public health and the environment could be threatened and fines could be levied
against the City should overflows occur as a result of a pipe failure. Further, repairing or replacing segments of pipeline on an emergency basis would be significantly costlier than scheduled
replacements.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides ongoing replacement/repair/rehabilitation of the City's 327 miles of storm drain pipes. The storm system infrastructure is, on average, 50 years old. This project will repair,
replace, or rehabilitate storm drain pipes, depending on condition, at a rate of approximately 800 linear feet per year at $280 per foot. Storm systems are not generally subjected to the same
conditions as sewer systems, and can be expected to last longer.
This project is also for repair, replacement, and rehabilitation of storm drain pipes. The City has over 320 miles of storm lines, from 6 inches to 84 inches in diameter, valued at over $200 million.
Many of the lines are 50 or more years old. This project repairs, replaces, or rehabilitates storm mains as they are identified. Alternative technologies are investigated to apply the best method for
each location, including open-trench replacement, "trenchless" pipe-bursting/replacement, or pipe-lining.
The project additionally provides for repair, replacement, or rehabilitation of approximately 500 feet of storm main pipe per year. Based on recent projects, the design and construction average cost
is about $200 to $250 per lineal foot depending on pipe diameter. This project has been expanded to include manhole rehabilitation which was previously completed under a separate project. This
project relies upon condition assessment methods, most commonly the findings of video inspection, to identify locations in need of replacement or rehabilitation each year. This project will be
revised based upon the upcoming Wastewater Master Plan findings. This project is necessary to assure storm water conveyance and mitigate system failures which can result in flooding.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The other alternatives to the project are either not to fund it or to delay funding to later years. If funding is not provided or delayed for too long, however, breaks in the system due to aging might
develop that could cause flooding and property damage. Emergency repairs would then be necessary, which are usually more expensive than scheduled replacements. The Wastewater Master Plan,
which is currently being developed and will be completed in FY 2013/14, will identify areas of the storm drain collection system which are in need of rehabilitation or upgrading.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for the expansion of Storm Pump Station #1, which is located between the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) and the SMaRT Station. Sunnyvale operates two
storm pump stations to pump accumulated storm water into the San Francisco Bay. These are required for areas close to sea level that could suffer flooding during large storms and high tides. The
facility consists of a structure with two gas powered pumps, one small electric pump, and three discharge pipes. This is the second of two projects proposed for this location. This project differs
from project 822752, Storm Pump Station Number 1 Rehabilitation, in that it is completely dependent on Santa Clara Valley Water District's (SCVWD) improvement of the Bay levee. The project
will not start unless and until the District has finished the levee improvements.
Work in this project consists of two phases: (1) dredging the holding area and (2) expanding the building and adjacent site modifications. The holding area has a small portion extending south, and a
much larger basin extending to the east. Due to the nature of the basin (wetland), constant water flow through the storm system, power lines in the center, and overall environmental issues, this item
is projected to cost $1.6 million (in current dollars) to build. The project budget consists of environmental permitting (FY 2022/23), engineering design (FY 2023/24), and dredging (FY 2023/24
and FY 2024/25).
The remaining budget is for a new building to replace the existing one, which is not adequate to meet a 100-year flood and does not have emergency power. This portion of the project includes new
pumps, discharge piping, a generator, and related road work. Building improvements are not proposed until after the SCVWD makes improvements to the Bay levee under its jurisdiction and
completes raising the main levee to the 100-year flood plain elevation.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The only other alternative is to delay funding of the project and needed repairs. If funding is delayed for too long, however, this pump station would not be able to accommodate storm water during
a heavy storm or prolonged heavy rain season. This project is a continuation of the Pump Station 1 rehabilitation, but the work cannot be done until the SCVWD raises the main levee to the 100year flood plain elevation.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for sediment removal from oxidation ponds at the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). The oxidation ponds provide secondary treatment using the natural action of
sun and wind to facilitate the growth of algae, which takes up dissolved waste from the wastewater. No solids have been removed from the ponds since inception of secondary pond treatment in the
late 1960s. An estimate from 2006 calculates the accumulation of solids to be at 35% to 45%.
The Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) utilizes large facultative ponds (440 acres) that remove/convert residential and low strength industrial wastes into stable cellular matter.
Solids produced from this biological process are in the form of algae that is concentrated, removed from the process, and then returned back to the ponds to further decompose over time on the pond
bottom. This accumulation of solids has reduced the treatment capacity of the ponds by almost 50%, significantly impacting the process performance and thereby jeopardizing permit compliance.
This project was initiated in 2009 to address the accumulation of these solids through dredging and pumping the slurry to a centrifuge to remove water prior to hauling it off site for disposal. After
initial delays associated with the contract procurement, logistics of establishing the dredge in the pond, setting up the dewatering facilities, and other equipment challenges, the project has had a
successful year of solids removal in FY 2012/13.
Based on the successful dredging rates in FY 2012/13, it is anticipated that this rate of activity will need to continue into FY 2013/14 and FY 2014/15. At that point, the development of the WPCP
Master Plan will be complete, which will define the future uses of the ponds. The decision to continue or terminate this project at that time will be evaluated based on the recommendations from the
Master Plan and WPCP operational performance with respect to ammonia removals.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The WPCP has strict discharge requirements related to ammonia concentration in the WPCP effluent. Reduced capacity of the ponds due to solids accumulation affects the ammonia removal ability
of the ponds. The rate of dredging of the solids needs to be carefully monitored such that the disturbance caused by the dredging does not stir up the accumulated solids to an extent that causes
further deterioration of the water quality in the ponds. As the solids on the bottom are dredged, the WPCP produces solids from everyday wastewater processing which continue to accumulate in
the ponds. Due to the balanced steady dredging and the continual accumulation from everyday operations, the rate of capacity restoration of the ponds is relatively slow and needs to be spread out
over several years. Operating costs will not change based on completion of the project.

Fiscal Impact
This project will be funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City currently operates five sewer lift stations which use electric motors to convey sewage to the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Pump station components have a life expectancy of
about 20 years. This project includes overhaul and/or replacement of pumps; rehabilitation of wet wells and associated piping; installation of traffic covers, flow meters, SCADA (Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition) and electrical panels; and other improvements to increase energy efficiency and lower maintenance and operations costs. The design of the rehabilitation of all five
sanitary sewer lift stations will be performed in FY 2012/13, with the construction occurring in the following year.
A comprehensive condition assessment of each sewer lift station is included within the scope of the design work, upon which the design for work on each lift station will be based. Pending the
results of the full design work, the construction activity to rehabilitate each lift station may be phased, prioritizing the most urgent needs first. The current identified budget is conceptual. Once the
full design effort is finalized, the project construction costs can be reassessed and the budget adjusted as necessary.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Repair and replacement of equipment will reduce the need for emergency repairs and improve the reliability of the lift stations. The project will thus preserve the City's investment in its
infrastructure and prevent issues which could be inconvenient, costly, and unsanitary.
The only alternatives are to not fund this project or delay it. This could lead to failure of the sewer lift stations resulting in expensive emergency repairs. Public health and the environment could be
impacted and fines could be levied against the City should overflows occur as a result of a lift station failure.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City of Sunnyvale is one of 15 members of the Santa Clara Valley Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Program (SCVURPPP). SCVURPPP was formed to implement the National Pollution
Discharge Elimination Permit (NPDES) issued to the cities, county, and Santa Clara Valley Water District who discharge storm water to the San Francisco Bay. These 15 agencies have signed a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and pay annual assessments to cover the cost of programmatic activities related to implementing the NPDES Permit.
The Memorandum of Agreement provides for the selection of one of the members as the program's Contracting and Fiscal Agent. The City of Sunnyvale has been selected as the program's
Contracting and Fiscal Agent. The Contracting and Fiscal Agent provides billing and payment services for SCVURPPP and acts as the awarding authority for any contracts that the agency wishes
to enter into.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City of Sunnyvale is providing billing and payment services for SCVURPPP and acting as the awarding authority for any contracts that the agency wishes to enter into.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) has been undergoing major planning efforts over the last few years to methodically design and implement the various capital improvements necessary to
rebuild it. A 2006 condition assessment report identified replacement of the primary effluent pipeline as a high priority because of its age and lack of redundancy in pumping wastewater beyond
primary treatment, should a failure of this pipeline occur. This project was initiated in FY 2007/08, and updated engineering evaluations have found that it will require significantly higher costs
than originally anticipated for the by-pass pipeline.
As further options were evaluated, staff discovered the alternative of combining this project with another related to compliance with air regulations for the influent pump engines. In order to meet
air quality regulations, the influent pump engines will have to be abandoned from operation by 2015, thereby necessitating the provision of alternative influent pumping solutions. Staff proposes
making modifications to the existing auxiliary pump station (APS) at the WPCP such that it would function as the primary influent pump station, with the main influent pump engines providing
back-up pump capacity. APS currently functions as a wet-weather influent pumping station. This project would combine the APS modifications with a much cheaper alternative for the by-pass
pumping pipeline so that the combined system could be utilized in case of failure of the primary effluent pipeline.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The modifications to the APS would include refurbishments of the existing pumps, adding an additional pump, potential addition of variable frequency drives, providing stand-by power, addition of
a conveyor belt, and screening removal mechanism. The extent of the project will need further refinement and scope development is currently underway, with implementation scheduled for FY
2013/14. Current cost estimates are based on a preliminary engineering study done in 2011, and staff estimates are based on previous implementation of similar elements elsewhere at the WPCP.

Fiscal Impact
This project will be funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide for the multi-disciplinary (structural, civil, electrical, corrosion) engineering review of the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) on a periodic basis. As part of long-range
infrastructure planning for the WPCP, a periodic condition assessment of plant facilities is needed in order to prioritize repair/replacement projects and provide for a systematic approach to capital
budget planning. The next assessment is scheduled for FY 2030/31, which is five years after the anticipated completion of the new Water Pollution Control Plant.
The information will be used to define existing conditions and priorities as part of the ongoing predictive maintenance efforts. Funds should be allocated at five year intervals to maintain this level
of evaluation. An assessment should be completed periodically to track the condition and deterioration of assets so that repair/replacement projects can be timed appropriately and the various needs
can be prioritized. This data will then be input into the plant’s asset database for evaluation and comparison to be used in managing the WPCP infrastructure. The schedule and cost for these
assessments will be reevaluated at the completion of the WPCP Strategic Infrastructure Plan (SIP) and the first update to the asset condition assessment.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Periodic assessment and comparison of actual condition of WPCP assets with agreed-upon service levels and predicted useful lives facilitates determination of least life-cycle costs for these assets.
This information can then be used to provide for capital planning, to minimize the effect on sewer rates.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for a master plan for the sanitary sewer system and storm drain system. The project is one of the next steps in the Long Range Infrastructure Plan. The project will
update citywide vertical control/benchmark systems, assess the hydraulics, system models, physical condition, and separation and maintenance of the collection systems, and will recommend
improvements to provide adequate hydraulic capacity and improve the reliability of the collection system. It will include an analysis of the financial impacts of the recommendations and
scheduling, and may inform revisions to Project 825331, Replacement, Rehabilitation, and Repair of Sewer Pipes.
The City provides sanitary sewer services to residents and businesses within the City as well as a portion of Cupertino known as Rancho Rinconada. This study is needed to define the capital
projects that will be necessary to replace aging infrastructure and to identify any capacity-increasing projects that may be needed as a result of in-fill development. Developing a comprehensive
master plan is consistent with stipulations associated with Federal and State regulatory requirements for managing wastewater collection system assets. This type of plan is considered to be a best
management practice for ensuring that the wastewater collection system can continue to provide reliable service.
The project began in FY 2011/12 and is expected to be completed in FY 2013/14. The project will analyze and develop alternatives for future wastewater capital projects and funding.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain existing essential infrastructure of the Wastewater Utility. The information developed as a result of this study can allow the City to require developers to pay for
capacity increases or for rehabilitation of existing sewers. This project will also fulfill several regulatory requirements for wastewater asset management.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is intended to provide full replacement or rehabilitation of the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). The original components of the WPCP were completed in 1956, many of which
are still in service. Other components of the plant were completed during the next 15-20 years, so that even the newest components are approximately 25 years old. Many of the components are at
or very near the end of their useful life.
This project is based on the recommendations from the Strategic Infrastructure Plan (SIP) and reflects the significant amount of work needed to replace the plant in order to maintain current service
levels and meet future needs. This project will fund the most cost-effective alternative or mix of rehabilitation and replacement as determined by the SIP which was completed in FY 2010/11 and is
being further refined by the current master planning effort conducted under a separate project.
If one or more of the major components or unit treatment processes at the plant were to experience a significant or catastrophic failure prior to this project being implemented, funds would need to
be moved forward from this project to provide for the replacement/repair of that component.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
To address the deteriorating condition of the WPCP, the SIP was initiated to evaluate repair/replacement options and new technology. The study's goal was to analyze the technical and economic
feasibility of various approaches to wastewater treatment for the next 30-50 years. This effort has been completed and the next step is to move forward with completing the master planning effort,
Programmatic Environmental Impact Report, and the Primaries. These tasks are being carried out under separate projects.
This project is the funding source for the entire program, and its budget is being decreased to fund the projects specified above. Its budget and timeframes are based on the Plant Rehabilitation
Scenario documented in the SIP. This project's scope, schedule, and budget will be updated as necessary with the progression of the master planning effort. Projected operating savings beginning in
FY 2024/25 reflect estimated labor cost savings associated with improved plant automation.

Fiscal Impact
This project will be funded through the issuance of utility revenue bonds. Debt will be issued in series as needed, with debt service stepping up through the construction of the facility until fully
funded.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is to update the data system used by, and to provide handheld data entry devices to, the Environmental Service Department’s Environmental Compliance Inspectors and Lab/Field
Technicians in the Regulatory Programs Division. This project will aim to integrate (or replace) the various databases currently used to manage inspection data, and enable inspection and sampling
activities by inspectors to be recorded on a hand-held data entry device and uploaded to a database for further tracking, trend analysis, regulatory reporting, work scheduling, and enforcement
actions. It will achieve greater efficiencies by making inspection data more readily available, reducing the possibility of human error in transcribing paper inspection reports to a database,
minimizing the possibility of lost or misplaced paper files, and reducing the time needed to gather and store inspection data. Current methods are error-prone, slow, and consume staff time that
could be better used for other critical tasks.
The cost to implement is estimated at $200,000. Operating costs are estimated at $16,740 annually thereafter for software licensing and equipment replacement. These data were derived from costs
for a different hand-held data device project for Maintenance and Operations staff. Replacement is estimated at five-year intervals, but will be evaluated and budgeted when appropriate
hardware/software platforms have been identified.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Other pretreatment programs in Bay Area cities already use such equipment and databases to handle their work. New requirements and increased inspections and sampling pertaining to the
Stormwater Permit for activities related to new and redevelopment, commercial, and significant industrial user programs, as well as newer requirements relating to mercury reduction for dental
facilities and grease management and food service establishments, mean an increased workload for the program. This project will help the program keep pace with the increased needs.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Lawrence Expressway Sanitary Sewer trunk main is a critical pipe for carrying sewage from the southern and eastern portions of the City and the Rancho Rinconada area of Cupertino to the
Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). The line was originally installed in 1963 and has a life expectancy of approximately 50 years. The Lawrence Trunk Line has been impacted by corrosive
sewer gases over the years. Several structural defects have been found during inspections of the pipe. An analysis, assessment and rehabilitation is necessary to ensure continued serviceability. This
project would identify and rehabilitate severely degraded portions of the sewer trunk main pipeline along the Lawrence Expressway from Homestead Road to Elko Drive.
The first stage of the project will include a preliminary design report and a thorough condition assessment. The condition assessment will include an inspection of the pipe and an engineering
assessment of the capacity and flow dynamics. This will identify and prioritize the line segments in the most need of rehabilitation and repair. Feasibility of a relocation or realignment might be
considered during this phase. The cost basis was derived from conceptual estimates for lining 20,000 lineal feet of pipe. Once the scope, rehabilitation options, and estimates are refined during
preliminary design, the costs will be reviewed and updated as necessary.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Not funding this project could result in a complete failure of the Lawrence Sanitary Sewer Trunk Main piping system. Due to the high volume of sewage that the line conveys, a failure of this
magnitude could be an environmental disaster as the Lawrence Expressway roadway could potentially develop a sinkhole if the City takes no action.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City storm water system operates under the terms of a Municipal Stormwater National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Provision C.10 of the permit requires
municipalities to install and maintain a minimum number of full trash capture devices and also to implement activities to achieve specific reductions: 40% by 2014, 70% by 2017, and 100% (or zero
impacts) by 2022. The devices prevent the trash from entering the storm drain system and polluting creeks and the San Francisco Bay. Installation of larger CDS (Continuous Deflection Separation)
and/or net type trash recovery devices are preferred to catch larger quantities at centralized locations, which reduces maintenance to the individual trash capture devices. Larger trash recovery units
will be installed in larger storm lines in strategic locations to maximize recovery. Estimates have come in at approximately $400,000 per large unit installed. Installing these devices is an important
component of a multi-faceted approach to reaching the mandated reduction targets.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will help the City comply with the terms of the NPDES permit for trash recovery. The City must be in compliance with the minimum trash capture requirements (based on a small
percent of drainage area captured) and the 40% reduction target of the permit by 2014. An alternative approach would be to install smaller devices in each catch basin. While the installation costs
would be lower, the ongoing costs for maintenance would likely exceed the cost of larger units. As the City expands implementation of trash reduction activities to meet the progressively more
strict targets between now and 2022, a combination of large and small devices will likely be needed to fit into the existing infrastructure. This project will not retrofit the entire storm infrastructure;
additional activities will be needed to meet the permit requirements over time.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the complete cleaning, sediment removal, and inspection of all sanitary sewer siphons.
The city sanitary sewer system contains 18 siphons of varying sizes, most of which are located at and carry flow under the Central Expressway. Siphons pose a unique challenge in sewer systems
operation because they have low spots which collect debris. Conventional sewer cleaning methods do not adequately remove debris from siphons. As a result, the siphons require specialized
cleaning at regular intervals. Ten-year cycles for complete debris removal are industry standard to ensure proper system function.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The only alternative is not to remove the sediment buildup in the siphons. Public health could be threatened and fines could be levied against the City should overflows occur as a result of a sewer
stoppage in a sewer siphon.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the design and construction of a liquid chlorine disinfection system to replace the existing gaseous chlorine system. Upon completion, the liquid chlorine system will be
used for all disinfection in the short term. The design of the liquid chlorine disinfection system is scheduled through FY 2013/14 with construction beginning in FY 2014/15.
The design phase of the project includes the preparation of predesign studies and basis of design reports for other Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) functions related to the disinfection
system. These items include evaluating an alternate de-chlorination injection point, the potential for simultaneous production of recycled water, and the reduction of total dissolved solids in the
recycled water. Once these studies and reports are completed in FY 2013/14, WPCP staff will determine with which options to proceed and develop a plan going forward. The funding for design
and construction resulting from the additional disinfection functions is included in FY 2014/15.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The long-term plan for disinfection at WPCP is likely a combination of liquid chlorine and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. UV disinfection involves no chemicals, so is even safer than liquid chlorine.
However, UV disinfection technology is expensive to construct and operate, so immediate installation may be premature as the technology is still improving.
A likely future scenario is using “right-sized” UV disinfection for normal flows to Bay discharge supplemented by liquid chlorine. In the long term, liquid chlorine would be used in three situations:
during very high peak flows to supplement UV (reducing capital cost of the UV system), as a full back-up system, and for all recycled water(chlorine residual is required in recycled water lines as
UV does not provide the required residual). The product cost of liquid chlorine is greater than gaseous chlorine, but experience at other plants has shown this will be offset by savings from reduced
requirements needed to handle toxic gases.

Fiscal Impact
Current projects are being funded with a combination of proceeds from the 2010 Wastewater Revenue Bonds and ongoing rate revenue, which is accounted for in the Wastewater Management Fund’
s reserves.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) has been undergoing major planning efforts over the last few years to methodically design and implement the various capital improvements necessary to
rebuild it. One of the main components of that reconstruction is the primary process of the treatment which removes large debris and solids from the wastewater. The reconstruction of this area of
the WPCP and transition to using these new facilities is anticipated to be complete in 2018. Meanwhile, for the next five to six years until that transition is complete, this facility will need to
continue to operate reliably to provide primary treatment.
A 2005 condition assessment report identified the primary process to be the most at risk process area of the WPCP. Staff has implemented several immediate rehabilitation measures identified in
that report. However, in the past six years, further spalling of concrete, rusting rebar and concrete erosion has caused significant deterioration of the tanks. The deterioration is to such an extent that
staff had to restrict maintenance vehicle access on the structure, and as it continues to deteriorate it poses a potential safety concern for staff and the public as well.
This project implementation is phased over a two year period to allow for continued operations of the WPCP. It is anticipated that the oldest and most risky elements of the primary tanks will be
addressed in FY 2013/14 with the more complicated elements, such as the channel gate modifications, planned for FY 2014/15.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
A recent site visit conducted by the structural engineering firm identified the following immediate improvements: structural reinforcement of the tank walls, repair and structural enhancement of the
grating supports, structural strengthening of the outlet channels, repair to the off-gas box, re-alignment and refurbishment of the slide gate and operating mechanisms, and reinforcement of the crossover tubes between the aerated grit tanks and primary tanks. The extent of repairs will need further refinement and scope development, but would likely consist of concrete repair, epoxy injection,
coatings and some mechanical refurbishment. Current cost estimates are based on the 2005 condition assessment report and preliminary order of magnitude estimates provided by a structural
engineering firm.

Fiscal Impact
This project will be funded by the Wastewater Management fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Strategic Infrastructure Plan (SIP) developed for the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) identified two separate options for rebuilding the WPCP. Further refinement and selection of the
final option to be implemented is part of the master planning process for the WPCP (New Project) which is currently under procurement for engineering services. Whichever option is chosen, the
City is still ten to twelve years away from completion of construction of the new secondary process. In the interim, some extensive rehabilitation is necessary to maintain operations of the WPCP
and compliance with our NPDES permit.
Rehabilitation may include: the media replacement and refurbishment of the Fixed Growth Reactors (FGR); incorporation of chemical treatment facilities for predator (snail) control to ensure
effective performance; upgrades to the Polymer feed system; and, pump rehabilitation for the pond recirculation station, FGR pumps and pond effluent pumps. Levee maintenance will be required
as well to address subsidence and weed abatement. Cost estimates for these elements are based on vendor quotes, benchmarking with other agencies, and preliminary estimates from engineering
consultants. Specification development and implementation planning will require additional engineering efforts which will form the first phase of this project.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Project implementation is phased over a three year period to allow for continued operation of the WPCP and sequencing of the processes and equipment to ensure adequate processing capacity for
the incoming wastewater. It is anticipated that the preliminary engineering design and predator control efforts will be performed in FY 2013/14 with more comprehensive rehabilitation of the
mechanical elements, media replacement, and levee maintenance scheduled for FY 2014/15 and FY 2015/16.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) has two large engine generators capable of generating 800kW of power each. This Power Generation Facility (PGF) was built in 1997 with the gas
management/controls systems to generate power using three fuel sources: landfill gas, digester gas, and natural gas. The landfill stopped accepting waste in 1993 and as it ages the quantity and
quality of landfill gas continues to decrease. Stricter emission requirements imposed by the California Air Resources Board and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District also continue to raise
the cost of operating the engines, requiring frequent tune-ups and additional gas pre-treatment. These complex operational parameters combined with the corrosive environment under which the
engines operate causes serious stability issues. Over the last few years there were several instances when the engines “dropped” off the power distribution grid, resulting in immediate demand on
PG&E, which provides back-up power. This instantaneous load results in significant cost increases to the WPCP utility bill, estimated at $80,000 to $100,000 per year in demand charges and peak
day pricing. Of much more significant concern is the loss of redundancy and increased risk of operating the WPCP with only one source of power, i.e. PG&E. Additionally, legislation and
regulation are currently being considered to further reduce emissions associated with combustion power generation for the WPCP engine types. Initial review indicates that compliance under these
new standards will likely require urgent modifications to the controls systems and gas treatment. The scope of this project includes a comprehensive engineering assessment of all components of the
gas management and emission control systems, control and power generation systems such as the gas meters, gas blend units, pressure regulation systems, digester gas flare operation, and gas
treatment system.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
As the WPCP goes through design and construction of the new facilities, replacement and upgrade of the PGF is currently scheduled in the last phase of the reconstruction, likely 10-12 years away.
This project is proposed to evaluate and implement measures to ensure reliable and compliant operations of the PGF in the interim. The landfill gas flare and blowers are already under replacement
with a targeted completion date of 2014. This project addresses the WPCP components of the power generation system. The FY 2013/14 work schedule includes an engineering assessment, and
developing alternatives and recommendations. Construction is scheduled for FY 2014/15. The cost estimates are based on preliminary order of magnitude estimates from the engineering consultant,
vendor quotes, and benchmarking information from agencies which have implemented similar projects. Refinement of the costs and scope development will be part of the engineering assessment.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management fund.

final option to be implemented is part of the master planning process for the WPCP (New Project) which is currently under procurement for engineering services. Whichever option is selected, the
City is still ten to twelve years away from completion of construction of the new secondary process. Therefore, extensive rehabilitation of the existing tertiary process is necessary to maintain
operations of the WPCP and compliance with our NPDES permit. The tertiary process of the WPCP consists of four Dual Media Filters (DMF), which are large tanks filled with sand and anthracite
coal that provide filtration, and disinfection facilities consisting of chlorine contact tanks. WPCP experienced failure on one battery (each filter has two batteries) of one of the filters in 2011 and
minimal repairs were made which included media replacement and replacement of over a thousand nozzles in the system. All four filters were constructed around the same time, and a similar
failure of others is likely if they are not rehabilitated in time. The rest of the filters and systems were inspected and found to need similar rehabilitation and more comprehensive structural
enhancement to ensure reliable operations for the next decade. The scope of the work will include corrosion protection, equipment upgrades, and media and nozzle replacement. The project also
includes improvements to the disinfection structures, such as coating three of the chlorine contact channels to address corrosion of the concrete structures.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Cost estimates for this project are based on vendor quotes, past expenditures for such rehabilitation efforts, and preliminary order of magnitude estimates from engineering consultants.
Specification development and implementation planning will require additional engineering efforts which will form the first phase of this project.
Project implementation is phased over a three year period to allow for continued operation of the WPCP and sequencing of the processes and equipment to ensure adequate processing capacity for
the incoming wastewater. It is anticipated that each of the remaining three filters will be rehabilitated one per year in FY 2014/15, FY 2015/16 and FY 2016/17 with the chlorine contact channel
rehabilitation planned for FY 2016/17.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds implementation of a comprehensive system to manage laboratory data. The ESD laboratory provides critical analytical services for both wastewater and drinking water. The
primary function of the lab is to provide timely and high quality data. Currently, the laboratory performs more than 30,000 analyses per year, and the majority of them are manually entered into
some form of data system, primarily an MS Access database that is maintained by an outside consultant. A contemporary Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) would maximize the
integration of data collection from individual laboratory instruments and feed that data into an integrated system. LIMS products are the norm for laboratories of comparable size and function. The
outcomes are improved efficiency of data entry, improved integrity of data accuracy, and greater functionality of the system for monitoring lab productivity and efficiency.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will dramatically reduce the amount of manual data entry currently conducted in the laboratory. Currently, data is entered into different systems for different services; having an
integrated LIMS will allow for more effective and efficient management of the data. Additionally, a LIMS will provide for more robust information on lab workflow such as turnaround times and
workload. Without a LIMS, the laboratory will not be able to meaningfully improve efficiency or data quality, both of which are of increasing importance as the Water Pollution Control Plant
enters the implementation phase of the Plant rebuild, during which process control activity and pilot testing are expected to increase.
The project’s costs include $150,000 for procurement of the software system and $100,000 for consultant support to implement and integrate it with lab equipment. These costs were based on
market review and comparison with a lab of similar capacity and requirements.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is for Program Management Consultant (PMC) services related to the Water Pollution Control Plant reconstruction program. The PMC will be responsible for quality assurance related
to project design documents and will assist the City in evaluating design consultant recommendations for equipment selection and design features. The PMC will provide oversight and coordination
services for current operations and ongoing rehabilitation work with the master planning efforts, environmental reports, multiple design and construction contracts, construction management, and
control systems integration and programming services. The PMC will also be responsible for establishing, maintaining, and tracking project budgets and schedules.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City does not have the appropriate technical expertise and resources available to manage a program of this magnitude. Since the amount and type of resource expertise required will fluctuate
during the various phases of the program, and the program is only for a defined period, it is in the City's best interest to hire consultant resources to deliver the program. Staff anticipates that these
services will be required through FY 2023/24 at a minimum. As the master planning (accomplished under a separate project) progresses, staff will revalidate the schedules and budgets as necessary
and recommend the required adjustments.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is for Master Planning services related to the Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) reconstruction program. The Master Planning Consultant (MPC) will be responsible for preparing
preliminary engineering studies, reports and investigations necessary to further analyze and develop the concepts outlined in the Strategic Infrastructure Plan. The MPC will also be responsible for
preparing the Programmatic Environmental Impact Report for the entire program. The final outcome of this project will include taking each of the program's design elements to the 10% design
stage and completing all the necessary, related design standards. At the conclusion of this project, the program will be fully developed and all the necessary design and construction packages will be
defined. The City can then begin implementing the design and construction of the various components necessary to reconstruct the WPCP.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Strategic Infrastructure Plan which was completed in 2010 outlined various concepts for reconstructing the WPCP. The goal of this project is to further analyze those concepts and develop a
master plan for reconstructing the WPCP. This is essential so that the City can fully understand the scope, schedule, and budget for the entire reconstruction program and have a well thought out
plan to complete it.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds a study that will identify sources of direct Inflow and Infiltration (I&I) of ground water into the sanitary sewer collection system. I&I contributes to additional hydraulic loading in
the collection system which increases treatment costs as well as reduces design collection system conveyance capacity. I&I causes poor recycled water quality. The City is currently producing
recycled water with a higher than average salinity content, which is affecting the overall quality and usability of recycled water for certain applications. The current sewage treatment process used
by the City is not effective at removing salinity.
Several neighboring cities have been successful at reducing salinity and treatment costs by identifying and correcting sources of groundwater I&I. The first phase of this project will conduct a
feasibility study to identify sanitary sewer pipe segments where I&I is occurring. Conductivity monitors are deployed at strategic locations in the collection system where I&I is suspected. The
information collected by conductivity meters identifies pipe segments where high salinity is occurring, which is generally indicative of an I&I source. Pipe segments are typically recommended to
be rehabilitated to eliminate the I&I source. The most common method of pipe rehabilitation to correct I&I sources is cured in place pipe lining (CIPP), but replacement and/or spot repairs may be
necessary as well.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will identify sources of groundwater I&I, which may be affecting the quality of recycled water produced by the WPCP. The sanitary sewer collection system and the WPCP stand to
benefit from this project by improving recycled water quality and reducing treatment costs associated with additional hydraulic loading. The reliability of the collection should also be improved as
capacity in the system will be increased with the reduction of the additional hydraulic loading.
Failing to undertake this project would result in increased treatment costs to improve recycled water quality. It could also result in illicit sewage discharges from the sanitary sewer collection system
due to hydraulic overloading which would have adverse public health and environmental impacts, as well as result in regulatory penalties and fines.

This project provides funding to accommodate additional sewer main capacity required for build-out of the Moffett Park area and is also identified as a required mitigation in the Moffett Park
Specific Plan, which was adopted by the Sunnyvale City Council on April 27, 2004 (111-04). The expected useful life of the replaced sewer lines is 50 years. This project will replace approximately
7,000 feet of existing sanitary sewer main lines ranging in size from 8” to 24”. The piping associated with this project was identified to be upgraded in the Moffett Park Specific Plan and is
necessary to convey anticipated additional hydraulic loading of the sanitary sewer system due to development in the area. The FY 2015/16 and FY 2016/17 budgets fund the design of the project
and the FY 2016/17 budget includes construction costs.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

Not upgrading the lines will result in sewer capacity problems once the developments in the area take place. The project is a place holder. The actual timing of the project will depend on the future
development of the area.

Fiscal Impact

The project is currently unfunded. The City may be reimbursed for some of these upgrading costs by future developments in the area.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will correct the sources of direct Inflow and Infiltration (I&I) of ground water into the sanitary sewer collection system. I&I contributes to additional hydraulic loading in the collection
system which increases treatment costs as well as reduces design collection system conveyance capacity. I&I causes poor recycled water quality. The City is currently producing recycled water with
a higher than average salinity content, which is affecting the overall quality and usability of recycled water for certain applications. The current sewage treatment process the City uses is not
effective with removing salinity.

t
c
e
j
o

Several neighboring cities have been successful with reducing salinity and treatment costs by identifying and correcting sources of groundwater I&I. The first phase of this project will conduct a
feasibility study to identify sanitary sewer pipe segments where I&I is occurring. Conductivity monitors are deployed at strategic locations in the collection system where I&I is suspected. The
information collected by conductivity meters identifies pipe segments where high salinity is occurring which is generally indicative of an I&I source. Pipe segments are typically recommended to be
rehabilitated to eliminate the I&I source. The most common method of pipe rehabilitation to correct I&I sources is cured in place pipe lining (CIPP), but replacement and/or spot repairs may be
necessary as well.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

This project is dependent on a sanitary sewer salinity study that is scheduled for FY 2013/14. The sanitary sewer collection system and the WPCP stand to benefit from this project by improving
recycled water quality and reducing treatment costs associated with additional hydraulic loading. The reliability of the collection should also be improved as capacity in the system will be increased
with the reduction of the additional hydraulic loading.
Not doing this project would result in increased treatment costs to improve recycled water quality. It could also result in illicit sewage discharges from the sanitary sewer collection system due to
hydraulic overloading which would have adverse public health and environmental impacts, as well as result in regulatory penalties and fines.

This project is unfunded pending the results of the salinity study.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding to plan, design, and construct one or more retrofit projects that redirect stormwater from public rights of way to biotreatment areas (essentially, landscaped areas
designed specifically to treat and retain a stormwater runoff). The target areas would most likely be public streets, the runoff from which currently goes to the storm drain system and creeks without
treatment. Target areas may also include the retrofit of public parking areas.

t
c
e
j
o

Project Evaluation and Analysis

The current stormwater permit requires 10 "green street" pilots to occur across the Bay Area, and Sunnyvale is not currently one of the cities implementing such a project. Instead, Sunnyvale shares
very limited costs associated with implementing and monitoring green streets projects in the county as required by the stormwater permit. While roadways are among the most polluted of paved
surfaces carrying pollutants to creeks, the current permit requires stormwater treatment only for new streets which are part of larger development projects and for streets that are widened to add
traffic lanes. It is expected that the next permit (FY 2014/2015) will require broader implementation of stormwater treatment for streets. This proposal positions the City to be responsive by
beginning retrofits of existing roadway areas. Such projects may also be an "alternative compliance" option for private development projects that have difficulty meeting the stormwater
requirements on the project site.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for roof replacement at the Public Safety and Fire Station buildings. Replacement of the Public Safety Building roof was completed in FY 2011/12. The useful life of the
Public Safety building roof is 40 years.
The next phase of this project is replacing tar and gravel roofs for six fire stations with cool roofs. A portion of the funding in FY 2012/13 was used for scoping and design of the fire station roofs.
Roof replacement is scheduled for FY 2013/14. The useful life for cool roofs is 20 years.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Replacement of the six fire stations' roofs began in FY 2012/13, and will be completed in FY 2013/14. Each fire station roof will be evaluated and replaced if necessary. The necessary replacements
will be coordinated to maximize cost efficiency. The remaining funding will be carried over and used for replacement of remaining roofs as needed.
No additional operating costs are generated as a result of this project.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the replacement of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for the Public Safety buildings. The Public Safety Building mechanical system was replaced
in FY 2011/12. Remaining systems due for replacement are in the six fire houses. Systems requiring replacement are identified by inspections and manufacturer specifications on equipment life
spans.
Funds budgeted in FY 2031/32 are for the replacement of the newly installed HVAC system in the Public Safety building. The budget includes design, inspection and construction.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Remaining work for this project includes the replacement of HVAC systems in the six fire houses. The replacement schedule is based on the age of the systems and data gathered from Facilities
work order system. The data indicate that systems in Fire Stations 1 & 5 should be replaced in FY 2013/14, with Fire Stations 4 & 6 in FY 2014/15 and Fire Stations 2 & 3 in FY 2015/16. This
equipment will have an expected life of 20 years. If the project is not completed, users of the buildings will experience discomfort, and the energy efficiency of the equipment will continue to
decline.

Fiscal Impact

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Department of Public Safety has completed a comprehensive staffing analysis to plan for the recruitment, selection, and training of new officers over the next 20 years. This project provides
funding for salaries and recruiting expenses (e.g., testing materials, psychological evaluations, academy tuition, study materials, etc.) for recruitment, selection, and training of new Public Safety
Officers. Requested funding is a placeholder for future recruitment and training costs to support hiring of sworn staff for the Department of Public Safety.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
It is anticipated that funding the selection and hiring of new Public Safety Officers would have little or no service level impact.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This grant funds overtime expenses associated with DUI enforcement through saturation patrols on specified major holidays. Recipient agencies are required to report all DUI-related arrests to both
the Santa Clara County Sheriff and the California Highway Patrol each day of the designated campaigns. Saturation patrols are required during the winter holidays (December/January) and during
the late summer (August/September). Additional authorized saturation patrols can be conducted on holidays including, but not limited to, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Superbowl Sunday, St. Patrick’
s Day, Cinco de Mayo, and Fourth of July.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Since 2005, the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office has received a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety to fund the Avoid the 13 DUI enforcement campaigns. Because the FY 2011/12
allocation was finalized late in the fiscal year, the County confirmed that the City could utilize its FY 2011/2012 allocation ($7,070) and its FY 2012/13 allocation ($9,600) all during the the current
FY 2012/13. Thus, the total current allocation for the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety (DPS) is $16,670.
The mission of the Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) is to obtain and effectively administer traffic safety grant funds to reduce deaths, injuries, and economic losses resulting from traffic-related
collisions. Each year OTS offers grant funds to law enforcement agencies to cover overtime expenses associated with DUI enforcement. Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office coordinates regional
campaigns and allocates grant dollars to cities in Santa Clara County to conduct saturation patrols.

Fiscal Impact
This project is fully funded by OTS grant funds.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City of Sunnyvale applied for the Assistance to Firefighters (AFG) grant on behalf of the Silicon Valley Regional Interoperability Authority (SVRIA) member agencies of Milpitas, Palo Alto,
Santa Clara (City) and Santa Clara County Fire in order to augment any gaps in available Stage 1 funding and to help facilitate SVRCS build-out into the next phase. A total of $1,386,000 was
awarded to Sunnyvale by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for 275 radios, to be proportionately shared among the partnering fire agencies according to the number of radios needed.
The grant requires a $346,500 local match (for a grand total of $1,732,500 or 80% grant/20% local match), again to be shared according to need.
Sunnyvale will be responsible for grant administration/compliance, but the County will purchase the radios. As the direct recipient of the grant award, Sunnyvale will be responsible for reimbursing
the County 100% of AFG award and collecting the 20% local match from the participating agencies. This arrangement is incorporated into the total amount to be reimbursed by Sunnyvale to the
County.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The total contract with the County will not exceed $3,972,856. This amount is broken down into the following components:
- $2,518,546 for portables/radios and 911 consoles for the City of Sunnyvale’s Departments of Public Safety and Public Works. This will be funded by a combination of AFG funds and budgeted
equipment replacement funds.
- $320,310 for a project contingency for the aforementioned project. If needed, this will be funded by a combination of AFG funds and budgeted equipment replacement funds.
- $1,134,000 for reimbursements for equipment purchased under this contract for other jurisdictions. This will be funded entirely by AFG funds and local match funds from the other jurisdictions.
The Bureau of Special Operations, Division of Strategic Services will be responsible for deployment of equipment and managing the grant.

Fiscal Impact
Because the city's local match is being covered by the equipment replacement funds previously set aside for this project, there is no net fiscal impact to the City for accepting and appropriating these
grant funds.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The mission of the Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) is to obtain and effectively administer traffic safety grant funds to reduce deaths, injuries, and economic losses resulting from traffic related
collisions. Each year OTS, through its partnership with the Traffic Safety Center at University of California, Berkeley, offers grant funds to law enforcement agencies to cover overtime expenses
associated with the operation of sobriety checkpoints.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
These funds will be for reimbursable expenditures that will occur in FY 2013/14. As per grant guidelines, the funds will cover overtime expenses associated with the operation of two sobriety
checkpoints between October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014. OTS requires one occur during the winter holidays (December/January) and one during the Labor Day holiday (August/September).
The grant also will cover up to $2,500 in equipment related to safely conducting the checkpoints.

Fiscal Impact
There is no net impact to the General Fund by appropriating these grant funds. This grant will pay for overtime expenses associated with the operation of two sobriety checkpoints to between
October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014. Expenditures for each OTS approved checkpoint are reimbursable up to $7,500 with a cumulative total of $15,000.
An additional $2,500 has been granted to DPS to purchase equipment that will enhance the operations at the checkpoint. Items include traffic cones; signage; reflective vests for personnel; LED
light wands; and LED road flares. There is no maintenance costs associated with the equipment which will be purchased through this grant. Additional grant funds will be sought to replace the
equipment when they reach the end of their useful life.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) are dedicated federal grants for front-line police services. The Department of Public Safety (DPS) has been applying for and accepting these grants since 1996.
From 1996 through 2005, they were called Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants (Byrne Grants). In 2006, the name was changed to JAG. Since FY 2011/12, the JAG monies have
been dedicated to purchasing equipment. In prior years, this funding was used to supplement front-line patrol in the Traffic Unit. Realignment within DPS necessitated the requested change in use.
OJP/BJA approved the change as a condition of accepting the grant funds.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
These funds will be for reimbursable expenditures that will occur in FY 2013/14. Expenditures will be for OJP/BJA approved equipment, including tactical gear and supplies needed by front-line
patrol. Specific uses will be for tactical binoculars and other specialized equipment for the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team, as well as consumable supplies needed for force-on-force
training and initial taser training.

Fiscal Impact
There is no net impact to the General Fund by appropriating these grant funds. Standard grant guidelines require that equipment purchased with grant funds must be maintained by the grantee
through the useful life of the equipment. Maintenance costs for the identified equipment are expected to be minimal and will be absorbed within the existing DPS budget. This technology has an
expected useful life of five to seven years. When it becomes obsolete or surpasses its useful life, grant funds will be sought for replacement.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
DPS’ Bureau of Patrol Services, Division of Traffic Safety identified bicycle and pedestrian safety as an area of focus. OTS statistics showed bicycle and pedestrian accidents
ranked only second to driving under the influence (DUI) arrests in Sunnyvale. This grant will be used to increase the safety of residents as they participate in new programs like Safe Routes to
Schools, Communities Putting Prevention to Work Obesity Reduction Initiatives, and even Bicycle Parties. All of these programs promote and encourage Sunnyvale’s citizens of all ages to “get
moving” by bicycle and as pedestrians. DPS applauds these efforts and initiatives; however, the increase in pedestrians and bicyclists requires increased community policing efforts. These efforts
are a multi-faceted, holistic approach to reducing motor on pedestrian and motor on bicycle accidents in Sunnyvale.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This grant provides funding for two bicycle rodeos, enhanced educational outreach, bicycle helmets and other bicycle safety items for low-income elementary and middle school students. The grant
also provides funding for DPS personnel to conduct additional focused enforcement at high risk intersections and corridors.

Fiscal Impact
These funds will be for reimbursable expenditures that will occur prior to 10/01/14. Expenditures for California Office of Traffic Safety approved activities are reimbursable up to the $50,000
appropriation.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Since 2005, the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office has received a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety to fund the Avoid the 13 Driving Under the Influence (DUI) enforcement
campaigns. For FY 2013/14, the Sheriff’s Office has awarded $16,000 to Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety (DPS) to conduct saturation patrols for DUI offenders. Saturation patrols are a
type of targeted enforcement. Specifically, officers are deployed, generally in teams, with a priority focus of identifying and stopping individuals who are operating a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol or drugs.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This grant provides funding for overtime expenses associated with DUI enforcement through saturation patrols on specified major holidays. Recipient agencies are required to report all DUI related
arrests to both the Santa Clara County Sheriff and the California Highway Patrol. Saturation patrols are required during the winter holidays (Dec/Jan) and during the late summer (Aug/Sep).
Additional authorized saturation patrols can be conducted on other holidays or special event days (Superbowl Sunday, Cinco de Mayo, Fourth of July, etc.).

Fiscal Impact
These funds will be for reimbursable expenditures that will occur prior to 10/01/14. Expenditures for California Office of Traffic Safety approved AVOID the 13 activities, including overtime is
reimbursable up to the $16,000 appropriation.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Sunnyvale's Department of Public Safety (DPS) and all public safety agencies in Santa Clara County have been working with the Silicon Valley Regional Interoperability Authority (SVRIA) and
Santa Clara County Communications Department (County COMM) to continue deploying interoperable radio infrastructure. County COMM serves as SVRIA’s authorized fiscal agent and project
manager for the Stage 1 build-out. Sunnyvale DPS serves as the partnering agency administrator for the AFG grant portion of the Stage 1 implementation agreement.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City of Sunnyvale applied for a 2012 AFG grant on behalf of the SVRIA member agencies of Santa Clara County Fire Department, South Santa Clara County Fire District, Gilroy, Milpitas,
Palo Alto, San Jose, Santa Clara City, and Sunnyvale in 2013. On October 25, 2013, the City Manager accepted Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management
(FEMA) Assistance to Firefighters (AFG) grant funds (including regional matching funds) in the amount of $895,409 to the Department of Public Safety. This will supplement the 2011 AFG grant
that was appropriated as part of the funding for the initial Stage 1 contract approved by Council in 2012. These additional AFG funds also will help facilitate the Silicon Valley Regional
Communication System build-out into the next phase.

Fiscal Impact
On October 25, 2013, the City Manager accepted Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Assistance to Firefighters grant funds (including regional matching funds) in
the amount of $895,409 to the Department of Public Safety. The total amount of $895,409 is comprised of 80% in federal funds ($716,927) and requires a 20% local match ($178,482) by the
participating agencies. All federal funding and local match will be shared according
to need. Of the total local match required, Sunnyvale’s share is $2,217 and will be covered by the equipment replacement funds previously set aside for this project.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

This space requirement is based upon the Civic Center Master Plan Study conducted in 2003 at the direction of the City Council. This project's scope, schedule, and preliminary cost estimates are a
placeholder. Based on the results of the Citywide Facilities Plan, this project will be further developed.

Fiscal Impact

This project is currently unfunded. After this project is more fully developed, funding sources will need to be explored. In addition, this project will expand the size of the Public Safety building by
9,000 square feet and will cause a corresponding increase in the operating cost. The operating cost requirement will need to be evaluated prior to the project launch.

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
Each year, the City of Sunnyvale submits an Action
Plan to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD). This plan allows the City to
receive entitlement funds under the Community
Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) and the
HOME Program. CDBG and HOME funds are used to
finance specific and targeted activities, including
outside group service agencies, as well as housing
facilities and home loans for seniors and people with
low to moderate incomes. These grant funds can also
be used for projects targeting Americans with
Disabilities (ADA) compliance and for projects in
defined low-income census tract areas.

Outside Group Funding. This project allocates CDBG
funds to support outside agencies that address
community needs. The agencies and the annual
funding amount awarded to each agency are
determined by Council each year. The CDBG allocation
is budgeted at $198,000 annually, supplemented by up
to $100,000 of General Fund support, which is shown
as a separate project in the Outside Group Funding
project category.
Home Access, Paint, Emergency Repair and Energy
Efficiency. Low-income households receive assistance
under this program through grants for exterior paint
and emergency repairs, as well as for retrofit and
maintenance of units occupied by disabled persons. In
addition, the program offers dollar-for-dollar matching
grants for energy efficiency retrofits.

Major CDBG Projects
Each year, staff prepares the City’s Consolidated
Housing Plan and the FY 2014/15 plan includes the
following major projects:

Sunnyvale Workforce Development Program. This
program, carried out by Sunnyvale Community
Services, a non-profit corporation, will provide job
readiness training, job skills training, and job
placement for at least fifty low-income individuals who
are homeless, recently homeless, or at risk of
homelessness in Sunnyvale.

ADA Curb Retrofit. This project provides CDBG funds
to accelerate sidewalk accessibility construction, as
many intersections within the City require pedestrian
access improvements in order to comply with ADA
standards for accessibility.

1119

Housing Rehabilitation Revolving Loan Fund. The
Revolving Loan Fund provides for rehabilitation and
repair of single-family and multi-family homes. It also
provides an option for extremely low-income
individuals to defer their rehabilitation loan repayment
until the owner passes away or the property is sold or
transferred. While the original financing was federal
CDBG monies, the project receives continual funding
from the proceeds of loan repayments.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Community Development Strategy directed the City to concentrate resources on stimulating substantial rehabilitation and modernization of multi-family units. This project provides
rehabilitation loans to existing rental properties that serve households at 30% to 80% of Area Median Income, with rents limited to 30% of gross household income. Substantial rehabilitation of
rental properties includes repairs to the exterior of the structure, the major component systems and the interior functional components. The CDBG Housing Rehabilitation Revolving Loan Fund
(RLF) allows CDBG rehabilitation loans to "revolve". Program income earned from repayments of existing loans are disbursed as new loans.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project includes rehabilitation of single family homes owned by low income residents and multi-family properties occupied by low-income tenants.

Fiscal Impact
The US Department of Housing and Urban Development's lead based paint requirements may increase the cost of each rehabilitation project. This may result in fewer projects being completed,
given the limited funding available. Project expenditures are funded by program income received during the program year and prior years.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $65,000 in CDBG funds that will provide assistance to approximately 15 low-income households. Funds will be used for the following activities:
1) Home Access - provides grants of up to $6,500 to retrofit and maintain units occupied by disabled persons;
2) Paint Program - provides assistance to homeowners to paint the exterior of their homes;
3) Emergency Repair - provides grants of up to $2,500 for life-threatening building hazards, such as electrical system failures, unsound structures, plumbing system failures, and/or other conditions
which could result in an explosion or unsafe situation in the immediate future; and
4) Energy Efficiency Program - provides dollar for dollar matching grants up to $10,000 for energy efficiency retrofits.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project addresses the priorities and goals described in the Consolidated Plan, specifically, Affordable Housing: "Improve housing accessibility, housing conditions, lead-based paint hazard
reduction, energy efficiency, and affordability for lower-income households."

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an annual expenditure from the CDBG Fund (110/100). This use of CDBG funds is consistent with federal regulations governing use of that fund.

Suzanne Ise

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project allocates $322,000 in CDBG funds to Sunnyvale Community Services, a non-profit corporation. Funds will be used to implement a Sunnyvale Workforce Development Program in
partnership with Downtown Streets Team, a non-profit based in Palo Alto. This program will provide job readiness training, job skills training, and job placement for at least fifty low-income
individuals who are homeless, recently homeless, or at risk of homelessness in Sunnyvale.
Sunnyvale Community Services has been certified as a Community-Based Development Organization (CBDO) which allows it to apply for CDBG funds for programs that are not subject to the
CDBG 15% public services cap. These activities include programs that are designed to increase economic opportunities through job training and placement and other employment support services,
including, but not limited to, temporary housing assistance, child care, transportation, and supportive services. The proposed Workforce Development Program qualifies for CDBG funding under
this category of activities.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This program would address the Consolidated Plan objective to help people who are currently homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness to obtain employment or other sources of income and
adequate support services/networks to obtain housing and achieve stability. Although this is a new program for Sunnyvale, both agencies have a very strong track record and strong organizational
capacity, and the program addresses a priority community need.

Fiscal Impact
This project will require an expenditure of up to $322,000 from the CDBG Fund. Use of these funds are consistent with federal regulations governing use of CDBG funds.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to accelerate sidewalk accessibility construction to meet ADA standards. Pedestrian access improvements are needed at
many intersections within the City to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards for accessibility.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project provides additional funds to accelerate curb ramp construction to meet ADA standards. This project also addresses the priorities and goals described in the City’s 2010-2015
Consolidated Plan, specifically “Maintain/Expand Community Facilities and Infrastructure". One of the main objectives is for the City to continue the curb retrofit program to improve accessibility

Fiscal Impact
This project will continue as long as CDBG revenues are available to the City. If this funding source is lost then the City will pursue other outside grant options or re-evaluate the level of service
provided. However, should funding appropriation be reduced, the funding for this project may be proportionately reduced. This project will require an expenditure from the CDBG Fund of up to
$200,000 in FY 2014/15 and $300,000 every three years, beginning in FY 17/18. Use of these funds are consistent with federal regulations governing use of CDBG funds.

Outside Group Funding
The City of Sunnyvale has, for decades, provided
supplemental
support
to
its
economically
disadvantaged residents through funding of local
human services agencies. The principal source of
funding is the Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG). Over the years, the City has supplemented
federal funding with General Fund support at varying
levels.

request using General Fund monies; or 3) do not
recommend funding the request.
For human services agencies, their requests are
processed together with their requests for CDBG funds.
In December 2008, Council approved a maximum
General Fund support level of $100,000 annually. A
combined maximum of $350,000 in CDBG and General
Funds was set for CDBG-eligible human services
agencies. Therefore, General Fund support could go up
and down annually depending on the CDBG allocation,
but will be no more $100,000.

In years past, General Fund monies were allocated
based on a set dollar amount through an outside group
funding process. There were two types of groups that
competed for the funds through this process: human
services agencies, which were also eligible for CDBG
funding, and outside groups that provided community
enrichment services such as promotion of community
engagement and job training. Starting in FY 2008/09,
the process was separated for these two group types.

Outside Group Funding Projects
The CDBG allocation is expected to be $198,000 in FY
2014/15.
This allocation is supplemented by
$100,000 of General Fund support.

For outside groups not eligible for CDBG funds, groups
must make funding requests directly to the City
department in which their services would reside. Staff
considers these requests in context of their operating
budgets and currently funded service levels. Staff then
makes one of three recommendations to Council: 1)
fund the request within the existing budget by
reducing or eliminating another service; 2) fund the

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides one-time funding for dispute resolution and mediation services by an entity qualified to provide such services. The focus of this service is on tenant/landlord disputes, but other
types of community disputes would also be accommodated to the extent possible. Sunnyvale has a long tradition of supporting tenant/landlord mediation and dispute resolution services to help local
renters and landlords, as well as other community members, resolve disputes in an amicable manner.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project provides an increased level of service to the community by providing dispute resolution services that are frequently requested by residents, property owners and other related agencies.
For many years, the City funded dispute resolution services provided by an outside agency; however, the General Fund allocation for these services was discontinued in 2010. Since that time, staff
has received increasing number of requests for assistance with community disputes. Although the County of Santa Clara offers a community mediation program, they have reported that they do not
have the capacity to handle the volume of calls they have been receiving over the past few years. For FY 2013/14, the City approved $20,000 to restore this service as part of Budget Supplement #5.

Fiscal Impact
As part of the budget adoption on June 24, 2014, Council approved a total of $45,000 in one-time funding for FY 2014/15 to continue professional dispute resolution services. $20,000 was approved
as part of Budget Supplement #1, with an additional $25,000 approved from the Council Set Aside (Project 829630). This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for infrastructure repairs and renovations to existing park buildings. This may include repair/replacement of flooring, window coverings, fixtures, HVAC, roofs, and other
work required to keep existing structures in a safe, usable, and attractive condition. These projects are evaluated and prioritized according to applicable codes, safety issues, and relationships to
other rehabilitation projects that may trigger work to the buildings such as playground renovations or ADA upgrades to restrooms.
Funds in FY 2013/14 were to complete Murphy Park and Orchard Gardens Park recreation building renovations (restrooms only) and to complete roof work initiated in FY 2012/13 at various park
buildings. FY 2014/15 and FY 2015/16 funds are for the design and renovation of Washington, Raynor, De Anza, Ponderosa Parks recreation buildings and two auxiliary restrooms - Washington
Park's Jelcick Field and De Anza Park. Funds for FY 2020/21 and FY 2021/22 are for design and construction of Panama, Encinal and Fairwood Park restroom buildings and needed HVAC and
roof repair/replacement at various park buildings. Funds in FY 2022/23 and FY 2028/29 are also for HVAC and roof repair/replacement at various park buildings.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
All park buildings were included in a building assessment completed in 2000 when all components were evaluated and assigned replacement dates. Since then, Facilities staff has continued to
renovate and repair park buildings and components as needed. Each year all structures are re-evaluated, and project prioritization and scope of work may change depending upon current building
conditions. Delay in these projects may result in higher operational costs due to higher frequency of repairs and/or higher capital costs for emergency replacement. Staff estimates are based on costs
from previous renovations and include program coordination and contingencies.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for upgrades to building systems and ongoing electrical, HVAC, and roof rehabilitation of the Senior Center to maintain its operational effectiveness in future years. Funds in
FY 2013/14 are an estimate for evaluation and repair/replacement of the building’s public address system. The system is used to make emergency evacuation announcements by the Fire
Department, building wide paging calls by staff, and individual meeting room sound reinforcement for public speakers, musical presentations, and room rentals requiring a sound system. Currently,
the sound system is not fully functional and in some applications does not work at all. Funds in FY 2017/18 are for replacement of the automatic doors. Funds in FY 2022/23 and FY 2023/24 are
for design and construction of HVAC component replacement, solar panel replacement, and flat roof surface replacement.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The existing building requires ongoing maintenance and repair of electrical and mechanical components to remain operationally effective.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund. There are no additional operational costs resulting from this project.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for replacement of computer/radio controlled irrigation equipment on City medians and roadside landscape areas throughout the City. Normally, the replacement of cabinets,
one central controller, 74 satellite controllers, and software is performed at an average interval of 15 years; however, the majority of the existing system is beyond the interval and in need of
replacement.
Replacement of approximately 50 satellite controllers, 4 weather stations, 19 flow meters, and the central control system and operating software will occur in FY 2017/18. Six controllers will be
replaced each year from FY 2018/19 through FY 2021/22. The replacement cycle will commence again in FY 2032/33.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The manufacturer has discontinued the models currently in use and is no longer providing support for them. The satellite controllers are failing and the repair costs in both labor and materials have
increased. In some cases the units are not repairable and have been placed offline. Repair and replacement of equipment will save water, reduce the need for emergency repairs, and improve the
reliability of the system. The replacement schedule will be evaluated and extended as necessary.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the reconstruction of 32 City-owned tennis and basketball courts and does not include the 16 tennis courts at the Sunnyvale Tennis Center, which are included in a separate
project. Based on historical data, usage, and current surveys, major reconstruction and repair for each court is required approximately every 30 years. Reconstruction will include surfacing, fencing,
and hardware as appropriate. Cost estimates are based on recent projects at the Sunnyvale Tennis Center.
Funds budgeted in FY 2013/14 provided for reconstruction of two tennis courts and two basketball courts at Washington Park, two tennis courts at Orchard Gardens, and two tennis courts and ½
basketball court at Encinal Park. Funds in FY 2017/18 are for two tennis courts and one basketball court at Ponderosa Park, and two tennis courts at Braly Park. Funds in FY 2021/22 are for two
tennis courts at Columbia Park/School. Funds programmed for reconstruction beyond FY 2021/22 have not been earmarked for specific courts at this time.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain existing recreational infrastructure. Alternatives to funding this project would be to allow the courts to deteriorate (which would result in hazardous and
unusable courts) or to reduce costs by eliminating a portion of the project’s scope (hardware, resurfacing, fencing).

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the replacement of parks playground equipment, resilient surfacing, and related site work. Replacement priorities are determined by an annual survey of all park
playgrounds by staff that are Certified Playground Safety Inspectors, and the replacement schedule is coordinated with other major park rehabilitation projects.
The replacement schedule is as follows, with design being done in the year preceding construction: Las Palmas Park FY 2013/14; Orchard Gardens (elementary-age playground only), Fairwood
(elementary-age playground only), and Braly Parks in FY 2015/16; Washington, Victory Village, Encinal (elementary-age playground only), and Greenwood Manor Parks in FY 2019/20; Columbia
Park/School, Cupertino Middle School, and Cannery Park in FY 2023/24. The replacement of equipment at other sites is included in the scope of new park renovation/enhancement projects.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project maintains existing service levels by replacing worn equipment. The alternative to replacement is to increase or decrease the replacement cycle to result in increased or decreased costs.
These options would also result in either improved or diminished quality of playground equipment available for play.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the scheduled replacement/renovation of the irrigation systems at Sunnyvale and Sunken Garden Golf Courses. All components of the systems including central and
satellite irrigation controllers, main and lateral lines/piping, flow meters, pumps, wiring, valves, and heads are included, as well as any needed design changes to the system configuration and
components. The central computer and all controllers are to be replaced every 15 years, and all other irrigation components are to be replaced every 30 years, as needed. Scope is determined by an
annual staff survey and by the architectural consultant during the design phase.
Project design is scheduled for FY 2016/17 and construction in FY 2017/18.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain existing service levels. Not completing this project would result in irrigation system failures and dead turf, resulting in declining revenues from green fees.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the replacement of tee grounds at the Sunnyvale Golf Course and Sunken Gardens Golf Course. Tee ground replacements are planned every 15 years based upon expected
life cycles as provided by the American Society of Golf Course Architects. Work performed in this project will maintain Council-approved service levels for safe, attractive, and usable golf
courses. Funds budgeted in FY 2022/23 and FY 2023/24 are for the design and construction of Sunnyvale and Sunken Gardens Golf Courses. The cost estimates are based on comparable projects
currently being completed by local golf course contractors, and the recently completed project at Sunnyvale Golf Course.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain existing essential infrastructure that is critical to golf course operations and the overall play of both courses.
While the completion of these projects will help maintain the level of service for our customers, staff does not anticipate that this project will increase future revenues. Depending on the timing and
phasing of the projects there will be some impact on play, and there may be a time period when reduced green fees are recommended because of the project impacts.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the replacement and/or repair of pool infrastructure and related components as necessary, based upon annual inspections by City staff.
This project includes equipment replacement for diving boards, pumps and other miscellaneous items, and also includes renovations such as pool relining, pool deck resurfacing, and pool boiler
heater replacement for the City-owned Washington Pool, the leased pool at Columbia Middle School, and the leased pool at Sunnyvale Middle School.
Higher than average funding amounts are included in Fiscal Years 2013/14, 2017/18, 2027/28, and 2031/32 to accommodate the replacement of larger items such as pool liners, decks, and boilers at
the various pools.
Per agreement with the Sunnyvale School District, the District pays for 50% of all maintenance and equipment replacement for Columbia Middle School Pool. The reimbursement from the shared
cost is reflected in the cost estimates. Funds are not allocated for Washington Pool past FY 2018/19 due to construction of the Washington Pool enhancement project that year.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Regular maintenance, capital replacement, and routine upgrades to pool infrastructure components will allow the pools to operate in a safe and healthy manner.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund, with some offsetting contributions from the School District.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the complete replacement and enhancement of the Washington Pool complex including pool, deck, and buildings. It will significantly improve recreational swim, water
play, and therapeutic opportunities for the community through the use of features such as zero depth entry, water play equipment, slides, and wading areas. Included in the scope of work are
modifications to the surrounding park areas that will be needed due to the expanding footprint of the pool complex.
On November 19, 2013 (RTC 13-275), Council authorized the $14.05 million sale and purchase agreement between the City of Sunnyvale and Stratford School, Inc. for the Raynor Activity Center.
Upon close of escrow, they directed that proceeds of approximately $2.37 million be used for the design and construction of the Washington Pool Expansion project. This would advance the project
schedule by one year to start in FY 2015/16. Funds programmed in FY 2016/17 and FY 2017/18 are for design. Funds in FY 2018/19 and FY 2019/20 are for construction.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
All pool complex facilities including the pool, deck, bleacher/equipment building, and locker room building are in need of significant renovation or replacement. There are swimming pool facilities
elsewhere in the community that meet the needs for lap and competitive swimming. However, there is no aquatic facility available that has a focus on recreational swimming, water play, and
therapeutic uses. It is necessary to replace the existing facility for the Washington Pool complex to maintain and increase its value to the community for both programmed and unstructured
activities.

Fiscal Impact
This project will be funded by both the General Fund and Park Dedication Fund. Using some of the proceeds from the sale of the Raynor Activity Center would allow the project to be advanced by
one year and free up approximately $2.37 million of the $6.6 million currently budgeted from Park Dedication Fees for other park capital project needs or land acquisition.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for epoxy sealing and line painting of sixteen courts at the Sunnyvale Tennis Center every 5 years. The project schedule is for all courts to be completed in FY 2017/18 and
every 5 years thereafter.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project protects existing service levels, facilities, and revenue to the City. Maintaining the condition of the tennis court surfaces will enable the contract operator to continue offering
recreational play, lessons, and competition at the Sunnyvale Tennis Center and will maintain revenue to the City (per license agreement), which totals approximately $100,000 annually.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the renovation and replacement of existing storm drains in all City parks parking lots. It replaces dated storm drain piping with upgraded pipe that should mitigate
problems such as tree roots. After replacing storm drain piping, parking lots will be resurfaced with an asphalt overlay. Paving work will be performed on a 20-year cycle. Replacement priorities are
determined by an extensive survey and review of the condition of all park parking lots. Staff updates the survey each year and adjusts planning based on actual conditions of the drains and the lots.
In addition, the renovation schedule is coordinated with other major park renovation projects.
The anticipated construction costs vary by park due to the size and condition of the parking lot. Drain replacement/repair and asphalt overlay are currently planned for the following parks in FY
2015/16 and FY 2016/17: Ponderosa, De Anza, Murphy, Braly, Washington, Raynor, and Panama. Other sites are in good condition. Work needed at other sites has been included in the scopes of
the new park renovation/enhancement projects.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Without renovation and replacement, the parking lot surfacing and drainage systems deteriorate, eventually becoming unusable, prone to flooding, and potentially hazardous. In addition, as
asphalt/concrete ages it fragments, causing debris and litter. Postponement of the project could result in higher costs due to continued deterioration.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund and the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the expansion of the Senior Center's Fitness Room by adding 1,000 square feet to the building's footprint to accommodate the room's increased use due to the growth in
popularity of this room. The Fitness Room is currently 900 square feet and filled to capacity with exercise equipment and the demand for usage is still growing.
Funds in FY 2022/23 are for design and funds in FY 2023/24 are for construction. An additional $50,000 is included in the budget for initial purchase of additional fitness room equipment. This
equipment is expected to have a useful life of 10 years. Cost estimates are based on current per square foot construction cost. Additional square footage will add to existing operational costs to
maintain this space and to maintain and replace fitness room equipment.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The fitness room of the Senior Center is a very popular and well used amenity. The current space is reaching design capacities and it is expected that popularity of the activities will grow. This
project addresses projected future growth and will address shortcomings now experienced by users. The expanded space will allow for additional exercise units and will address user concerns
regarding long waits for equipment. The additional space will also enable staff to design a room layout that facilitates grouping of exercise-specific equipment and allows for participant stretching
spaces.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a level paved area around the clubhouse at Sunken Gardens Golf Course. Currently there is a variety of paving types with numerous patches from different
work performed over the years that are not level or consistent.
The estimated cost is based on current Public Works contract costs of $3 per square foot for 15,000 feet of asphalt and $10 per square foot for 2,000 feet of concrete for a total estimated cost of
$65,000.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The paved areas around the clubhouse at Sunken Gardens Golf Course have been cut through and patched numerous times resulting in a variety of materials and numerous small changes in
elevation around the building. In addition to being a visual distraction, these variations in textures and heights create an increased potential for injury around the building. This has been noted in
annual City-wide safety inspections for several years. This project creates a more uniform surface, minimizing the potential for any future accidents, and improving the overall appearance of the
area.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by Park Dedication fees.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the repair or replacement of building infrastructure at the Tennis Center including electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, walls, roofs, and foundations. Needed work is
determined by inspections conducted by staff of Parks and Facilities Services. Cost estimates are based upon recent work completed as part of the Park Building Infrastructure project.
Funds in FY 2013/14 were for the replacement of roofs, and repair of dry rot and termite damage.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
In FY 2011/12 a license agreement was approved with a new private operator to manage the Tennis Center. As part of the agreement, the operator was required to make a capital investment in the
building infrastructure, including roof replacement. Although a significant amount of work was done, including the renovation of all building interiors to make them code and ADA compliant, there
were only enough funds for temporary roof repairs.
This project is necessary to maintain existing essential infrastructure. The roof of the tennis center is 30 years old and is in need of replacement.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for infrastructure renovation and repair of two community swimming pool buildings: the City-owned Washington Pool and the pool at Columbia Middle School. Facilities at
Washington include the bleacher/pool equipment and locker room buildings. Facilities at Columbia include the office and pool equipment/park maintenance buildings. Equipment on the
replacement schedule includes flooring, paint, restroom fixtures, lighting, plumbing, electrical, and roofing. Specific dollar amounts identified in this project are based on the current replacement
schedule. Over time, some basic infrastructure items deteriorate from use or natural causes (weather, earth movement, etc). This project will replace and/or repair these items as necessary, including
shower valve replacement and plumbing work, ADA equipment replacement, shower tile and grout work, restroom partitions replacement, electrical work, exhaust fan replacement, and interior
painting.
Repairs to the Washington Pool Building shower area, replacement of restroom partitions, and improvements to staff restrooms/showers were completed in FY 2012/13.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
All costs for the listed facilities are the responsibility of the City, and therefore funding for infrastructure repair and renovation must be planned.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the pruning and removal of mature trees at Sunnyvale and Sunken Gardens Golf Courses. The vast majority of the trees have reached maturity and are dead/dying or have
safety issues that must be addressed. Pruning from the ground can no longer be done, so now these trees must be pruned either by climbing or by the use of bucket trucks to ensure employee health
and safety. Typically, this type of "high" tree work is performed by an outside contractor. The required work has grown cumulatively over the last 10 years and has surpassed the ability of the
operating funds to adequately address. Removed trees will be replaced with an appropriate species somewhere on the course grounds to maintain tree inventory at its current level. Costs are based
upon contractor estimates.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project will restore the conditions of the trees to meet established service levels and to ensure the safety of golf course users.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for retrofitting the existing lighting system at the driving range including the electrical panel, wiring, ballasts, and lamps. The current system is over 30 years old, is not energy
efficient, does not provide desired illumination levels, requires frequent repairs, and causes light pollution that is bothersome to nearby neighbors.
Funds in FY 2019/20 are for the replacement of the electrical panel, wiring, ballasts, and lamps. Design and construction costs are based upon a lighting consultant's estimate.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The renovation of this lighting system with new green technology will reduce energy costs by 50% and light pollution by 80%. Illumination levels will be increased to meet industry/sport standards,
thereby providing a safer environment.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The expansion of Orchard Gardens Park includes the demolition of three City-owned homes adjacent to the park on Garner Drive. This area will be replaced with landscaping, benches, lighting,
and concrete pathways and serve as the western “gateway” to the JWC Greenbelt. The City has purchased all adjacent parcels necessary for the park expansion.
Design effort commenced in FY 2012/13. Funds associated with FY 2013/14 are for demolition of the vacant houses and construction of new park amenities and landscaping to expand the park.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The expansion provides for more open space for this neighborhood and is likely to reduce vandalism to the existing park building by creating more visibility into the park's interior from the street.
The project represents an enhancement of existing open space.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund. Ongoing operating cost increases will be funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City has a 25 year lease (with an automatic 10 year extension) that commenced in 2010 with Santa Clara County for the operation of this facility. This project provides for the repair and/or
replacement of infrastructure including irrigation systems, playground equipment, drainage systems, buildings, and asphalt surfaces at Sunnyvale Baylands Park. This project was identified during
the Parks of the Future (POTF) report and needs are determined by annual inspections performed by staff.
FY 2013/14 funds are for replacement of play equipment. FY 2017/18 funds are for replacement of irrigation controllers and renovation of irrigation systems. FY 2022/23 and FY 2023/24 funds
are for design and construction for renovation of parking lots and pathways, and playgrounds. Cost estimates were developed by staff based upon recently completed projects.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Alternatives to funding this project include maintaining the park in its current state and eliminating components as they are no longer useful and safe. For example, one play area has already been
closed and removed due to unsafe conditions and similar steps would be taken throughout the park as components age. Eventually this alternative would significantly change the look and feel of this
park and it would become a more rustic and natural type of park.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide a major renovation of the facility, originally built in 1969, to ensure its sustainability for the future by enhancing recreational usability, increasing attractiveness, and
reducing the use of utilities. Public input meetings will be held during the design phase to gather feedback from neighbors, park users, and other stake holders. The input will be utilized to assist in
determining the scope of work. The current scope includes renovation of recreation and maintenance buildings; replacement of park and building lighting systems with energy efficient fixtures;
replacement of the water play feature; addition of a ½ court basketball court; replacement of portions of landscaped and ornamental grass areas and the associated irrigation/pump system;
replacement of park fixtures, including benches and tables, with recycled plastic equipment; replacement of portions of drainage systems; replacement of portions of concrete pathways; and
additional work required to connect interlinking areas. Some features will have been renovated prior to commencement of this project, within the scope of other capital projects, based on the
completion of their expected lifecycle and according to an established replacement schedule. As a result, they will not need to be included in the scope of this project.
Funds in FY 2026/27 are for design and funds in FY 2027/28 are for construction.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to secure for this facility the optimal level of recreational use, attractiveness, and sustainability in the future.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide a major renovation of the facility, originally built in 1955, to ensure its sustainability for the future by enhancing recreational usability, increasing attractiveness, and
reducing the use of utilities. Public input meetings will be held during the design phase to gather feedback from neighbors, park users, and other stake holders. The input will be utilized to assist in
determining the scope of work. The current scope includes replacement of landscaped and ornamental grass areas and the associated irrigation system; replacement of park fixtures, including
benches and tables, with recycled plastic equipment; replacement of drainage systems; replacement of concrete pathways; and the additional work required to connect interlinking areas. Some
features will have been renovated prior to commencement of this project, within the scope of other capital projects, based on the completion of their expected lifecycle and according to an
established replacement schedule. As a result, they will not need to be included in the scope of this project.
Funds in FY 2029/30 are for design and funds in FY 2030/31 are for construction.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to secure for this facility the optimal level of recreational use, attractiveness, and sustainability in the future.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide a major renovation of the facility, originally built in 1969, to ensure its sustainability for the future by enhancing recreational usability, increasing attractiveness and
reducing the use of utilities. Public input meetings will be held during the design phase to gather feedback from neighbors, park users and other stake holders. The input will be utilized to assist in
the determination of the scope of work. Current scope includes replacement of restroom building, replacement of athletic field and bleacher/fencing, replacement of park lighting systems with
energy efficient fixtures, construction of a playground, replacement of portions of landscaped and ornamental grass areas and associated irrigation/pump system, replacement of park fixtures
including benches and tables with recycled plastic equipment, replacement of portions of drainage systems, replacement of portions of concrete pathways and additional work required to connect
interlinking areas. Some features will have been renovated prior to commencement of this project, within the scope of other capital projects, based on the completion of their expected lifecycle and
according to an established replacement schedule. As a result, they will not need to be included in the scope of this project.
Funds in FY 2024/25 are for design and funds in FY 2025/26 are for construction.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to secure for this facility the optimal level of recreational use, attractiveness, and sustainability in the future.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This facility is located on the Community Center Campus and is comprised of the heritage orchard and adjacent structures including the museum, the Orchard Heritage building, and the park
maintenance/storage building. In 2011, Council approved revisions to the Orchard Heritage Park Master Plan that involved removing the cinder block wall separating the museum from the nearby
parking lot, relocating the maintenance building and adjacent dumpster enclosure elsewhere on the campus, and landscaping the area between the museum and the parking lot. This project will
provide for the demolition of the various structures, construction of new ones, and landscaping per the direction of the Master Plan. The purpose of this project is to make the museum and
surrounding area more accessible, usable, and attractive.
Funds in FY 2015/16 are for design and funds in FY 2016/17 are for construction.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Council has approved the site Master Plan for the changes involved in this project. Failure to complete this project will result in current site conditions remaining as they are and approved changes
to the Master Plan not being fulfilled. Practical ramifications include the museum and surrounding grounds being less accessible, usable, and attractive.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Plaza del Sol is being constructed using a phased approach as approved by Council in FY 2002/03. Phase I, which included construction of the basic plaza design, concrete paving, young trees,
other screening and selective decorative features, was completed in June 2004. Phase II includes enhancements to the basic plaza. The scope and intent of Plaza del Sol is being reevaluated due to
major changes occurring in downtown. Possible improvements for Phase II include additional landscaping, walkways, water features, restrooms, roofing for one of the two garage ramps, a memorial
dedicated to Sunnyvale residents and employees who have given their lives in service of the City and country (previously authorized), tents/awnings/umbrellas over specified areas, game facilities,
information/food/educational kiosks, and artwork.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The completion of Phase II for Plaza del Sol is intended to enhance use of the plaza through the additional features. The features have yet to be determined; however, based upon earlier studies and
discussions they may include ornamental water features, restrooms, and/or enhanced landscapes.
Upon completion of the project, there will be annual operating costs currently estimated at $15,000. These estimates may differ once design of the proposed Phase II improvements are finalized and
scheduled.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Park Dedication Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Columbia Neighborhood Center (CNC) is a sub-grantee and is receiving grant funds in the amount of $11,510 from the California School Health Centers Association (CSHC) to provide information
and education to the community about Covered California. Funds in FY 2013/14 will be used to participate in events that educate the community about Covered California and assist with
enrollment information. CNC has prepared a plan in which CNC staff will have a table with information and/or will make presentations to high school seniors and adults, with the planned objective
of conducting outreach activities to reach 600 individuals and educational activities to reach 1,400 individuals.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
CNC needs to document and report out to Covered California through SCHC all outreach and education activities, and must document serving 600 individuals through outreach and 1,400
individuals through educational activities.

Fiscal Impact
CNC already has staff who routinely perform outreach and education activities and will add Covered California into its existing topics to talk with the community. The grant funding from CSHC
will offset CNC's full-time staff costs and will enable CNC to extend its reach by paying for a Recreation Attendant to staff information tables.

Library
The ultimate goal of the Sunnyvale Public Library is to
provide a full service library which will meet the needs
of the community. In addition, the Library will strive to
provide a balanced collection that represents all points
of view. Library services are provided free of charge to
library users.
Library projects are primarily funded by the General
Fund. In addition, the Library receives State Grant
funds to provide specific services to the community.

Library Projects
Lakewood Branch Library Facility. This project is to
construct a branch library facility at the Lakewood
School site. This will increase access to library services
for those living in north Sunnyvale by making it more
convenient for residents to visit. Construction involves
removal of the existing Lakewood Pool and building a
library facility in its place. The total project is budgeted
for $11.5 million, funded by proceeds from the sale of
Raynor Activity Center in FY 2014/15.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project supports the costs of special projects not supported by the General Fund through the use of State Library Foundation Grant funds. Projects include staff development and training
programs, acquisition of additional special print and non-print items, public relations, and facilities enhancements.
The State Library Foundation Grant was established in 1982 through the adoption of State Education Code 18010 of Chapter 1.5 Public Library Finance by the State Legislature. This chapter calls
for continuing support of the grant, based on the availability of State funds with an allocation formula set by the State.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project supplements existing library services.

Fiscal Impact
The State Library Foundation Grant can only be used to supplement, not supplant, local revenues for basic library services. Spending categories for this project have been approved by the City
Council through grant acceptance budget modifications.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is to construct a branch library facility in the Lakewood Village neighborhood. On November 19, 2013 (RTC 13-275), Council authorized the $14.05 million sale and purchase
agreement between the City of Sunnyvale and Stratford School, Inc. for the Raynor Activity Center. Upon close of escrow, they directed that $11.5 million of the proceeds from the sale be used to
provide for the capital project for design, construction, and startup costs of a new branch library located at Lakewood Park. Staff estimates that a branch library of approximately 12,000 square feet
would cost approximately $11.5 million. This would be large enough to incorporate a community room that could replace the existing recreation building at Lakewood Park and be used for both
library services and recreational programs. The project is scheduled to start a two year design process in FY 2015/16 with construction to begin in FY 2017/18.
This project will increase access to library services for those living in north Sunnyvale by making it more convenient for residents to visit.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Residents living in north Sunnyvale are the only residents who must travel more than two miles to access library services. In fact, many residents in north Sunnyvale live over four miles from any
library. As a result, the Lakewood area has the lowest percentage of residents with Sunnyvale library cards than any neighborhood in Sunnyvale. Furthermore, there is a significant concentration of
seniors and youth in this area - the age groups tending to make the most use of library services, but also the most restricted in terms of mobility. As such, some of the City's residents with the most
to gain from library services have the most difficult time accessing those services. This project will address this issue and improve the quality of life for residents.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by proceeds from the sale of the Raynor Activity Center but will cause a corresponding increase in operating costs that must be funded by the General Fund. The annual
operating costs for the branch library are estimated to be approximately $439,000. Of this amount, $197,000 will be reallocated funding from the existing operating budget and will not constitute
new funding. The remaining $242,000 will be the net new funding requirement, which will be funded by the General Fund.

interim updates until all elements except Housing are
on the same schedule. This project funds costs
associated with these updates, such as professional
services for technical studies and environmental
analysis, publishing costs, and community outreach.

The goal of citizen participation in Sunnyvale is to
achieve a community in which residents and
businesses are able to effectively shape both their
future and the future of their city. Community
participation is an essential method for local
government to identify and respond to citizens’
concerns and needs, and therefore enhance the
delivery of municipal services and policy-making
processes. The projects in this section are included
with that in mind.

Council Set Aside. This project sets aside $100,000
annually throughout the twenty-year planning period
to be used at Council’s discretion for unplanned
projects, services, or other initiatives that come up over
the course of the fiscal year. For FY 2014/15, funding
is set at $35,000, as Council has appropriated $65,000
as follows: an additional $25,000 for Dispute
Resolution Services (Project 830630), $30,000 for
Downtown Association (Project 829620), and $10,000
for National League of Cities Youth, Education, and
Family Council (Project 830960).

Major projects in this category include City
improvement initiatives, studies initiated through the
study issues process, and other special projects to
assist with the City’s policy-making processes. These
projects are primarily funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City’s aerial photo is primarily used by Public Works, Public Safety and Community Development. It is used by Public Works for project review and design, and traffic engineering; in Public
Safety for special operations, incident mapping and investigations; and by Community Development for development review and exhibit preparation.
Historically, the City of Sunnyvale has partnered with the County of Santa Clara for acquisition of aerial photos. For more control over the accuracy, quality and timeliness of the aerial image, the
City is now partnering with the Cities of Cupertino and Mountain View for the update of this important tool. The City of Mountain View will manage the overall project.
While the accuracy of an aerial photo degrades at approximately three years (due to new development, street, curb and gutter changes, etc.), the cities feel that, barring any major landscape changes,
the useful life of the photo can be stretched to five years.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Aerial photography enhances the efficiency of land use, transportation, and public safety planning and design. Service levels for these functions would decline if less efficient field review, case by
case photography, or private consulting services were substituted.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City has developed a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for use by all departments. This project will provide funds in FY 2019/20 to complete the surveying and compilation of
City utility location information required to augment what has already been entered into the GIS database. The GIS records are updated annually as improvements are added and changes are made.
Regulatory agencies require that utility system maps are up to date and accurate in order for staff to effectively respond to and mitigate system component failure or emergencies. Discrepancies in
mapping can have significant adverse impacts if the wrong action is taken due to incomplete or inaccurate information. Public health and safety can also be at risk as a result of delayed response due
to inaccurate map information.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The GIS database provides more complete records and allows for better maintenance and documentation of the utilities system. It allows easier access to information by employees and the public.
The GIS database provides a mapping technique that is more reliable and safer than paper. The project is a large investment in the efficient operation of our mapping activities. Better, more
complete records aid in maintenance, operation, repair, and extension of the system.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Water Supply and Distribution Fund and the Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Redevelopment Successor Agency of the City of Sunnyvale was established February 1, 2012. The primary activity of the Successor Agency is to assist in winding down the affairs of the
former Redevelopment Agency.
In 2004, the Redevelopment Agency approved a Disposition and Development Agreement for development of the Town Center project. The original developer defaulted on dates for starting
construction of the project and the Agency engaged in negotiations with a substitute developer to take over the project. The Redevelopment Agency entered into an Amended and Restated
Disposition and Development and Owner Participation Agreement (ADDOPA) with a new developer in 2007. However, the developer defaulted on the loan in 2009. The Successor Agency is now
working with the Receiver and the bank to help transfer the project to a new developer.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
All costs associated with monitoring and administering the rights and obligations under the ADDOPA will be funded in this project. These costs include staff time as well as outside legal counsel.
Outside counsel will act as counsel of record, in association with the City Attorney and his or her designee, to perform legal services in connection with the project management of the development
agreement.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the former tax increment funds as an approved enforceable obligation.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The State of California mandates the preparation and periodic update of a General Plan that includes, at a minimum, seven “elements” related to the physical development of the community. The
General Plan updates are required to ensure that the plan reflects current conditions and goals of the community. In FY 2010/11 the General Plan was consolidated and reorganized into a single,
comprehensive document. Several of the required General Plan elements have recently been updated, and others will be completed in the next two years (Land Use, Transportation, Noise, Air
Quality, Housing and Community Revitalization). A comprehensive update to the entire General Plan is anticipated in the next 7-10 years. This special project funds a portion of the costs associated
with the General Plan updates (generally professional services for technical studies and environmental analysis, community outreach expenses, publishing expenses, etc.). The Housing Element is
the only element with a specific eight year update cycle prescribed by the State. Special projects will be separately proposed for updates to former General Plan Sub-element topics.
Funds in FY 2013/14, FY 2021/22, and FY 2029/30 are for updates to the Housing element. Comprehensive updates to the entire General Plan are expected for FY 2019/20-2020/21 and FY
2029/30-2030/31.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The State requires an annual review of the General Plan (which is accomplished through the Community Condition Indicators and staff reviews) and annual reporting to the State; further, the State
suggests a comprehensive review (not necessarily requiring an update) every five years. This project will help fund comprehensive updates every ten years (except for Housing) and interim updates
of specific elements until all elements (except the Housing Element) are on the same schedule. Comprehensive updates are expected to extend over a two-year period.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund, the Housing Fund, the Water Supply and Distribution Fund, the Wastewater Fund, and the Solid Waste Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The original City-wide Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) project (Budget Supplement #17, FY 2008/09) was reduced significantly in scope and funding allocation (Budget
Supplement #7, FY 2010/11) to provide for the proactive implementation of the citywide Records Retention and Destruction Schedule. Costs for this one-time project were estimated at
approximately $100,000, including expenses associated with both the disposal of outdated City records and with transitioning archival and active records to more cost-effective storage. Significant
savings were realized during this phase of the project. Continuing efforts on this project will fund one-time expenses associated with transitioning some City records to electronic storage. A pilot
project is being conducted to convert permanent legislative records to an electronic format, including minutes, ordinances, and resolutions.
In support of the City’s transition to electronic records management, an automated agenda management system (AAMS) was selected and is in the process of being implemented. The AAMS
integrates electronic management of agenda-related materials with the City’s current video-casting and archiving of digital meeting video and audio records. Funds remaining in this project will be
used to pursue an upgraded encoding appliance and SDI card, integrated vote-system hardware and software, and digital recording equipment and publishing software for public meetings held in
locations other than in the Council Chambers.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Proactive implementation of the City's Records Retention and Destruction Schedule resulted in a significant reduction in the City's stored records. The earlier Electronic Records Management
System project was quite costly and it was unclear whether the benefits accruing from records that are more accessible would result in the actual savings needed to outweigh the system's one-time
and annual costs. Staff continues to pursue ERMS solutions on a smaller scale in a more phased approach that will demonstrate activity-specific benefits.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
In 2011, this project was created in order to prepare a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the long-term lease of the Raynor Activity Center. This project was used to fund the Phase I environmental
studies, the creation of a separate parcel map for the Raynor Activity Center, and consultant fees associated with the lease. On May 8, 2012, the City Council rejected all lease proposals received,
declared the property surplus, and directed staff to initiate the sale of the Raynor Activity Center (RTC 12-113). Since the property was declared surplus, this project has been used to fund activities
needed to prepare for the sale, including consultant work on the preliminary parcel map, a property appraisal, and a preliminary title report.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The environmental assessments, lease consulting services, and the preliminary title report have been completed. The majority of the work on the tentative parcel map has also been completed. On
November 20, 2012, the City Council approved Budget Modification No. 17 to transfer $47,715 to Project 829830 – Raynor Sale Consulting Services (RTC 12-272). The remaining funds in this
project will be used to complete the tentative parcel map and to fund any other inspections or reports need to complete the sale of the property.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project sets aside $100,000 annually throughout the General Fund twenty-year planning period for unplanned projects, services, or other initiatives that come up over the course of the fiscal
year. This set aside had been budgeted in the past but was eliminated in FY 2009/10 to address the General Fund's structural deficit.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
With the improvement of the fiscal environment in FY 2012/13, the Council Service Level Set Aside was re-established at $100,000/year in the General Fund's Long Term Financial Plan. This set
aside can be used at Council's discretion to provide funding for initiatives that were otherwise unbudgeted.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund. For FY 2014/15, funding is set at $35,000, as $65,000 of the $100,000 original allocation has been appropriated as follows:
- $25k for Dispute Resolution Services (Project 830630)
- $30k for Downtown Association (Project 829620)
- $10k for NLC's (National League of Cities) Youth, Education and Family Council (Project 830960)

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is the second of two phases. Phase 2 includes the development of all elements of a Station Area Plan as well as a Toolkit for Mixed Use Development and an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR). The Lawrence Station Area planning project is being undertaken to address the inherent challenges of the existing patterns of development in the Lawrence Station Area. The Station
Area Plan is desired to promote transit-supportive land uses, densities, and an access and circulation framework that will revitalize the area and encourage transit ridership. Lawrence Area Station
Plan - Phase 2 will build upon the framework presented in Phase 1 through more detailed analysis and thorough discussions with the community. The result will be a preferred land use alternative
from the Citizen Advisory Group (CAG-selected by a City Council Sub-Committee), a Draft and Final EIR, and a Mixed Use Toolkit for City Council consideration.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
0n November 1, 2011, Council accepted Phase 1 of the Lawrence Station area with a provision that every point raised in the Council Study Session, the public hearing and various other meetings be
specifically addressed in Phase 2. Phase 1 provided a framework for land use and circulation with three land use alternatives. On June 12, 2012 the City Council accepted grant funds of $450,000
from Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC)to allow for completion of the plan preparation of the Toolkit for Mixed Use and associated environmental documents. On June 19, 2012
(RTC 12-143) Council awarded a contract for consultant services.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by a $450,000 grant through the MTC Focus Grant Program.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is a study that comprehensively investigates and evaluates school traffic in Sunnyvale from both an operational and programmatic perspective. The study addresses Transportation
Demand Management (TDM), traffic controls, and traffic enforcement. The intent of the study is to consider concerns that school area loading and unloading is chaotic in many areas, and to
determine whether TDM, additional controls, and/or additional enforcement could improve efficiency and safety. For TDM the study looks at a wide variety of factors to determine appropriate
levels of resources for the City to invest to encourage effective TDM for schools within the City. The study also looks at interfaces between the operations of the school district and the City, and
identifies opportunities for the City to invoke regulations or encourage TDM of school commuters. For traffic controls and enforcement, the study identifies whether a set of actions exists beyond
current traffic controls and enforcement resources to improve school zone traffic flow and enhance pedestrian safety.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Should a TDM program be adopted, it could require capital improvements to direct traffic, improve alternative transportation routes to schools, and/or install new traffic controls at schools. The
study could also result in recommendations for additional traffic enforcement and other activities which would give rise to additional operating costs.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Construction activity in Sunnyvale has been increasing significantly since January 2011. Based on the large number of projects in the early phases of construction and in pre-building permit review,
construction activity is anticipated to remain at a high level for at least the next several fiscal years.
On August 14, 2012, the City Council approved Budget Modification No. 7 (RTC 12-192)to project additional construction permitting revenue of $933,760 and to appropriate it to two new projects,
a Fire Prevention Construction-Related Permitting project and a Building Permitting project in the amounts of $590,760 and $343,000, respectively. This project budget will primarily be used to
hire contract/casual staff to assist with the additional workload that cannot be managed with the current staffing levels.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City’s performance measures for timely plan checking and construction inspection have recently suffered due to the tremendous influx of construction activity. This budget appropriation will
primarily be used to obtain contract help to maintain the City’s long established performance measures and to assist with the workload that cannot be managed with the current Building and Fire
staffing levels. Construction activity is cyclical and is closely monitored so that the City can respond effectively to customer needs. The option of using contract assistance during the next several
years of high activity will allow the City to promptly adjust staffing based on the immediate need.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by development revenues.

construction activity is anticipated to remain at a high level for at least the next several fiscal years.
On August 14, 2012, the City Council approved Budget Modification No. 7 (RTC 12-192) to project additional construction permitting revenue of $933,760 and to appropriate it to two new

be used to hire contract/casual staff to assist with the additional workload that cannot be managed with the current staffing levels.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Having adequate resources during highly active years is important in order to maintain our international reputation for a streamlined development permit process and excellent customer service. The
One-Stop Permit Center, and the streamlined development process that it has created, has served as a key economic development advantage for the City by allowing customers to start their
development projects as quickly as possible. In addition to the One-Stop Permit Center, the prompt inspection scheduling is a great benefit and highly popular with our customers because it
eliminates construction delays that are very costly. Sunnyvale is well recognized for its responsive plan checking and construction inspection services. Most recently, Sunnyvale’s development
review process was highlighted by the San Jose Chamber of Commerce as a model for other cities.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by building permitting revenue.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The Peery Park Specific Plan will provide the City, property owners and businesses with a guide for future development within the Peery Park area. The Specific Plan is desired to provide general
vision and broad policy concepts to guide development, but also provide the details on the type, location and intensity of uses, define the capacity and design of needed public improvements and
infrastructure, and determine the resources necessary to finance and implement the public improvements and infrastructure needed to support the vision for the area. The project will contain an
analysis of issues, constraints and opportunities; a Specific Plan including the following elements: Goals and Policies, Land Use, Infrastructure, Transportation/Circulation, Urban Design, Design
Guidelines, and Implementation, Financing and Phasing; and a Draft and Final EIR for City Council consideration.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
On October 16, 2012 the City Council approved Budget Modification No. 13 (RTC 12-230) to allocate $300,000 from the General Fund Budget Stabilization Fund to prepare the Peery Park
Specific Plan and Environmental Impact Report. The City Council also approved the concept of a fee on new development in the Specific Plan area; the fee would reimburse the city for the costs of
plan preparation. This fee cannot be implement until a plan is adopted. At the same meeting the Council also appropriated a $250,000 contribution from The Irvine Company to offset the City's
upfront cost to prepare the specific plan.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund and through a contribution from the Irvine Company.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds minor property management costs associated with three parcels at the former Onizuka Air Force Station. The next steps for implementing the Amended Onizuka Redevelopment
Plan that was approved by the City Council on December 13, 2011 include acceptance of three parcels at the former Onizuka Air Force Station through quitclaim deeds from the Air Force
consisting of (1) a public benefit conveyance for a 1.03 acre parcel at the north end of the property for expansion of the Fire Station No. 5 site (Parcel A) and (2)a homeless housing conveyance for
two parcels totaling 5.02 acres at the south end of the property (Parcels D and E). Once the City assumes ownership of the parcels, minor property management costs are expected to be incurred for
incidental administration, maintenance and security measures as needed, as well as other real estate and professional services related to the sale or lease of the property.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City is expected to receive title to its Onizuka parcels by June 13 and will be responsible for incidental caretaker costs expected for items related to maintenance, minor repairs, and security.
Funding for this project is provided by the General Fund's Budget Stabilization Fund. These costs will be reimbursed to the General Fund following the sale or lease of the property.

Fiscal Impact
This Project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City's financial system, which is the one repository for all City financial data and transactions, is over 16 years old, obsolete, and in need of replacement. Budgeted funds are available in the
Information Technology Department equipment replacement account for the replacement of the hardware and software components of a new financial system; however, no funds have been set aside
to cover the essential planning and project support functions that are required for a successful implementation. This project provides funding for a two-year period for the City to contract with a
consultant to provide project management services.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The scope and magnitude of a project to replace a central financial system is significant, and as a result, project management is required to help ensure a successful implementation. The central role
of the project manager during the planning process will be to review the workflow and processes for all relevant functional areas, including general ledger accounting, budget, accounts payable,
accounts receivable, purchasing, and inventory management; assist with the development of the request for proposals; and provide project management during the implementation phase of the
project. Current City staff does not have the capacity nor the expertise to serve in this role, and staff believes funding for these types of support services is essential to a successful, on time
implementation as well as in containing overall project costs.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by a contribution from all City Funds.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will provide the Engineering Division a capital improvement management system that will integrate project phases, schedules, budgets, funding, payments, and stakeholders. The
system will be an essential tool to deliver the capital program in a timely and efficient manner.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Engineering Division manages between 40 and 80 capital projects during any fiscal year at an approximate annual budget ranging from $25 million to $60 million. Projects' scope also varies
and requires extensive monitoring, scheduling, budgeting, and reporting. Usual office software including Microsoft Excel, Access and Projects are inadequate to handle the City’s capital program
efficiently. In addition, the City’s financial system is not equipped to provide the Engineering Division tailored reports for project status and funding. As a result, staff commits increased resources
to manage the program and to develop necessary reports.
FY 2013/14 funds provide for managing approximately half the projects and for initial setup and training. Funds for FY 2014/15, FY 2015/16, and FY 2016/17 allow for integration of additional
projects. Following fiscal years' funds provide for annual subscription to the system.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the various funds that fund the City's Capital Improvement Program.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The current Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system has been developed in-house and has several fundamental design flaws that put it at risk of failure. In order to be assured of ongoing
service, the system must be completely redesigned or replaced with a commercial application. Funds budgeted in FY 2013/14 were based on estimates of commercial offerings that had been
preliminarily evaluated, and a more comprehensive study will be completed to determine the optimal solution from a cost and functionality perspective.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The CRM provides an important communication conduit for the residents of the city. It allows a one-location place to register comments on public policy, request services, or otherwise
communicate with staff and Council.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Services Fund/Technology and Communication Services Subfund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
In the month following Council action to request a facilitated retreat, staff began researching potential facilitators, dates and locations. Based on research and the recommendations of industry
experts, the City Manager has selected The Art of Change to provide services with Dr. Rick Kirschner acting as facilitator. At Council request, the timeline for the retreat has been postponed until
after the November 2013 election. Currently, staff is working to secure the Heritage Museum as the venue.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
At its January 29, 2013 meeting, Council requested a retreat with a facilitator to work out ongoing issues amongst Council. This project will fund that retreat. The potential costs include fee and
travel expenses for the facilitator, and meals at the retreat.

Fiscal Impact
The estimated project cost is $21,000; the project will be funded out of the Council set-aside fund. The facilitator fee is $10,000 for the first day and $7,500 for the second; travel expenses, including
airfare, lodging, parking, ground transportation, food and drink, are estimated at $2,000. Additionally, $500 is budgeted for food and beverages for the retreat and $1,000 is budgeted to secure a
venue.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for a study to examine the potential benefits of constructing a large solar array and selling shares in the project to the community. This issue was initiated by the Sustainability
Commission and was originally included in DPW 10-09 "Reliable Electrical Power Options". Significant progress has been made by PG&E to address power reliability issues in the Moffett Park
area, and therefore, the feasibility of a community solar array system was studied as a stand alone issue in FY 2013/14.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Construction and operation of a solar array would require a large capital outlay and ongoing operating costs. The costs could potentially be covered by the sale of shares to community members.
This study will prepare a cost recovery analysis to determine the economic viability.

Fiscal Impact
In FY 2013/14 Council approved Budget Supplement No. 4, which provides $15,000 to study this issue. This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for a study to evaluate the City's participation in a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to aquire alternative energy on City owned or controlled facilities. A PPA is an agreement
with an alternative energy provider that installs alternative energy systems at no cost to the City. The City then consumes the power generated by the system at a predetermined rate and any excess
would belong to the PPA provider to sell on the open market. In order to evaluate the viability of a PPA, the City must perform site surveys.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This study was proposed by the Sustainability Commission (Study Issue ESD 13-01). The budget for this project is based on the assumption that 20 sites will be surveyed at a cost of $2,500 per site.
On average, a PPA can yield a 15-30% energy cost savings per year. The typical term of a PPA is 20 years with options to purchase the system outright after 7 years.

Fiscal Impact
Council approved Budget Supplement No. 4 in FY 2013/14 which provides $50,000 for this study. This project is funded equally by each of the City's three utility funds.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The National League of Cities' Youth, Education and Family (YEF) Council hosts three annual out-of-state meetings (two held concurrent with conferences). This project funding would enable a
youth and his/her chaperone to attend these meetings for one year, in the event that the youth is appointed to the YEF Council.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The YEF Council has 3 - 5 of its membership nationwide open to youth, available on a competitive application process for one-year appointments. No potential candidates from Sunnvyale have
been solicited, and it is unknown whether a youth candidate from Sunnyvale would be successful and would be appointed and require these resources. However, were a youth to be successful, it
would provide the City with excellent exposure, while also providing tremendous personal growth experiences to the youth, who would then share those experiences with other local teens.

Fiscal Impact
Funding for this project is provided as a one-time expense from the FY 2014/15 Council Set-Aside balance (Project 829630) in the General Fund.

Trudi Ryan

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is an update of the Precise Plan for El Camino Real (Plan), which was originally adopted in 1993 and last updated in 2007. Although the 2007 Plan articulates an enhanced vision for El
Camino Real as a vibrant, mixed-use corridor with pedestrian-oriented environments, it does not enough provide specificy to effectively guide development. At a minimum, this project will include
a market demand analysis to assess the future viability of commercial and residential uses along the corridor and the appropriate environmental review. These analyses will be used to determine the
appropriate mix of uses and specify development standards in the Plan area. If additional funding is secured through grant applications, this project will include a more extensive community
involvement process, more thorough market demand and land use analyses, multimodal access and pedestrian-friendly design/placemaking guidelines and implementation strategy. The grant would
allow the preparation of a programmatic EIR and a more comprehensively updated Plan. General Plan and zoning amendments may be necessary to ensure consistency with the updated Plan.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The City Council combined and highly ranked two study issues in January 2014 to update and clarify policies and development standards in the Precise Plan for El Camino Real (CDD 14-09 and
CDD 14-14). Staff applied for the MTC/ABAG Priority Development Area Planning Grant to fund the Plan update and the project was selected as a recipient. If the grant is accepted by Council, it
would allow for a much broader study, extensive community outreach, and comprehensive update of the Plan than originally anticipated in the two study issues. The funding agreement with MTC is
required to be signed by the end of November to secure the grant. Staff estimates the project will take approximately 18 months to complete.

Fiscal Impact
Council has approved $80,000 to complete the market demand analysis and environmental review for the update of the Precise Plan for El Camino Real for consultant services as part of Budget
Supplement #2 in the FY 2014/15 Adopted Budget. Project management will be provided by Planning staff under the Planning Program 234. The project has been selected to receive $587,000
through the MTC/ABAG Priority Development Area Planning Grant. If the grant is accepted by Council, the $80,000 could be used for contingencies to complete the Plan update.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project investigates the creation of a Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program for the City. Funds budgeted for this project are for the procurement of consultant services. A consultant
is necessary to conduct the first phase of a feasibility study and perform outreach to the community. As part of the City's adopted Climate Action Plan, a CCA would enable the City to increase the
renewable energy portfolio of electricity delivered to Sunnyvale so that more than 50% of delivered energy comes from renewable sources by 2035 to meet or exceed the CAP target.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is integral to the City’s CAP. A CCA is specifically identified in the CAP as measure EP-1 (1.1). A CCA constitutes the single most impactful measure for greenhouse reductions in the
CAP. Greenhouse gas reductions associated with the CCA measure provide greater greenhouse gas reductions than every other measure in the CAP combined; thus it will be instrumental in meeting
the goals of AB 32, which drives the CAP. The outcome expected from a CCA is local control over the procurement and provision of renewable energy to Sunnyvale residents and businesses. One
or more neighboring communities are committing funding to participate and co-fund this phase of study. The project will result in a study identifying other cities interested in participating in a
CCA, costs and risks to Sunnyvale and participating cities or cities associated with the establishment of a CCA, the framework that would guide CCA establishment, and implementation of some
CAP measures through a CCA.

Fiscal Impact
The fiscal impact of this project is dependent on the results of the feasibility study. The study will identify the costs associated with completing a technical analysis and with formation of a CCA.
This is a preliminary step to conducting a full fledged technical feasibility study which would cost $300-500K and which would be needed to determine the feasibility of forming a South Bay CCA.
Council has approved $30,000 for a preliminary evaluation of establishing a CCA as part of Budget Supplement #8 in FY 2014/15.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is to enter into a collaborative partnership to expand the Our City Forest program to Sunnyvale businesses and residents to provide educational opportunities, expand Sunnyvale’s urban
canopy and supplement the City’s efforts through the use of volunteers. The cost of the program would be a result of financial support for Our City Forest to implement and support their program in
Sunnyvale.

t
c
e
j
o

The City of Sunnyvale maintains over 37,000 street trees. It's estimated that there is one private property tree for every street tree in Sunnyvale. The CAP assumes the City will plant 5% and 10%
more trees by 2020 and 2035, respectively. This is 1,850 trees by 2020 and 3,700 trees by 2035. The City’s current goal is to plant 150-350 replacement trees per year and 50 new trees per year on
public property. A partnership with Our City Forest would help supplement the City’s efforts and serve residents that want to plant a tree on private property. A partnership would help expand the
City canopy beyond what is currently budgeted with City Staff.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

Our City Forest's program provides residents and businesses a hands on educational opportunity and personal responsibility for the care of a tree and its selection. Benefits include greenhouse gas
reductions from more trees and budget control through maintenance and care of the existing canopy that has experienced reduced trimming schedules.
There is likely to be a positive fiscal impact as a result of a partnership with Our City Forest. The City may realize cost reductions by leveraging Our City Forests tree planting program.
Additionally, service levels could conceivably be increased since City staff could focus on maintenance and management of the existing canopy within current operational constraints.

Fiscal Impact
This project is currently unfunded.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project would be to develop a mechanism for tracking implementation of Climate Action Plan actions and quantifying greenhouse gas emission reductions on an ongoing basis. A CAP
tracking system will allow the City to provide quantitative data in support of the CAP implementation for CEQA streamlining and AB 32 targets. The tracking system will provide the City
information that can be used for formal goal setting by City leaders and tracking to ensure those goals are being met. The City will use the CAP implementation matrix and develop a corresponding
implementation tool to track, monitor, and update the CAP’s implementation progress or explore participating in a regional tracking platform being considered at the County level. Costs incurred
during this project will be the result of developing the tracking tool or the cost involved with participating in a regional tool.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

To ensure the success of this Climate Action Plan, the City must integrate the goals and strategies of the CAP into other local and regional plans, programs, and activities. As the City moves forward
with the Land Use and Transportation Element update as well as Zoning Code updates, Specific Plans, Housing Element updates, and other planning documents, staff must ensure these documents
support and are consistent with the CAP. Crucial to the implementation of the CAP will be the City’s implementation matrix. This matrix contains the GHG reduction, cost, savings, and co-benefit
information presented in Chapter 3 of the CAP for the year 2020, as well as more detail for City staff to effectively integrate these actions into their work plans.

This project will be cost neutral, although the City may realize savings through efficiencies in the planning process. Additionally, in order for the City to have a functional CAP a mechanism to
track GHG emissions is necessary.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project is to conduct site surveys at appropriate City owned/controlled properties to evaluate and determine alternative energy potential. In order for the City to take advantage of alternative
energy financing, partnership or group buy opportunities, site surveys are required to be conducted. The surveys, conducted by consultant, identify critical information necessary to determine the
appropriate alternative energy technology (e.g. solar, wind, fuel cell), site characteristics for sizing systems, and cost analyses based on site characteristics. The cost of this project is related to the
cost of the site surveys. It is estimated that a single site survey costs about $2500. With a $50,000 proposed budget the City would complete 25 site surveys, which would be ideal for evaluating
financing opportunities like Power Purchase Agreements and group buys.

t
c
e
j
o

This project is in alignment with the CAP. Renewable energy directly contributes to reduction of GHG's. CAP Reduction Measure EP-2 calls to “increase the number of on-site renewable energy
installations in the community.” The outcome of this project is identification of information needed for decisions regarding implementation of alternative energy at City facilities. Financing
programs are available to the City that include low cost, no cost and self-financing mechanisms, but require detailed site characteristics to evaluate the costs associated with the different
mechanisms. All no cost options, like a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), require a site survey before the City can participate. PPA opportunities are very popular and will decrease over time as
aggregation opportunities diminish as result of their popularity. The City can use site surveys to compare the costs/benefits of a PPA with the City implementing alternative energy on its own.

d
e
d

f

Project Evaluation and Analysis

Power purchase agreements provide an energy cost savings between 15-30% with no capital or operating expenses. The City could have that expectation at the very least by participating in a PPA.
Additionally, site surveys would allow the city to compare the economics of participating in a PPA with the City implementing alternative energy independently. Although there would be capital
and operating costs involved, the long term cost savings may be beneficial to the City.

Administrative Facilities
This section includes all projects that deal directly with
the City’s administrative facilities, including the Civic
Center, the Sunnyvale Office Center, and the
Corporation Yard. Also included are City-owned
properties that were purchased for potential
redevelopment purposes.

most critical rehabilitation needs have been funded for
FY 2014/15.

Major Projects

Resurfacing of City Owned Parking Lots.
This
project funds routine resurfacing of City-owned
parking lots. Lots addressed in the twenty-year plan
horizon include those at 14 parks throughout the City,
both golf courses, the Corporation Yard, Water
Pollution Control Plant, City Hall, the SMaRT Station,
all six Fire Stations, the Community Center, Public
Safety Lots G & H, and the Sunnyvale Office Center.
Parking lots are resurveyed every two years to update
their condition, estimated resurfacing costs, and
maintenance schedule.

Administrative Facilities projects are primarily funded
by the General Fund. Rental income from City-owned
property also provides revenue for the maintenance
and rehabilitation work for those specific properties;
however, these revenues will cease when the properties
are developed or sold.
As part of the Long-Range Infrastructure Plan (LRIP), a
review was recently completed that provided a strategic
context for the repair or replacement of the various
administrative facilities that will be needed by
Sunnyvale based on the long-term facilities needs for
City staff. Upon completion of this review, a number of
alternatives were presented for rehabilitation and/or
replacement of various City facilities, including the
Civic Center facility. These alternatives are still being
considered and funding sources have not yet been
identified. Until the strategic plan has been finalized,
including identifying funding mechanisms for the
major rehabilitation/replacement projects, only the

Corporation Yard Buildings Rehabilitation.
The Corporation Yard buildings have been evaluated as
part of the LRIP and determined to require renovation
or upgrades for a multitude of reasons, including aging
infrastructure and newer code requirements. Due to
the number of buildings and the diversity of services
occurring at the Corporation Yard, this site is budgeted
for ongoing critical improvement/repair to maintain a
safe and functional environment.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
As part of the Long Range Infrastructure Plan (LRIP), the Corporation Yard buildings require renovation or upgrades for a multitude of reasons, including when safety improvements or equipment
replacements trigger an upgrade to meet newer code requirements, or repairs and replacements are required due to aging infrastructure. Deficiencies in these buildings are identified by Facility
Services and cost estimates are based on past experience, industry knowledge, and/or professional estimates.
Funds in FY 2012/13 were utilized to provide for additional security improvements for card key access; installation of OSHA-approved ladders for access to warehouse roofs; repairs to storage
buildings; replacement of chain link fences; minor remodeling of work spaces to accommodate alignment of departments working in the Corporation Yard; a comprehensive five-year test of the fire
sprinkler system and corrections of deficiencies discovered during the test.
Funds budgeted in FY 2013/14 and beyond serve as placeholders for ongoing infrastructure rehabilitation. Due to the uncertainty in timing of the future replacement of these buildings, funds will
only be spent on critical rehabilitation.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
Corporation Yard facilities are regularly evaluated. Due to the type and diversity of services occurring at this facility, combined with the number of buildings, this site has an ongoing need for a
multitude of critical improvement/repair projects to maintain a safe and functional environment. No additional operating costs are associated with this project.

Fiscal Impact
Funding is from multiple sources including the General Fund, the Water Supply and Distribution Fund, the Wastewater Management Fund, and the General Services Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the replacement of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for the Corporation Yard complex. The systems requiring replacement are identified by
inspections, manufacturers’ specifications on equipment life spans, and failures that may occur. Cost estimates are based on a variety of methods including past experience, knowledge of the
industry, and estimates from professionals.
Funds in FY 2014/15 are for the replacement of package HVAC units at the Corporation Yard fleet area and support shop areas. This will allow for continued operation and minimized energy
waste. Life cycles for these HVAC components are 20 years.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
An engineering evaluation of these systems determined they could be maintained for the short term but would need replacement in FY 2014/15. Cost estimates are based on this recommendation.
Prolonging these projects may result in higher operational costs due to a higher frequency of repairs and/or higher capital costs for emergency HVAC component replacement.

Fiscal Impact
Funding will be from the General Fund, Water Supply and Distribution Fund, Wastewater Management Fund, and General Services Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project funds resurfacing (including preparation, patching, slurry seal, curb painting and striping) of City-owned parking lots. Lots are resurveyed every two years to update condition,
scheduling and estimated cost. Estimates are based on past costs, current conditions, and projected material costs. Changes in material prices, related projects, and delays can result in cost and
timing changes.
Scheduled resurfacing includes the Corporation Yard (FY 2013/14); Water Pollution Control Plant (FY 2014/15); City Hall and De Anza Park (FY 2015/16); Baylands Park (FY 2016/17); Serra,
Lakewood, Las Palmas, and Washington Parks; the SMaRT Station, including the employee parking lot (FY 2017/18); Fire Stations 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and Ponderosa and Braly Parks (FY 2018/19);
Murphy, Panama, and Raynor Parks (FY 2019/20); Fire Station 2, Ortega Park, and both golf courses (FY 2020/21); Community Center and Public Safety Lots G & H (FY 2021/22) and Sunnyvale
Office Center (FY 2022/23). New park parking lots at Seven Seas Park and Fair Oaks Park are scheduled for a slurry seal in FY 2024/25. Funding in other years serves as a placeholder for
resurfacing that has yet to be determined.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The alternative to this project is to allow the parking lots to deteriorate and reconstruct the most affected areas. Reconstruction costs approximately six times more than resurfacing.

Fiscal Impact
Project is funded by the General Fund, Water Supply and Distribution Fund, Wastewater Management Fund, Solid Waste Management Fund, Park Dedication Fund, and Sunnyvale Office Center.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides funding for general maintenance as well as roofing, flooring, plumbing, and electrical system repairs for the six city-owned properties adjacent to parks. The City owns three
single family residences adjacent to Murphy Park and three adjacent to Orchard Gardens Park. These properties were acquired to facilitate future park expansion, and the houses need to be
maintained until sold or demolished. The City receives rental revenue from these properties.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The three houses adjacent to Murphy Park were scheduled for sale at the end of FY 2012/13. This budget has been adjusted to assume the Murphy Park properties will be sold and will not need
maintenance in FY 2014/15. The three homes near Orchard Gardens Park will likely be vacated at the end of 2014 and demolished for park expansion. Once vacated, this project budget will provide
minimal maintenance for these properties until they are demolished.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by rental revenue.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides maintenance and repairs for City-owned rental and vacant properties in the Downtown area. The properties include two single family residences (344 and 406 Charles Street),
a duplex (377 and 379 Mathilda Avenue), two vacant lots (365 and 403 Mathilda Avenue), a condo (715 San Conrado Terrace, added in August 2010), and the former Chamber of Commerce
Building (101 West Olive Avenue).
Specifically, the project provides funding for roofing, flooring, plumbing, and electrical system repairs, as well as for general maintenance. Per Council direction, properties that are located on
Charles Street and Mathilda Avenues will be maintained until after the Mall is redeveloped, at which time Council will revisit the disposition of all existing parcels. It is not known when these
properties will be sold; however, this budget assumes this will occur in FY 2016/17.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain City-owned income-producing property. Staff estimates that once the downtown properties on Mathilda Avenue and Charles Street are sold, the maintenance of
the remaining properties will cost approximately $2,400 per year for property taxes and repair costs. Funding for property maintenance and repairs was increased in FY 2013/14 to reflect actual
costs of necessary maintenance.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by rental income on the properties.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The project is to replace underground fuel storage tanks. The City has five vehicle fueling facilities, all utilizing underground tanks. A conditional assessment found all the tanks to be operationally
sound. Therefore, replacement of the tanks, which was originally scheduled from FY 2008/09 through FY 2011/12, was deferred until FY 2014/15. Replacement is now scheduled to begin in FY
2014/15 for the City Hall fuel docks and in FY 2016/17 for Sunnyvale Golf Course and the Corporation Yard. The replacements will be designed in one year and completed the following year.
The replacements are required to meet more current air and water district regulations. Initially, this project included stop-gap repair cost estimates, to include any work needed to extend the life of
the tanks until replacement. However, the condition of the tanks has been certified as good enough for them to last until they are replaced, resulting in some overall project cost savings. It is
anticipated that the new tanks will be above-ground when feasible, which will result in lower installation costs and easier access and monitoring of the tanks' conditions.
Replacements of the tanks at the City Hall Annex and Public Safety are budgeted in separate projects and will be coordinated with the scheduled replacement of their corresponding emergency
generators.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
All tanks are operationally sound and their life expectancy has been extended with the agreement and understanding of the City’s Hazardous Materials Coordinator, our fuel systems maintenance
provider, and our third-party tank inspector.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the Golf and Tennis Fund, General Fund, General Services Fund, Water Supply and Distribution Fund, and Wastewater Management Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for minor upgrades and emergency repairs of the Sunnyvale Office Center. The Sunnyvale Office Center is a seven-building complex housing a combination of private office
space and City operations. This project provides funds for Facility Services to keep the aging complex functional in a safe manner by responding to deficiencies, including structural, roof,
electrical, plumbing, and other items.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The Sunnyvale Office Center was constructed in 1962 and its overall condition is poor. This project is to address emergency repairs and corrections including replacement of heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, as failures with the underfloor air duct system have presented a challenge to keeping the building temperature constant. The roofing systems are displaying
significant dry-rot and sagging wood members are noticeable at several locations of the roof. The wood walkways and canopies are also displaying sagging wood members and dry-rot is present at
these locations too.
No additional operating costs are associated with this project. Additional years of funding may be required if the life of the Sunnyvale Office Center is extended.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by revenue generated by the Sunnyvale Office Center Complex.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
The City purchased the 239-241 Commercial Street property, formerly known as the Shimada Building, in January 2003 for the expansion of the City corporation yard. The property is a 1950s
concrete tilt-up building and is currently leased to a towing company and tire shop. The property will continue to be leased until the corporation yard expansion construction begins, the date of
which has not been determined.
The lease revenues generate enough funds to cover the costs of maintenance for the site until the corporation yard expansion. Funding is needed for maintenance and repairs of the property,
including roofing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, and electrical systems. This project will be coordinated with the Corporation Yard Master Plan and Facility
Replacement projects.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain City-owned income-producing property.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by revenues the City receives from leases with the towing company and the tire shop.

Per Council direction, properties that are located on Charles Street and Mathilda Avenue will be maintained until after the Mall is redeveloped, at which time Council will revisit the disposition of
all existing parcels. It is not known when these properties will be sold; however, this budget assumes this will occur in FY 2016/17.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
This project is necessary to maintain City-owned income-producing property.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded through rental income on the property.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project will replace roll up doors at six fire stations, based on condition at inspection. The replacement will also include the replacement of control components for the six fire station ring down
lighting systems and main breakers for the electrical mains.
The ring down lighting system is an automatic control system that turns on all lighting in the fire station when an emergency call comes in during the evening. This allows the firefighters to respond
quickly when a call comes in while staff is sleeping. The current system is an antiquated group of control contactors that are difficult to locate when repairs are needed.
There have been two interruptions to the systems at two different locations. The main breaker installation is recommended to upgrade from the current blade cartridge fuse system. The breaker will
allow the system to be reset rather than having to replace cartridge fuses. The doors are scheduled to be inspected and replaced in FY 2013/14. The electrical design work is scheduled for FY
2014/15, and construction is scheduled for FY 2015/16.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The door replacement is necessary because this equipment has reached the end of its useful life. The electrical upgrades are recommended as safety improvements to the fire stations. The ring down
lighting system allows the firefighters to respond immediately without having to turn on lights to maneuver to their truck. The service disconnect will allow easy reset in the event of a power outage.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
Fremont Union High School District (FUHSD) and the City entered into an agreement for maintenance of the pool house in 2002. Staff has identified significant structural deficiencies that have
caused serious damage and will require major repairs. This project provides for major infrastructure improvements to the Fremont High School pool house building that are more extensive than
normal routine maintenance. The repairs will address deficient shower drains, inadequate air flow inside the two locker rooms, and damages to building infrastructure as a result of the deficiencies.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The pool house repairs are necessary to resolve ongoing concerns for user safety and to protect the infrastructure of the building. The pool house is heavily used by patrons of a program operator
working under contract with the City to provide aquatic programs. Repairs to the pool house building were necessary in FY 2013/14. Infrastructure upgrades will be necessary every 15 years.
Funding listed in FY 2028/29 is for shower fixture replacements, grout resealing, and other infrastructure upgrades.
Project costs are preliminary and will be updated based on a facility assessment report now being prepared by FUHSD.

Fiscal Impact
The City's portion of the project cost is funded by the Park Dedication Fund. The city and FUHSD are currently negotiating the cost share on this project.

Richard Chen

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for inspection and documentation of the structural integrity of the City’s Live Fire Training Tower located at Fire Station 2. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
regulation 1403 recommends a 10-year structural inspection of the facility to determine if damage to the concrete building has occurred due to live fire training. The inspection will require removal
of steel wall coverings and concrete core sampling of the three levels of live fire rooms to measure the structural integrity of the facility. As part of this inspection, it is anticipated that some
replacement of steel wall covering will be necessary, as well as some concrete repair due to coring activity.

Project Evaluation and Analysis
The five-story concrete Fire Training Tower is a facility for county-wide firefighter training. The Sunnyvale tower is over 10 years old and is due for a structural safety inspection. An engineering
firm will perform the inspection pursuant to NFPA regulation 1403. Delaying this project could prolong detection of deterioration of the concrete structure and result in larger repair costs and
potential safety violations.
Project costs are based on recent rates for engineering services and construction costs. Future work identified in the structural inspection will be budgeted in a separate project.

Fiscal Impact
This project is funded by the General Fund.

was verified by staff.

t
c
e
j
o

In recent years, the roofs of the Corporation Yard administrative building, auto shop, meter shop, and warehouse have been replaced with Title 24-compliant cool roofs. Funds in FY 2023/24 are for
the roofs of the Corporation Yard warehouse, auto shop, and the meter shop. Depending on the outcome of the replacement, future year funds in this project will be adjusted. Cost estimates were
based on the most recent replacement.

Project Evaluation and Analysis

r
P
d
e
d
n
u
f

Delay of this project beyond the replacement cycle may result in higher operational cost due to a higher frequency of repairs and/or higher capital cost for emergency roof replacement.

Fiscal Impact

This project is currently unfunded pending the results of the Corporation Yard Master Plan. Funding for this project will likely be from the General Fund, Water Supply and Distribution Fund,

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This project provides for the planned replacement of the recently installed security access control system. This project was completed during FY 2010/11 and replaced the antiquated access and
security system for City Hall, City Hall Annex, South Annex, Library, Public Safety, Corporation Yard, Community Center, and Senior Center buildings. Funds in FY 2030/31 are for the
replacement of this system, which is expected to have a 20-year component life. Cost estimates were determined based on the recently completed project.

t

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
This proposed project provides for design and construction of the Corporation Yard buildings that are in need of replacement. The scope of the replacement will be determined by a building
replacement master plan project. The following buildings may be subject to replacement: administration, fleet maintenance, warehouse, sign shop, evidence room, temporary office, and storage. The
useful life of the new buildings would be 50 years.

Project Description / Scope / Purpose
On July 31, 2012, City Council conducted a joint study session with the Board of Library Trustees regarding "Future Library and Civic Center Facility Options". Council directed the City Manager
to further explore redevelopment of the existing Civic Center Campus via a public/private partnership model, with the main library relocated to the Community Center campus. Once this option has
been explored, it will be considered against other options available, including: moving City Hall to a new downtown location with a financing plan that could involve selling all or a portion of the
existing City Hall campus);floating a bond to build a new library then using the old library to help meet other campus needs; simply refurbishing existing campus buildings and accepting functional
and adjacency shortcomings; and redesigning and rehabilitating existing buildings with possibly some associated increase in footprints.
