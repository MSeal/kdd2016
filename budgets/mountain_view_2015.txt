Honorable City Council
City of Mountain View
FISCAL YEAR 2014-15 ADOPTED OPERATING BUDGET
Honorable Mayor Clark and Members of the City Council:
This transmittal summarizes the Adopted Operating Budget based on Council input
from the Narrative Budget Study Session held on April 29, 2014 and the public hearings
on June 10, 2014 and June 17, 2014. The budget was formally adopted after the Public
Hearing on June 17, 2014.
INTRODUCTION
The City’s financial health is shaped, to a large degree, by economic forces beyond the
City’s control and has been significantly impacted by what has become known as the
“Great Recession” that began in December 2007. Although this recession was officially
declared over as of December 2009, the recovery has been long and slow. For four
years, Fiscal Years 2009-10 through 2012-13, the General Operating Fund (GOF), the
single largest City fund which provides funding for core City services, experienced
structural deficits in which ongoing revenues were insufficient to meet ongoing
expenditures. These deficits were thoughtfully addressed, taking the necessary actions
to adopt structurally balanced budgets in order to provide a strong foundation for
economic recovery.
Fiscal Year 2013-14 was the first year where strong revenue growth was able to support
expenditure growth without budget reductions. As of June 2014, the unemployment
rate in the City is 4.0 percent, consumer confidence has begun to rise, and housing and
property values have regained prerecessionary levels in Mountain View. In addition,
the City’s sound fiscal practices and budget discipline have allowed the City to
maintain its AAA credit rating, a status few other California cities can claim.
Building on this strong financial record and continued revenue growth, this is the
second budget cycle since the “Great Recession” began that is balanced without any
reductions, and it includes a few new expenditures for high-priority programs. This

GENERAL OPERATING FUND
The General Operating Fund is the single largest City fund and supports the core
services provided by the City, including Police, Fire, Parks, Recreation, Library Services,
some Planning and Public Works, and Administration. This fund was significantly
impacted by the economic downturn and experienced structural budget deficits. As a
result of four years of strategic adjustments, the City has been able to minimize the
negative impacts on our residents and customers and preserve a wide range of highquality services.
The General Operating Fund Adopted Budget is summarized below (dollars in
thousands):

Details of the Adopted General Operating Fund revenues and expenditures are
included on Page 5-4 and in the General Operating Fund 10-Year Long-Range Financial
Forecast section of this document. A summary of the Fiscal Year 2014-15 General
Operating Fund Adopted Budget is discussed below.
General Operating Fund 10-Year Long-Range Financial Forecast
Included in this Adopted Budget document is the General Operating Fund 10-Year
Long-Range Financial Forecast (Forecast). The practice of forecasting is an important
part of a city’s financial planning process and while it can be challenging to precisely
forecast local government revenues due to the variable nature of the revenue sources
and their connection to regional, State, national, and international economic conditions,
it is possible to identify reasonable financial trends and provide a conceptual financial
picture for a multi-year period and is useful to the City’s decision-making. The Forecast
demonstrates the projected fiscal outlook for the GOF, including the adopted budget
changes for Fiscal Year 2014-15.
In summary, the updated projections indicate continued improvement in the economic
recovery with increases in all major revenue categories (e.g., Property Taxes, Sales Tax,
Transient Occupancy Tax, and Utility Users Tax) until the next downturn in the

1-4

economic cycle which is projected to occur within this 10-year period. General
Operating Fund expenditures are projected with anticipated increases in health care
and significant increases in retirement costs beginning in Fiscal Year 2016-17.
Fiscal Year 2014-15 General Operating Fund
Revenues
Fiscal Year 2014-15 General Operating Fund revenues are adopted (including the
reclassification of the loan repayment and Development Services revenues) at $99.6
million. Without the reclassifications, Fiscal Year 2014-15 revenues would be 7.0
percent and 2.3 percent higher than Fiscal Year 2013-14 adopted and unaudited,
respectively. With the reclassifications, revenues are 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent higher
compared to Fiscal Year 2013-14 adopted and Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited revenues,
respectively. All major categories of revenues (e.g., Property Taxes, Sales Tax, and
Other Local Taxes, etc.) are projected to increase compared to the Fiscal Year 2013-14
Adopted Revenues. However, investment earnings continue to be very modest and are
projected to continue to decline as higher-yielding securities are reinvested in the
current lower-interest-rate environment.

the actual budget saving results were greater than adopted, with the exception of Fiscal
Year 2012-13. These budget savings were necessary to maintain a positive operating
budget due to actual revenue shortfalls compared to budget.

Expenditures
Fiscal Year 2014-15 General Operating Fund Expenditures are adopted at $100.0 million
(Gross total expenditures including $1.0 million to OPEB Trust and before budget
savings). This is a slight difference from the $99.9 million shown in the Proposed
Budget due to the reconciliation to the final Adopted Budget.
With the consolidation of development-related expenditures to the Development
Services Fund, expenditures are increasing 1.9 percent compared to the Fiscal Year
2013-14 Adopted Budget. However, without the consolidation, Fiscal Year 2014-15
expenditures would be 4.4 percent higher than Fiscal Year 2013-14 adopted. This
essentially represents a “status quo” budget which preserves current service levels with
minor increases to high-priority programs. Although service levels generally are not
increasing, the City’s costs continue to rise.

Fiscal Year 2014-15 Adopted Budget Changes
The City Council reviewed and adopted the following non-discretionary and
discretionary expenditure increases:
Non-Discretionary Increases
Non-discretionary increases totaling $367,200 are to fund existing and new required
operational costs, such as increases in City utility costs, PG&E, and information
technology software and hardware maintenance.
A complete listing of nondiscretionary items is included in the Miscellaneous Information section (see Page 7-6).
Key components are as follows:
•

City Utility Costs: $218,800
Provides increased funding for City utility services used by City departments.

•

PG&E Cost Increase: $110,000
Provides funding for PG&E’s rate increase and the addition of the new Teen
Center.

•

Software and Hardware Maintenance: $15,500
Provides funding for new and existing software and hardware that requires
annual maintenance or license contracts. This cost increase is primarily related to
the new WiFi to be installed at City facilities as a result of Google grant funds.

Discretionary Increases
New discretionary expenditures totaling $210,900 are to fund high-priority ongoing
programs. These new expenditures are offset by $175,000 in new revenues for a net
impact of only $35,900. A complete listing of discretionary items is included in the
Miscellaneous Information section (see Page 7-8). Key components are as follows:

$67,800 (offset by $124,000 reimbursement

Provides increased funding for Reserve Officer and Police Officer pay to work
Amphitheatre and Special events. Amphitheatre events are fully cost recovered
and include a 15.0 percent administrative fee.
•

Recreation City-Wide Event Programming:
sponsorship revenue)

$41,000 (offset by $25,000 in

Provides funding to continue City-wide events such as Thursday Night Live and
increased funding for events such as the Holiday Tree Lighting, Halloween Bash,
and Community Yard Sale as well as advertising, marketing of events, and to
replace banners on a four-year schedule.
•

Library Materials: $25,000
Provides increased funding for books and Library materials loaned to the public.

•

Aquatics Staffing: $21,000 (offset by $21,000 lesson revenue)
Provides increased funding for hourly staffing to provide lessons. This funding
brings the budget for staffing to current levels.

•

PERS Health Program (PEMHCA) Administrative Fee: $12,000
Provides funding for the PEMHCA administrative fee. This fee is assessed on the
monthly premium to cover administration of the program and cannot be included
in the health premiums.

•

Mountain View Police Activities League (MVPAL): $5,000
Provides funding for MVPAL. MVPAL is primarily a youth crime-prevention
program that relies on educational, athletic, and other recreational activities to
cement a bond between Police Officers and youth. Studies have shown that if a
young person respects a Police Officer on the ball field or in the classroom, the
youth is more likely to respect the laws that Police Officers enforce. Such respect is
beneficial to the youth, the Police Officer, the neighborhood, and the business
community. This budgeted amount will support various MVPAL programming
such as boxing, soccer, tennis, and other programing.

Council Procedures Committee (CPC) Recommendations: $2,800
Provides increased funding in the Council’s budget ($1,800 travel reserve account
and $1,000 for Mayors Innovation Project) as recommended by the CPC on April 8,
2014. The travel and training budget was reduced as part of the budget balancing
during this past recession while travel and training costs continued to rise. Rather
than increasing the individual Councilmember’s training budget, the CPC
recommended an increase in the reserve to make funds available, as needed, as
determined by the Mayor. The CPC also recommended including the membership
to the Mayors Innovation Project.

Limited-Period Expenditures
In the Proposed Budget, staff estimated a total of $6.5 million available for new limitedperiod expenditures from the Fiscal Year 2013-14 estimated operating balance and onetime revenues. Funding of $1.1 million for new limited-period items is included in the
Adopted Budget and are itemized in the Miscellaneous Information section (see Page 715). Some of the major items to be funded as limited-period expenditures are as
follows:
•

Housing Boomerang Funds: $191,800
The Cities Association of Santa Clara County, Housing Trust Silicon Valley, and
Silicon Valley Leadership Group have joined together to support regional efforts to
increase funding for affordable housing in our communities. As a result of the
dissolution of redevelopment agencies (RDAs) and the loss of the previous 20.0
percent housing set-aside for low- and moderate-income housing funds, the
proposal identifies two potential streams of revenue: (1) the one-time funds that
were unencumbered; and (2) the ongoing funds that are distributed to cities
previously directed to RDAs. These have been deemed “boomerang” funds. This
provides funding for the one-time unencumbered funds ($140,800) and 20.0
percent of the net ongoing funds ($51,000), to be reviewed annually.

•

Firefighter Recruits: $187,500
Provides funding for three Firefighter recruits to attend the Firefighter Academy
for three months and approximately one-month transition-to-shift period.

November 2014 Election: $167,000
Provides funding for the November 4, 2014 General Municipal Election ($100,000)
and additional funding to add the potential Charter Amendment Measure for
Council compensation ($67,000) to the ballot.

•

Mobility Coordinator Position: $150,000
Provides funding for a new Mobility Coordinator position. This is intended to be a
two-year, limited-term position to focus on furthering the Council goal to
“Improve Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility.” This new position will provide
expertise in developing policies, guidelines, and projects; support the
Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Committee (B/PAC); and provide input on private
development projects. It will also free up some staff resources in Traffic
Engineering and Transportation to focus on other priorities. A portion ($50,000) of
the annual funding is funded from the recently provided Google Bike and
Pedestrian grant.

•

Associate Civil Engineer—Traffic (0.65): $110,500
Provides funding for 0.65 FTE of an Associate Civil Engineer position (the other
0.35 FTE is funded from the Development Services and Shoreline Regional Park
Community Funds). This position will support the increased workload in the
Traffic Section due to the high levels of private development activity.

•

Communications Coordinator Position (0.50): $70,000
Continuation of funding for a half-time Communications Coordinator position
located in the City Manager’s Office.

•

Wind Down of Energy Upgrade Mountain View: $35,000
Provides funding for a six-month extension of the program through December 31,
2014. The goal would be to sign up 200 new program participants and an
additional reduction of 168,000 pounds of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This
program was originally funded by a Federal grant to December 31, 2012, and
extended through Fiscal Year 2013-14 with limited-period funding.

Community Choice Aggregation: $30,000
A presentation about the possible formation of a Community Choice Aggregation
(CCA) District by Santa Clara County cities was made at the March 2014 Cities
Association Board meeting. California State law allows cities and counties to pool
their residential, business, and municipal electricity loads and to purchase and/or
generate power on their behalf through the formation of a Joint Powers Agreement
(JPA) special district, or CCA. Energy transmission, distribution, repair, and
customer service functions remain with the local utility.
Undertaking a CCA feasibility study, at a projected cost of $60,000 to be shared by
interested jurisdictions, has been briefly discussed by agency representatives. The
cost per agency would depend on the number of participants. This provides
placeholder funding, not to exceed $30,000, for the City to participate in the
feasibility study.

•

Civica Website Training: $20,000
Continuation of funding for training of department users to enable them to
maintain the content of the redesigned website on an ongoing basis.

Council Team Building: $2,500
Provides funding for Council team building. With the 2014 election and three new
members joining the Council, funds are requested by the CPC for a Council team
building in early 2015.

General Fund Carryover Available for Allocation
The Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited GOF operating balance of $6.8 million (including the
$322,000 transferred to the General Fund Reserve to bring it to policy), in addition to
one-time revenues, expenditure savings, and the reimbursement from Development
Services, will fund the following items included in the Adopted Budget: $1.1 million
for new limited-period expenditures (excluding rebudgets), $1.5 million in nondiscretionary transfers to reserves ($1.2 million Compensated Absences Reserve, and
$300,000 Workers’ Compensation Reserve), $1.0 million to the Retirees’ Health OPEB
Trust, $1.0 million to Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), and $2.0 million to
the Capital Improvement Reserve. Staff will return to Council after the conclusion of
the fiscal-year-end audit with any final balances available for allocation.
OTHER MAJOR FUNDS
Other General Funds
Development (formerly Building) Services Fund
Building Services is a General Fund program, separated from the General Operating
Fund, in order to facilitate better tracking and accounting. This separation was set up to
allow for an effective way to match revenues and expenditures and to provide the
Building Inspection Division with sufficient support to sustain a consistent high level of
service throughout fluctuations of the development cycle. For Fiscal Year 2014-15, in
order to provide a more comprehensive picture of the development process and to
more accurately align all development-related revenues and expenditures, Council
approved the consolidation of all development-related functions within the City into a
Development Services Fund. Staff is working on developing two reserves for
Development Services, one for the funding of the next General Plan and another related
to technology, Green Building Code, and Strong Motion Instrumentation Program
(SMIP) fees.
Fiscal Year 2014-15 revenues are adopted at $9.4 million and expenditures at $12.6
million, including the consolidation of all aspects of development-related services. The
continuation of limited-period positions, as well as new limited-period positions, will

1-15

Page 16 of 21
continue to provide additional resources during a period of unusually high
development activity.
There are sufficient funds available to support these
expenditures.
Shoreline Golf Links Fund
Fiscal Year 2013-14 is the second full year of management of the golf course by
Touchstone Golf, LLC (Touchstone). Touchstone continues to improve the financial
status of golf course operations with higher rounds played and higher revenues. For
Fiscal Year 2014-15, revenues are adopted at $2.7 million, $129,000 higher than the prior
fiscal year adopted. Expenditures are adopted at $2.5 million, $103,000 higher than the
prior fiscal year adopted. The revenue over expenditure balance is expected to provide
a balance sufficient to transfer $225,000 to the City’s General Operating Fund.
Special Funds
Successor Agency to the Revitalization Authority Fund
As of January 31, 2012, under the Dissolution Act, all California redevelopment agencies
were dissolved and ceased to exist as public entities. The City elected to serve as the
Successor Agency and to also retain the housing assets and functions. The Successor
Agency proposed a comprehensive wind-down and dissolution plan that has been
approved by the County, Oversight Board, and the State Department of Finance (DOF).
The DOF has issued a Finding of Completion and the Long-Range Property
Management Plan (LRPMP), which includes the transfer of assets from the Successor
Agency to the City, including the properties and parking structures, has been approved.
The 2003 COPs have been called as of February 1, 2014. On April 22, 2014, the Council
authorized the City Manager to execute the Compensation Agreement on behalf of the
City. All the taxing entities have also approved the Compensation Agreement for the
allocation of revenues resulting from the parking structures. A final reconciliation of
the Successor Agency will be performed and any funds required will be transferred to
the County for distribution to the taxing entities.
Shoreline Regional Park Community Fund (Shoreline Community)
Operating revenues for the 2014-15 Fiscal Year are adopted at $29.4 million, $2.5 million
higher than the prior fiscal year adopted, but $3.9 million less than the prior fiscal year
unaudited actuals. This is primarily resulting from the inclusion of a projected
reduction in secured assessed value for some commercial property in anticipation of
Santa Clara County processing additional assessment appeals. Operating expenditures
are adopted at $26.7 million (excluding capital projects of $3.0 million and Retirees’

Health unfunded actuarial accrued liability of $403,000). The General Reserve, based on
25.0 percent of expenditures (similar to other reserves), is increasing to $4.9 million and
the Landfill Reserve is increasing from $2.0 million to $3.0 million (as part of the plan to
increase to $6.0 million over several years for a catastrophic event).
Utility Funds
The City’s enterprise utility funds are fully funded by the rates charged to customers;
there is no General Fund support to the utility funds. Utility rates charged by
governmental entities for water, sewer, and trash and recycling services are considered
property-related fees and are subject to the procedural requirements of Proposition 218,
Article XIII D, of the California Constitution. Proposition 218 (as now interpreted)
requires governmental agencies that charge for utility services to conduct a majority
protest hearing prior to adopting any changes in utility rates. A notification of the
proposed rate changes was mailed to all ratepayers on or before May 2, 2014. These
rates were subsequently adopted at the June 17, 2014 public hearing.
Water Fund
For Fiscal Year 2014-15, a 7.0 percent rate adjustment for the average cost of water and a
2.4 percent rate adjustment for the recycled water and meter rates are adopted. The rate
restructuring and increased water sales over the last fiscal year have improved the
financial position of this fund. Although the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission
(SFPUC) has adopted a 19.6 percent increase in wholesale water costs along with the
adopted 8.6 percent and 9.9 percent increases in Santa Clara Valley Water District
(SCVWD) treated and well water costs, respectively, and increases in City operating
costs, the fund is projected to maintain operations and an adequate reserve with the rate
increases adopted.
Fiscal Year 2014-15 adopted revenues, with the adopted rate adjustments and assuming
a 10.0 percent reduction in water use due to drought conditions, are $28.5 million and
adopted operating expenditures are $25.8 million (after eliminating capital projects and
the budget effect of depreciation expense). Included in expenditures are the rate
adjustments to wholesale water costs. The operating balance of $2.7 million is to
partially fund capital projects of $2.9 million and increase in the reserve of $866,000 due
to higher expenditures primarily as a result of higher water costs. This results in a
reserve balance of $8.5 million and the Fiscal Year 2014-15 ending balance is projected to
be $9.3 million.

Honorable City Council

Wastewater Fund
For Fiscal Year 2014-15, a 2.0 percent overall rate increase is adopted due to the 2.8
percent increase from the Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plant (PARWQCP)
and City operating cost increases.
In addition to the 2.0 percent overall rate increase for operations, there are future capital
expenditures forecasted for the PARWQCP. The treatment plant began operations in
1972 and is in need of major renovations. The PARWQCP has provided staff with a
preliminary projection of the future costs necessary for the renovations and are
projecting costs to increase approximately $1.5 million annually in five years (Fiscal
Year 2018-19) and rise to a peak increase projection of $3.6 million annually in 13 years
(Fiscal Year 2026-27). This is the PARWQCP’s first estimate at quantifying costs and
will be revised as needed until the numbers are final. A cumulative rate increase of 20.0
percent is estimated to be needed to achieve the maximum annual $3.6 million. With
the advanced notice and planning, this allows for a gradual phase in of the rate
increases necessary to fund these long-term capital costs. Council approved a plan to
increase rates 2.0 percent annually for the next 10 years, attributable to the major
renovations for the PARWQCP. By phasing in the rates, this allows for an annual
gradual impact associated with the renovations of the treatment plant and spreads the
impact of the costs to the ratepayers who will be receiving the benefits of the
improvements.
With an overall 4.0 percent rate increase, revenues for Fiscal Year 2014-15 are adopted at
$15.9 million and operating expenditures at $14.4 million (after eliminating capital
projects and the budget effect of depreciation expense). The operating balance of $1.5
million is to partially fund capital projects of $2.4 million. This results in a Fiscal Year
2014-15 projected ending balance of $5.7 million and a reserve balance of $6.3 million,
including the accumulation of the 2.0 percent rate increase for PARWQCP capital costs.

Solid Waste Management Fund
For Fiscal Year 2014-15, a 1.1 percent increase is provided for the second year of the new
agreement with Recology. SMaRT® Station costs are adopted to increase 0.31 percent.
The revenues generated for trash and recycling services are based on trash service, and
as diversion opportunities increase, consumers will continue to reduce service levels for
trash, resulting in lower total revenues. However, the cost to pick up and haul both
recycling and trash remains and increases with inflation. In addition, rates are charged
based on volume while disposal costs are based on weight.
Based on the 1.1 percent increase for Recology, the 0.31 percent increased operating
costs for the SMaRT Station, as well as increases in the cost of City programs and the
annual maintenance projects, an overall average 2.0 percent rate increase is adopted for
Fiscal Year 2014-15. Based on preliminary indications from the Cost of Services Study
in progress, cart, debris box, and compactor rates are adopted to increase 3.0 percent
and 1.0 percent increase for bin rates in order to phase in aligning rates with the cost of
service. With a 3.0 percent cart rate increase, the rate for a 32-gallon cart increases by 70
cents a month to $23.30 per month.
Revenues for Fiscal Year 2014-15 are adopted at $12.1 million ($25.8 million including
Recology) and operating expenditures are adopted at $11.9 million ($25.6 million
including Recology). There is also funding of $295,000 for capital projects. The fund is
projected to end the 2014-15 fiscal year with a reserve at the policy level of $3.0 million
and a $2.1 million ending balance.
Reserves
Most reserves are established pursuant to Council Policy A-11, Financial and Budgetary
Policy, and others have been approved as needed by Council (see summary in
Miscellaneous section, Page 7-42). Reserves can be classified as those designated for a
specific purpose, and others are to fund liabilities. Most reserves are at or exceed their
target or policy balance. The Fiscal Year 2013-14 General Operating Fund balance
provided a supplement for the General Fund Reserve of $322,000 to bring this reserve to
policy level.
Council approved the Compensated Absences and Workers’
Compensation Reserves receive supplements of $1.4 million and $800,000, respectively.
In addition, $1.0 million is approved to be contributed to the Retirees’ Health Trust, an
additional $1.0 million to PERS, and up to $2.0 million allocated to the Capital
Improvements Reserve.

CITY COUNCIL MAJOR GOALS
The City Council undertook a comprehensive goal-setting process to establish its major
goals for a two-year cycle, Fiscal Years 2013-14 and 2014-15. This process included City
Council Study Sessions, input from Council advisory bodies, with adoption of the Fiscal
Year 2013-14 Budget. Council reaffirmed the three overarching major goals and
adopted three new goals and 19 new projects on June 17, 2014 as part of the Fiscal Year
2014-15 Budget.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
After four years of weathering structural deficits by thoughtfully addressing and
selectively reducing expenditures, establishing more efficient operating models,
working closely with employee organizations to limit increases in employee
compensation costs, as well as implementing revenue enhancements where
appropriate, Fiscal Year 2013-14 was the first year since the recession without budget
reductions. Strong revenue growth now has the General Operating Fund in a good
financial position. Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited revenues are $4.5 million, or 4.6
percent higher than adopted revenues. Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited expenditures are
$3.1 million lower than budget, achieving the adopted budget savings of $2.8 million.
The unaudited operating balance, after taking into consideration grants and donations,
balance rebudgets and changes in encumbrances, is $6.8 million for Fiscal Year 2013-14.
For Fiscal Year 2014-15, the adopted GOF revenues are projected to increase by $6.8
million compared to the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget without the
reclassification of revenue and adjustment for development-related services. Adopted
GOF expenditures are projected to increase by $4.3 million, including modest
expenditure increases in high-priority areas without the adjustment for developmentrelated services. The GOF is projected with an operating balance of $2.7 million for
Fiscal Year 2014-15 which will fund a transfer of $1.0 million to the OPEB Trust.
Although there are other areas where additional ongoing resources could be added,
more were not proposed during the budget process as the Forecast does not support
additional expenditures. Very modest surpluses are projected for the following two
fiscal years and operating deficits are projected to begin again when the next economic
downturn occurs.
We would like to express our appreciation to all staff for their cooperation and
assistance in the development of this budget. In particular, we want to thank the
Department Heads and Budget Team, with special thanks to Assistant Finance and
Administrative Services Director Suzy Niederhofer, Principal Financial Analyst Helen
Ansted, and Financial Analysts Elliot Young and Rafaela Duran for their assistance with

SUBJECT:

Fiscal Year 2014-15 Proposed Fee Modifications

INTRODUCTION
As part of the annual budget process, departments review their fees and prepare
recommendations to modify current fees, add new required fees, and eliminate any
unnecessary fees. If there are services provided that specifically benefit a particular
segment of the population versus more global services that generally benefit the entire
community, a fee may be calculated and recommended to Council to recover all or a
portion of the cost of providing the service. The Master Fee Schedule, the complete
listing of all City fees, will be updated to reflect Council actions on June 17, 2014
pertaining to fees, and then published for Fiscal Year 2014-15.
BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS
Each fee proposed to be modified, added, or eliminated is listed on the attached
Exhibits A through K, detailing the current and proposed amounts, fee basis, and
effective date. The fee proposals are summarized below and if the fee is not a General
Operating revenue source, the applicable fund is identified. This is not a complete
listing of all City fees, only those that are proposed as new or to be modified in some
manner.
City-Wide (Exhibit A)
The Council has previously authorized the Finance and Administrative Services
Director to modify the janitorial fee in accordance with any changes in the janitorial

contract. The change of janitorial services provider resulted in a revision to the hourly
rate and is included with the recommendations for informational purposes.
A fee for information requested on a memory stick is proposed at the price the City
pays for memory sticks.
City Attorney’s Office (Exhibit B)
General Operating Fund
The City contracts with the Silicon Valley Animal Control Authority (SVACA) to
provide animal adoption, control, and licensing services and SVACA establishes the
fees for these services. On April 8, 2014, Council adopted the proposed Animal
Ordinance which included optional five-year licenses for cats. These fees have been
added to the Fiscal Year 2014-15 fee proposals for Council consideration as SVACA
does not offer a five-year cat license. Vicious Animal Permits are proposed to be
replaced with a Dangerous Dog Permit and the fee increased.
The Code Compliance Inspection Fee has not been modified since 2009 and the
Document Review for CC&Rs, Easements, and Other Documents Related to Permits,
Licenses Fee is proposed to decrease, reflecting a change in the review process.
City Manager’s Office (Exhibit C)
General Operating Fund
Film/Photo Permits fees are proposed as the demand for this type of permit is growing
and the permitting process utilizes staff resources.
Community Development Department (Exhibit D)
Housing Impact Fund
The City Code and Resolution 17748 stipulate that Housing Impact fees and Rental
Housing Impact fees, respectively, shall be increased by the annual June 30 Consumer
Price Index (CPI) as part of the City’s annual budget process.

History
Mountain View began as a stagecoach stop and an
agricultural center for the lush Santa Clara Valley.
The town was incorporated in 1902 with a
population of fewer than 1,000 people. Once
covered in orchards and vineyards, by 1960 with
the growth of the electronic and aerospace
industries, the City of Mountain View's (City)
population had exploded to over 30,000. In 2010,
the population was 74,066.

Castro Street, 1904

Today
Mountain View is a modern, high-tech city that retains quiet neighborhoods and a
historic downtown core. While Mountain View is keeping pace with new ideas and
innovations, the City is also committed to the traditional values of strong
neighborhoods and citizen involvement. Mountain View is comprised of a variety of
distinct, locally organized neighborhood and homeowners associations which help
identify the community's needs and shape the City's future. In 2009, Forbes Magazine
named Mountain View fourth in “America’s Top 25 Places to Live Well”.
In recent years, the City has
developed some of the finest
recreation facilities the San
Francisco Bay Area has to
offer. The City's extensive
park

GENERAL OPERATING FUND
10-YEAR LONG-RANGE FINANCIAL FORECAST
INTRODUCTION
The practice of forecasting is an important part of a city’s financial planning process.
While it is challenging to accurately forecast local government revenues due to the
variable nature of the revenue sources and their connection to regional, State, national,
and even international economic conditions, it is possible to identify reasonable
financial trends and provide a conceptual financial picture for a multi-year period and
is useful to the City’s decision-making.
Annually, a five-year forecast is prepared and presented to the City Council during the
budget process. Beginning with the Fiscal Year 2008-09 budget process, the City
Council set as a high-priority goal the development of a 10-year forecast. The 5-year
forecast is prepared annually and a 10-year Long-Range Financial Forecast is prepared
periodically (every 2 to 4 years), and initially discussed with City Council during the
Narrative Budget Study Session. This report is a 10-year Long-Range Financial Forecast
(Forecast) for the time period of Fiscal Years 2014-15 through 2023-24.
A financial forecast, even with fluctuating economic variables, can help identify longterm financial trends, causes of fiscal imbalances, future fiscal challenges, opportunities,
and potential requirements, all of which may assist in continuing on a path of fiscal
sustainability. Growth and development will occur at a different pace than anticipated
in this Forecast and actual revenues and expenditures in future years will vary, but
trend lines will be apparent. This forecast provided a foundation for the City Council’s
decision-making for Fiscal Year 2014-15 budget deliberations. The Forecast is focused
on the General Operating Fund (GOF), which provides financing for the majority of
City services, including Police, Fire, Parks, Recreation, Library, and administrative
functions necessary for ongoing City operations. The GOF is also the fund that is most
influenced by economic conditions.
BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS
The Forecast is based on reasonable assumptions utilizing available information from a
wide variety of sources. These sources include reviewing the City’s historical trends,
gathering information from economists that specialize in the regional economics of
Silicon Valley, reviewing various indicators (e.g., unemployment data, etc.), networking
with staff of neighboring agencies, reviewing State of California (State) and national
economic trends, and factoring in known Mountain View conditions, such as economic
and property development. Other factors considered are the estimated growth in the
recovery from the latest recession, as well as the impact of the next cyclical economic
downturn. Confidence levels in the Forecast assumptions become more uncertain with

each subsequent fiscal year and actual future revenues and expenditures will vary from
the Forecast. The current level of City services, staffing, and cost of operations
projected for Fiscal Year 2014-15 is the base year for the forecast of subsequent fiscal
years’ expenditures.
The trend, based on the assumptions utilized, including the Adopted Budget, and
assuming $2.0 million annual budget savings, indicate revenues in Fiscal Year 2014-15
through Fiscal Year 2018-19 will exceed expenditures. It is projected there will be a
general slowdown in economic activity at some point during the 10-year forecast
period, but it is uncertain as to when it will occur. Historically, slowdowns in the
economy have been about every 10 years in the past four decades, with the exception of
the Great Recession which occurred only 6 years after the dot-com bust. It has been
approximately 6.5 years since the beginning of the last recession; therefore, the next
cycle could occur sooner than projected. The Forecast projects the impacts of the next
slowdown beginning in Fiscal Year 2019-20.
The various GOF revenue sources respond differently to such an economic event—
some, such as Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT), react almost immediately and others,
such as property taxes, sales tax, and investment earnings, lag behind. While the
budget is essentially balanced until the next recession, the projected operating balance is
a negative $3.0 million for Fiscal Year 2019-20 and grows to a negative $10.5 million in
Fiscal Year 2021-22, recovering slightly to a negative $9.5 million by the end of the 10year period. Although the Forecast projects an unbalanced budget, it is not the intent
that the City would adopt a deficit budget during these fiscal years, but rather is to
highlight the trends that are projected to occur if no actions are taken. The Forecast
allows for planning and actions to be taken in advance of the deficit occurring.
The 2030 General Plan projects the residential population of the City will be
approximately 82,000 by the year 2021. This 5,740 (7.5 percent) increase in population is
not anticipated to require a significant increase in the levels of services currently
provided. Similar population growth has been experienced in recent history and did
not result in a significantly increased demand for services. There were service level
increases, but these stemmed from the result of programs deemed desirable for creation
or enhancement—partnerships with the local school districts and/or the addition of
parks and facilities.
The following chart shows historical population annually for the past 10 years and each
U.S. Census year back to 1960 and projects population growth to 2020. From the 2000
Census to the 2010 Census, the City of Mountain View population grew by 2,697 (3.8
percent).

Economic Climate Factors
There are factors which impact each individual revenue source, some of which have
broad ranges affecting multiple revenues and some are specific to an individual
revenue source. The Forecast includes a discussion of these economic factors below:
Unemployment
As detailed in the chart below, Mountain View’s unemployment level has been below
the County of Santa Clara (County), State, and nation, except during the recession of the
early 2000s, which hit Silicon Valley the hardest. As of June 2014, unemployment in the
City is at 4.0 percent, close to the prerecession rate of 3.4 percent and well below the
County (5.4 percent), the State (7.4 percent), and the nation (6.1 percent).

State of California
After a decade of budgetary imbalances resulting in State employee furloughs and
staffing reductions, and deep cuts to social programs including all levels of education,
the Fiscal Year 2014-15 Adopted State Budget advances a multi-year plan that is
balanced, pays down budgetary debt from prior years, saves for a rainy day, and sets
forth a plan for fully funding the teacher pension system. The revenue generated from
the increase in sales tax, approved by the voters with the passage of Proposition 30 in
November 2012, allows for continued investment in schools. The recovering economy
is allowing for increased spending in the areas of environment, judiciary, public safety,
health care, CalWORKs, and affordable housing.
There are, however, ongoing State impacts to the City—Educational Revenue
Augmentation Fund (ERAF) losses, diversion of Vehicle License Fees (VLF), deferral/
elimination of State mandate reimbursements, elimination of public library funding,
and dissolution of redevelopment agencies.
Revenue and Expenditure Overview
In order to maintain a base level of services, revenue growth is necessary. If the existing
revenue base cannot generate sufficient revenues to fund the cost of operations, the
economic base must be enhanced or operating costs reduced. The Fiscal Year 2014-15
adopted revenues are projected to increase $2.1 million (2.1 percent) compared to Fiscal
Year 2013-14 adopted revenues.
The Adopted Budget includes the reclassification of the final two years of the Shoreline
Regional Park Community loan repayment from the GOF to the General NonOperating Fund. Since there are only two years remaining, it is no longer considered
“operating” revenue and will be used for one-time purposes. Also included is the
consolidation of all development-related activities into the Development Services Fund
(formerly Building Services). Adjusting for the reclassification of the loan repayment
and development-related services revenues, General Operating Fund revenues are 7.0
percent higher than the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted.
Fiscal Year 2014-15 adopted expenditures are $1.7 million (1.8 percent) higher compared
to the Fiscal Year 2013-14 adopted expenditures. However, adjusting for consolidation
of development-related services, expenditures are 4.4 percent higher than Fiscal Year
2013-14 Adopted. The increases in expenditures are primarily related to cost-of-living
adjustments (COLAs), retirement, and health-care benefit cost increases. Included is
$578,000 in new adopted expenditures for high-priority areas. After allowing for
anticipated budget savings of $2.0 million, the operating balance is projected to be $2.7
million at the end of Fiscal Year 2014-15.

Return to Previous

After four years of budget reductions and revenue enhancements to maintain a
structurally balanced budget, the City is experiencing strong economic recovery and is
in a strong financial position with a surplus projected for the next few fiscal years.
Therefore, given resources that have not been available in recent years, Council
approved allocation of $1.0 million annually to Other Post-Employment Benefits
(OPEB) (i.e., retirees’ health), for the current fiscal year and Fiscal Year 2015-16.
Although there have been changes made to reduce the cost of current health benefits
with the move of public safety employees to PERS Health Program (PEMHCA), there is
still an anticipated increase in the overall retirees’ health liability. In addition, the move
to a lower discount rate of 7.0 percent has increased this liability.
Fiscal Year 2014-15 includes a contractual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) and Fiscal
Year 2015-16 includes a modest COLA, but there are no COLAs included in the
subsequent eight fiscal years of the forecast period. The contract extension with the
Mountain View Firefighters (MVFF) approved on July 1, 2014 has not been reflected in
this Forecast. However, the entire forecast period does include amounts for annual step
and merit increases, as well as projected annual benefit cost increases. Projected cost
increases in Salary and Benefits range from $2.4 million to $3.8 million annually. The
percentage of the GOF devoted to benefits has increased from 18.1 percent to 25.1
percent over the past decade. In addition, Supplies and Services are projected to
increase by an average of $416,000 annually for inflationary and nondiscretionary
increases.
The following table includes the projected revenues and expenditures by category for
Fiscal Year 2014-15 and the subsequent forecast years.

Revenue and Expenditure Background
Revenues
Historical experience demonstrates Mountain View has a relatively volatile revenue
base, primarily related to sales tax, with substantial variation in the amount of revenues
collected over time (see Attachment 1 for revenue and expenditure history). There is a
strong correlation between economic conditions and the amount of revenues received.
In addition to the overarching factors described in the Economic Climate Factors
section, the City’s revenue volatility is continually impacted by local factors.
For Fiscal Year 2014-15, all the main categories of General Operating Fund revenues are
projected to meet or exceed the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget, excluding the
impact of the consolidation of development-related activity and reclassification of the
Shoreline loan repayment. Significant factors, such as increasing property values, hotel
rates and occupancy, and improved compliance with the City’s Utility Users Tax (UUT)
Ordinance are contributing to an improved financial condition and an overall indication
the City is continuing its recovery from the recession.
A history of total General Operating Fund Revenues is as follows (dollars in

Total Fiscal Year 2014-15 adopted revenues are projected to increase $2.1 million (2.1
percent) compared to the Fiscal Year 2013-14 adopted, including the adjustments to
revenues. Adjusting for the reclassification of the loan repayment and developmentrelated services revenues, revenues are 7.0 percent higher than the Fiscal Year 2013-14
Adopted. Additional discussion of individual revenue sources can be found later in
this report.
Expenditures
During Fiscal Years 2009-10 through 2012-13, there were projected structural deficits
ranging from $1.1 million to $6.0 million and, through a combination of operating
efficiencies and expenditure reductions (totaling $7.4 million), revenue enhancements,
and employee cost containment (totaling $2.2 million), the City was able to weather the
Great Recession. Revenues had recovered sufficiently and no budget restructuring was
necessary for the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget. The projection for Fiscal Year
2014-15 also indicated there would be sufficient funding for the adopted expenditures.
However, from the peak in Fiscal Year 2001-02, the GOF employee count has been
reduced by over 70.0 positions (over 14.0 percent). Overall, the City is operating at a
very lean staffing level for the quality and level of services provided.
The Forecast expenditures are calculated in the same manner as the annual budget and
include the full cost of each existing position (Salary and Benefits), adjusted based on
compensation as approved by City Council in the various Memorandums of
Understanding (MOUs) and employee agreements and multi-year assumptions related
to each component of cost (e.g., steps, merits, retirement, health care, etc.). The factors
for future health benefit costs were based on health-care trends and historical
experience. The projected California Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) rates
for Fiscal Years 2014-15 through 2019-20 were provided by PERS, but adjusted by staff
for the projected impacts of the changes to demographic assumptions recently adopted
by the PERS Board. The remaining fiscal years were projected internally (see Salaries
and Benefits section).
For Supplies and Services and the remaining categories, a base level of expenditures is
calculated utilizing the Fiscal Year 2014-15 Adopted Budget and then adjusted based on
the multi-year assumptions related to each component of cost (e.g., City utilities,
equipment maintenance, self-insurance funding, etc.).
Based on past experience, it is typical to underspend the budget due to vacant positions
and cost containment in Supplies and Services accounts. Therefore, budget savings of
$2.0 million is assumed for each fiscal year of the forecast period.

SUMMARY
Silicon Valley continues to be a leader in the economic recovery—job creation, vacant
space utilization, and development of both residential and commercial projects are
contributing to the health of the economy. Although anticipated PERS rate increases
and medical rate increases are significant factors in cost increases, the Forecast projects
sufficient revenue growth until the next recession occurs. Beyond Fiscal Year 2014-15,
the forecast years continue to indicate a minimal positive operating balance
(anticipating continued revenue growth and after allowing for the $2.0 million in
budget savings, but does not account for any cost-of-living adjustments after Fiscal Year
2015-16) until the next economic downturn hits. Future economic challenges ahead
appear to be dependent upon the strength of the economy.
Following is a detailed and graphic presentation of the Forecast, summarizing the
assumptions and resulting revenues and expenditures.

PROPERTY TAXES

Property Taxes include the revenue generated from the City’s share of the 1.0 percent
levy assessed on the taxable value of real and personal property located within the City
limits. The assessed value (AV) of secured real property that does not experience a
change in ownership or is not subject to new construction is increased annually at a rate
not to exceed the California Consumer Price Index (CCPI) or 2.0 percent, whichever is
lower. However, if a property changes ownership, it is reassessed (up or down) at the
current market value and new construction is initially valued at the cost of the
construction. In addition, the County Assessor can proactively adjust the AV of
properties downward to market value during periods of declining property values.
Unsecured tax on personal property, such as computers and other equipment, is
assessed on the value of the property as reported annually to the County by the owning
business.

State legislation regarding tax allocation.

HISTORY
In 1992, as a way of solving its own budget shortfall, the State enacted legislation that
shifted partial financial responsibility for funding education to local government.
Property tax revenues belonging to cities, counties, and special districts were shifted to
the ERAF. The net cumulative loss to the GOF resulting from all ERAF shifts through
Fiscal Year 2013-14 exceeds $78 million (in excess of $81.0 million for the entire City).
For the past two decades, housing activity has remained strong with short periods of
uncertainty or declines related to the availability of housing stock, interest rates, and the
overall economy. During Fiscal Year 2008-09, the housing market collapsed and
assessed valuation across the County suffered and caused some properties to be
appraised at less than the outstanding debt on the property. In Fiscal Years 2010-11 and
2011-12, the annual CCPI was 0.237 percent and 0.753 percent, respectively. During that
time, foreclosures increased dramatically nationwide as homeowners defaulted on their
mortgages and California was the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis. The ripple effects
included significant losses in the stock market and property values, business closures or
tightening of spending, layoffs, an abrupt halt to construction activity and housing
sales, and a tightening of credit, many of which contributed to foreclosure rates. The
number of foreclosure starts in California has declined significantly, down 60.0 percent
compared to 2012. From January 2008 through December 2013, there were 237
foreclosures in the City, 1.1 percent of the total foreclosures in the County, and this also
had a negative impact to the City’s tax roll. The number of foreclosures has fallen
dramatically in both the County and the City, with only eight in Mountain View in
2013.
Beginning Fiscal Year 2008-09, the County began processing Proposition 8 (Prop 8)
reductions for residential and commercial properties. The Fiscal Year 2013-14 tax roll
included significant restoration of value and removal of parcels from Prop 8 status—
57.7 percent net AV restoration compared to the Fiscal Year 2012-13, one of the highest
recovery levels in the County. This resulted in the generation of approximately
$500,000 additional property tax revenue for the 2013-14 fiscal year. The County is
currently completing the annual review process of residential and commercial
properties to determine the restoration for Fiscal Year 2014-15. County staff continues
to review the remaining parcels in Prop 8 status in preparation for the July 1, 2014 tax
roll.

REMAINING
PROP 8 IMPACT

In the time period since the beginning of the recession, commercial property owners
have also submitted applications for value reductions. The number of appeals
submitted County-wide for 2013 is the lowest since 2008. Because of the variable nature
of commercial properties, the process of reviewing and valuing them is more
complicated and lengthy. The County processed County-wide AV roll reductions
(primarily the result of resolved appeals) and corrections totaling a net of $3.3 billion
through June 30, 2014. The General Fund’s share of this property tax revenue loss for
Fiscal Year 2013-14 is approximately $297,000. A significant number of pending appeals
still remain and these are anticipated to continue to negatively impact the City’s
property tax revenue. It is projected the potential at-risk AV is $240.0 million, which
would result in a property tax loss of $384,000 to the General Operating Fund.
However, some appeals are dismissed or granted a partial reduction.
The number of residential sales in the entire City during calendar year 2013 (most
recent information available) is one of the highest since tracking was initiated in 2007.
As detailed in the table below, there has been growth in the median price of singlefamily homes (SFH) with changes in ownership (CIO) beginning in 2010, with a more
significant increase in the SFH median price for sales which occurred in 2012 and 2013.

In total, Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited Property Tax revenue of $31.1 million exceeds
both the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget of $30.1 million and the Fiscal Year 201213 actual of $28.1 million.
FORECAST
The Fiscal Year 2014-15 projected secured property tax revenue is based on the Fiscal
Year 2013-14 tax roll adjusted for the following:
•

A 0.454 percent CCPI increase to the AV of all eligible residential and commercial
property;

•

Projected overall AV gain as a result of restoration of Prop 8 reductions net of loss
from resolution of pending appeals;

•

Value changes related to property transfers and sales prior to the lien date;

•

Increased AV projection related to new development and remodels; and

•

Share of property tax from the former Revitalization Authority.

Compared to the July 1, 2013 tax roll, these factors result in an overall 5.6 percent
growth in General Operating Fund secured assessed value.
As mentioned earlier, the County has a backlog of approximately 7,300 appeals. As the
County is not able to provide information about pending appeals specific to each local
agency, the Fiscal Year 2014-15 revenue includes a projection for Prop 8 restoration and
resolution of pending appeals, which result in a net 0.5 percent projected increase in the
total AV.

3-17

Return to Previous

For the remaining forecast years, total secured property tax is projected with net growth
ranging from 2.7 percent to 7.2 percent annually. These average annual increases
include an annual change in AV based on a 2.0 percent CCPI, new development
projects in the pipeline, anticipated growth from changes in ownership and remodeling,
and the City’s share of the projected property tax from the former Revitalization
Authority. At this time, there is no increased AV or property tax projected for The
Village at San Antonio Phase II, 700 East Middlefield Road, or Moffett Gateway
projects. Should Moffett Gateway proceed as expected, this could be a dedicated
revenue source for a major unfunded capital project, such as the Police/Fire
Administration Building.
Fiscal Year 2014-15 unsecured property tax revenue is projected at approximately the
same level as the Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited and the remaining forecast years are
projected to increase 1.0 percent annually through 2019-20. Unsecured tax is projected
to decline in the following two years, reflecting the impact of an anticipated downturn
in the economy and then recover in the final two fiscal years of the 10-year forecast.

SALES TAX

Sales Tax revenue is the second largest single revenue source of the GOF and also the
most volatile. The City of Mountain View is allocated 1.0 percent of every sales dollar
subject to sales tax. In the late 1990s, sales tax from commercial/industrial businesses
generated a greater amount of sales tax than retail businesses, an approximate 1.5:1
ratio. During the current decade, as a result of relocations and the recession, the ratio of
sales tax generated by commercial/industrial and retail businesses has changed and is
currently at an approximate 1:3 ratio.
SOURCES
•

Retail sales of tangible personal property to individuals and other businesses.

•

Use and excise taxes on business consumption of personal property.

•

State and County pooled sales tax allocated by population.

ECONOMIC FACTORS
•

Business expansion, reduction, or relocation.

•

State of the economy.

•

Purchasing patterns.

•

State Board of Equalization allocation decisions.

•

Level of business-to-business sales.

•

Technology changes.

HISTORY
Since the early 1990s, sales tax has been an extremely volatile revenue source, reaching
an all-time record high of $24.1 million in Fiscal Year 2000-01, primarily resulting from
high-tech businesses. A precipitous decline to $14.2 million occurred in Fiscal Year
2003-04 followed by steady growth through Fiscal Year 2007-08 to $17.3 million. These
variations typically occur as businesses move in and out of the City, companies modify
reporting and/or sales methods, and the economy changes. Fundamentally, as the
service economy grows and less manufacturing is done locally, there is a smaller
commercial tax base. As a result of the Great Recession, sales tax revenue fell in excess

3-21

Return to Previous

of $2.0 million (11.8 percent) to $15.2 million. Since then, sales tax revenue has again
steadily grown. The most recent sales tax data indicates there is net growth within
Santa Clara County, the nine Bay Area counties, and the State year over year. By the
end of the 2013-14 fiscal year, sales tax revenue to the City grew 1.1 percent to $16.9
million compared to Fiscal Year 2012-13 actual, but is below the 2013-14 fiscal year
adopted by 1.9 percent.
FORECAST
Fiscal Year 2014-15 Sales Tax revenue is projected with a net growth of 4.0 percent
compared to the Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited, the combination of projected continued
economic recovery of retail and building, the opening of the first phase of The Village at
San Antonio Center redevelopment, net of the loss due to the relocation of several
businesses out of the City. The subsequent forecast years include an anticipated annual
growth of 2.5 percent except Fiscal Years 2020-21 and 2021-22, which include a 10.0
percent annual decline resulting from a projected downturn in the economy. The
Forecast does not include increased sales tax for The Village at San Antonio Center
Phase II.

OTHER LOCAL TAXES

Other Local Taxes is comprised of Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT), Business License
Tax, and Utility Users Tax (UUT).
SOURCES
•

TOT is a 10.0 percent tax assessed on hotel and motel occupancies. Any occupancy
by a government employee, while on government business, or a stay exceeding 30
consecutive days, is exempt from the tax. This tax is self-reported on a quarterly
basis by hotels and motels within the City limits, and a compliance audit is
performed on a periodic basis.

•

Business License Tax is assessed on all businesses known to be operating in
Mountain View and billed annually. The tax rate varies by type of business,
generally $30 per year for most (73.0 percent of Mountain View businesses), but
can be as high as $630 for certain types of businesses.

•

UUT is a 3.0 percent tax assessed on the consumption of all telecommunication,
electricity, and gas services. Companies providing taxable utility services remit
UUT payments monthly and a compliance audit is performed on a periodic basis.

ECONOMIC FACTORS
•

TOT: Number of hotel rooms, room rate, occupancy rate, and number of
exemptions.

•

Business License Tax: Number and types of businesses licensed by the City and
the applicable tax rate.

•

UUT: Customer base, level of consumption, and price of the commodity.

HISTORY
TOT: The current tax rate is 10.0 percent, last modified in June 1991 from 8.0 percent.
Occupancy and room rates in the City typically grow in nonrecessionary times. The
impacts of economic downturns or disruptions are immediately felt in TOT revenue as
demonstrated after the dot-com bust and the Great Recession when TOT fell by 26.6
percent. TOT revenues began to recover from this last recession in spring 2010 and
growth has continued through June 2014.

3-25

Return to Previous

Business License Tax: This revenue does not change significantly from year to year as
the tax rate has remained essentially unchanged since June 1954 (excluding two
business types updated in 1985). In Fiscal Year 2012-13, approximately 5,600 business
licenses were issued. Fluctuation in the number of businesses does not significantly
change annual revenue because of the low annual tax.
UUT: The tax is calculated on the consumer cost of the energy (gas and electricity) and
telecommunication services utilized. The tax revenue fluctuates with the cost, customer
usage, and/or customer base and is negatively impacted by economic downturns as
businesses close and many customers reduce usage. In November 2010, the voters
approved a ballot measure which broadened the base to include all telecommunications
services in order to treat all customers equally and the amended ordinance became
effective March 2011. As a result, UUT generated from telecommunications increased.
An audit of the telecommunications providers was completed in January 2014 and
resulted in a $1.1 million settlement, one-time assessment payments, and new ongoing
revenue.
FORECAST
TOT: The growth phase is anticipated to continue at a reduced pace, reflecting a 6.0
percent increase for Fiscal Year 2014-15 compared to the Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited.
Growth continues in Fiscal Year 2015-16 and then growth slows through Fiscal Year
2018-19, declines 40.0 percent over the two-year anticipated downturn, and recovers by
the end of the forecast period. The Forecast does not include any increase in room
capacity from potential new hotels.
Business License Tax: The business license revenue is forecast with 1.0 percent annual
growth excluding the anticipated two-year downturn which includes a 10.0 percent
decline.
UUT: Total projected UUT revenue for Fiscal Year 2014-15 is 3.0 percent higher than the
Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited, reflecting increases in all sources. Excluding the
anticipated two-year recessionary period, annual growth of approximately 2.0 percent
is expected from telecommunications and energy usage during the forecast period as
there are major residential and commercial development projects in the pipeline which
will increase consumption.

USE OF MONEY AND PROPERTY

Use of Money and Property is comprised of investment earnings and revenue from
rents and leases of City property. Investment earnings are generated from the General
Fund’s share of the City’s pooled investment portfolio. Rents and Leases revenue is
generated from rental properties and lease agreements.
SOURCES
•

Monthly interest allocation generated by the City’s pooled investment portfolio.

•

HISTORY
Investment Earnings: Over the past decade, part of the City’s financial strategy was to
build reserves in anticipation of budget constraints in order to generate additional
revenue in the form of investment earnings and to maintain sufficient funds to weather
any further significant declines in revenues. The Federal Reserve has aggressively

3-28

Return to Previous

managed short-term interest rates since 2006 in an effort to combat the ripple effect of
the subprime lending crisis and support the economic recovery by reducing the Federal
funds rate from 5.25 percent to the current target of 0.25 percent. This has significantly
impacted the City’s interest earnings.
Rents and Leases: Over time, the City has strategically developed City-owned
properties and negotiated lease agreements which generate long-term revenue for the
General Operating Fund. These leases and the revenue generated become even more
important during economic downturns as they do not immediately fluctuate with the
economy, and most include annual inflationary increases.
In 1995, 1996, and 2008, the City first negotiated and signed ground lease agreements
for the North Charleston, Crittenden, and Charleston East sites, respectively. As
allowed in the ground leases, the market rent includes fixed annual increases and is
revalued every 10 years.
In late Fiscal Year 2005-06, Council approved the amended and restated lease between
the City and SFX Entertainment, Inc. (operating company of Live Nation, Inc.), for the
lease of the Shoreline Amphitheatre. The terms of the lease eliminated the percentage
rent structure and replaced it with a fixed amount of $200,000 per month for the concert
season (nine months), a total of $1.8 million annually.
In September 2007, CVS opened in the Bryant Street parking structure and began
paying the City the negotiated monthly lease rent. The annual lease revenue is
currently $283,000 ($243,000 to the GOF and $40,000 to the Parking District to offset
maintenance costs).
In May 2010, Savvy Cellars opened to the public at the Centennial Plaza Train Depot
and, in accordance with the lease, the annual revenue to the City for the first five years
is $29,700.
In April 2011, the City executed a long-term (52 years) ground lease with Google Inc. for
the other portion of the Charleston East site which became effective in June 2011, and
Google remitted $30.0 million in prepaid rent to the City which is invested and
generates annual investment earnings
FORECAST
Investment Earnings: The Fiscal Year 2014-15 projection is based on the assumption
that as instruments mature, the funds will be reinvested at rates slightly higher than
those available in Fiscal Year 2013-14. Fiscal Year 2014-15 projects the average portfolio
yield declines to 1.16 percent as the last of the high-yielding instruments mature in 2014
and the projected rates, although higher than Fiscal Year 2013-14, are lower than the

3-29

Return to Previous

maturing securities. This assumes the Federal funds rate target remains at 0.25 percent
through 2014, and the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) pooled rate averages 0.30
percent. The City’s average portfolio yield is anticipated to begin rising in Fiscal Year
2015-16 as a result of the progressively increasing rates and reinvestment of loweryielding instruments upon maturity. The average portfolio yield is projected to
continue rising, although more slowly at the end of the forecast period as a result of the
anticipated economic downturn.
The $1.1 million investment earnings projected to be generated from the Google prepaid
rent was based on an average annual yield of 3.5 percent. However, the low-interestrate environment has lasted longer than initially anticipated and the lease revenue
transfer is kept at the $750,000 level. Once interest rates begin to rise, the amount
available will be reevaluated.
Rents and Leases: Three of the leases with Google include 3.0 percent or 4.0 percent
annual increases and all will have a revaluation during the forecast period. The fairmarket value of the Crittenden and Charleston East leases are projected to be less in the
year they are revalued than the projected lease rents for that year. Overall, annual lease
revenue from Google is not projected to decline as the other leases have annual
inflationary increases.
The City receives $1.8 million annually from SFX Entertainment, Inc., for lease of the
Shoreline Amphitheatre through Fiscal Year 2016-17 and 2.0 percent annual contractual
increases begin the following fiscal year. The lease agreement with CSMA includes an
increase effective during Fiscal Year 2018-19. The Savvy Cellars lease provides for an
increase in Fiscal Year 2015-16. The parking structure was partially funded with former
Revitalization Authority (Authority) funds and, based on the agreement to wind down
the affairs of the former Authority, any revenues generated from the parking structures
are shared with the taxing entities in the same portion of the Authority’s contribution to
the structures. The Compensation Agreement is effective July 1, 2014, resulting in a loss
of $118,000 annually. In Fiscal Year 2017-18, the CVS lease agreement provides for an
11.9 percent increase. The remaining lease agreements will remain essentially level.

LICENSES, PERMITS, AND FEES/FINES AND FORFEITURES

This revenue category is comprised of Licenses and Permits, Franchise Fees, and Fines
and Forfeitures.
SOURCES
•

Licenses and Permits revenues are generated from businesses requiring specific
City permits.

•

Franchisees are required to pay Franchise Fees as compensation to the City for the
use of City property while providing a commercial service to Mountain View
businesses and residents.

•

Fines and Forfeitures are generated from citations issued by the City and the
California Highway Patrol.

ECONOMIC FACTORS
•

State of the economy.

•

Franchise agreements and revenues generated by franchisees.

•

Level of development activity.

•

State and Federal regulations, legislation, and funded programs.

HISTORY
Licenses, Permits, and Fees: Licenses and Permits revenue tends to fluctuate with the
development cycle. In Fiscal Year 2006-07, Building Services was separated from the
General Operating Fund to better facilitate tracking and accounting. For several years
after, revenue in this category (not related to Building Services) was level, but has
grown with development activity of the past several years.
Franchise Fee revenue generated from gas and electricity usage has historically
increased as a result of significant commercial and residential development and
declined during economic downturns as a result of commercial office vacancies.
In accordance with the agreement between the City and the City’s trash and recycling
collector, Recology, a monthly service fee is owed to the City. This fee includes a
portion for the exclusive right to perform this activity and a portion is attributable to

3-33

Return to Previous

other solid waste services. This revenue has fluctuated over the past decade as a result
of conservation efforts, migration to larger-size containers, and increases in refuse
service charges in addition to the economic reasons listed above.
Beginning in Fiscal Year 2011-12, Cable Franchise revenues were budgeted directly as
General Fund Franchise revenue in lieu of a transfer from the Cable Fund. In total,
Franchise Fee revenue has been growing since Fiscal Year 2009-10.
Fines and Forfeitures: This revenue source includes false alarm fees, and bail/fine
payments from the County and parking violation payments and has been growing
steadily since Fiscal Year 2005-06.
FORECAST
Licenses, Permits, and Fees: Fiscal Year 2014-15 Licenses and Permits revenue is
projected to be $502,000 lower than the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget, reflecting
the impact of consolidating all development activities into a Development Services
Fund. The remainder of the forecast period includes average annual increases of less
than 1.0 percent excluding the decline over the two-year economic downturn. The
Forecast includes average annual increases of 2.8 percent for Franchise Fees, excluding
the 9.6 percent decline for the anticipated two-year economic downturn.
Fines and Forfeitures: Average annual increases of 2.3 percent are included for Fines
and Forfeitures over the forecast period.

INTERGOVERNMENTAL

Intergovernmental revenue is remitted or allocated to the City by other governmental
agencies.
SOURCES
•

Other governmental agencies—Santa Clara County, State of California, and U.S.
government.

ECONOMIC FACTORS
•

Actions by the State Legislature.

•

State and Federal regulations, legislation, and funded programs.

HISTORY
During the past decade, many revenues from the State have been reduced or
eliminated, including Vehicle License Fees (VLF), Community-Oriented Policing
Services (COPS), Public Library Funds, Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team
(REACT), SB 90 mandate reimbursement, and other programs. The Fiscal Year 2013-14
unaudited revenue exceeds the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget and the Fiscal Year
2012-13 actual.
FORECAST
Fiscal Year 2014-15 projected revenue declines compared to Fiscal Year 2013-14
unaudited, primarily as Fiscal Year 2014-15 does not include one-time grant funds or
mandate reimbursements that were received in the 2013-14 fiscal year. The remaining
forecast years include small incremental increases to several reimbursements from the
County and the end of Regional Auto Theft Task Force (RATTF) funding in Fiscal Year
2019-20.

CHARGES FOR SERVICES

Charges for Services revenue is comprised of revenue from fees for services provided
by various City departments, primarily related to recreation and development activities.
SOURCES
•

City Recreation programs.

•

Private development activity.

•

Other provided services.

ECONOMIC FACTORS
•

State of the economy.

•

Level of participation in City Recreation programs.

•

Level of development activity.

HISTORY
Historically, revenue generated from private development has fluctuated with the cycle
of development activity, experiencing declines when the economy has faltered. During
the past few years, activity has increased more significantly with the recovery of the
economy.
In order to ensure appropriate pricing for services, several years ago staff completed a
Police services cost-of-service study, and Council approved a Recreation Cost Recovery
Policy (Policy), increased recovery levels for services provided by other departments,
and adopted new or increased service fees. Since approval of the Policy, staff
completed an analysis of participation levels, revenues, and changes in programming
which indicated that participation levels decreased in some programs, utilization of the
fee waiver program increased (likely as a result of the struggling economy), and the
number of programs and classes were reduced as a result of minimum attendance
requirements authorized in the Policy. Staff continually reviews programming and
pricing and makes changes as appropriate. Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited revenue for
Recreation is 7.4 percent below budget, primarily as the contract instructor program is
not fully implemented. In total, unaudited Charges for Services revenue exceeds the
adopted budget as development-related revenue is higher than anticipated.

3-39

Return to Previous

FORECAST
Fiscal Year 2014-15 Charges for Services revenue is projected to be $1.6 million lower
than the Fiscal Year 2013-14 adopted budget, reflecting the consolidation of all
development activities into a Development Services Fund. The remainder of the
forecast period includes average annual increases of approximately 1.0 percent
excluding the anticipated two years of economic downturn.

INTERFUND REVENUES AND TRANSFERS

Interfund Revenues result from internal charges for staff time, building space, and
maintenance services provided to other funds and capital projects by the General
Operating Fund. The cost of this internal support provided to other funds is calculated
in the City’s Full Cost Allocation Plan (Plan). Interfund Transfers include transfers
between the GOF and a variety of other funds.
SOURCES
•

Interfund Revenues are reimbursements to the GOF for internal support services
provided to other funds and capital improvement projects.

•

Interfund Transfers are transfers from other City funds.

ECONOMIC FACTORS
•

Level and cost of services provided by GOF staff to other funds and capital
improvement projects.

HISTORY
Interfund Revenues: In the early 1990s, with the assistance of a cost plan consultant, the
City began preparing and utilizing a full cost plan for reimbursement to the GOF. The
Plan has been updated approximately every two to three years and this revenue source
accounts for approximately 11.0 percent of total GOF revenues.
Interfund Transfers: These vary from year to year, and are ongoing and one-time/
limited-period in nature. The Fiscal Year 2013-14 unaudited includes the annual
transfers from the Gas Tax and Parking District funds, $750,000 of investment earnings
from the Google prepaid rent, $45,000 of net operating income from Shoreline Golf
Links, and the final transfer from the PERS Reserve and the Successor Agency for the
Revitalization Authority.
FORECAST
Interfund Revenues:
For Fiscal Year 2014-15, Interfund Revenues include
reimbursement from various funds which receive support from the GOF. An update of
the Plan was recently completed and the results have been incorporated. Significant
changes compared to the 2013-14 fiscal year include elimination of administrative
reimbursement from the Successor Agency, an increase in reimbursement from the
Shoreline Community resulting from an allocation of a share of the full cost of Police

services, not just Patrol and Emergency Communications, and reduction in
reimbursement from the Development Services Fund as a result of the consolidation of
all development activities into the Development Services Fund. The remaining forecast
period includes small incremental annual increases.
Interfund Transfers: For Fiscal Year 2014-15, Interfund Transfers include $1.3 million of
reimbursement from the Gas Tax Fund, $750,000 of interest from the Google prepaid
rent, $225,000 of operating income from Shoreline Golf Links, and $108,000 of
reimbursement from the Parking District. The forecast period includes level or slightly
increasing transfers from the same funds.

LOAN REPAYMENTS

This revenue source reflects the annual repayment of loan obligations from other funds.
SOURCES
•

Shoreline Regional Park Community.

•

Revitalization Authority.

ECONOMIC FACTORS
•

Financial condition of the paying funds.

HISTORY
Shoreline Regional Park Community (Shoreline Community): The General Fund made
a series of loans to the Shoreline Community beginning in Fiscal Year 1985-86, which
eventually totaled $17.8 million. The loans were consolidated during Fiscal Year 198889. Because this revenue stream was long-term in nature, it has been included as
operating revenues.
Revitalization Authority (Authority): The General Fund made two loans to the
Authority during 1988 and 1989 to fund the Castro Street improvements. In Fiscal Year
2002-03, the loan was reamortized to 2019, the deadline for debt to be repaid by the
Authority at a 6.0 percent interest rate with an annual loan payment in the amount of
$165,500. AB 1484 dissolved all redevelopment agencies (RDA) throughout California
and subsequent legislation invalidated loans between RDAs and the cities that created
them.
FORECAST
Shoreline Community: As there are only two years of payments remaining, Council
adopted staff’s proposal to account for the final two payments in the General NonOperating Fund. The City’s past practice has been to align ongoing revenue with
ongoing expenditures. Although this loan was considered ongoing operating revenue
due to its long-term nature, as there are only two remaining payments, the loan is now
considered as one-time revenue.

SALARIES AND BENEFITS

The Salaries and Benefits category makes up the largest component of General
Operating Fund expenditures and represents all personnel-related costs. The City is
obligated by law to meet and confer with bargaining units and also meets with other
employees on matters of employee compensation. There are currently four recognized
bargaining groups in the City: the Police Officers Association (POA sworn and
nonsworn), the Mountain View Professional Firefighters Union (MVFF Local 1965), the
Service Employees International Union (SEIU Local 715), and the EAGLES
(Management, Professional, and certain Front-Line positions).
The remaining
employees include certain unrepresented Management, Professional, and Front-Line
positions. The outcome of negotiations with each group is a major factor in salary and
benefit costs.

HISTORY
Since Fiscal Year 2000-01, there have been two downturns in the economy necessitating
a net reduction of approximately 70 positions and employee compensation cost
containment. During Fiscal Year 2011-12, the City negotiated three-year contracts with
all employee groups that expire June 30, 2015. Cost-containment measures that became

3-53

Return to Previous

effective for Fiscal Year 2012-13 for all or some of the employee groups include
maximum vacation accruals, modified sick-leave incentive program, HMO medical
plan copay, option of new high-deductible health plan, improved alignment of dental
and vision plans between groups, and Retirees’ Health Trust contributions.
The PERS Safety rate includes both Police and Fire groups. For Fiscal Year 2011-12, the
Fire Safety group chose to amend the PERS contract to include their previous cost share
as part of the employee contribution, thus reducing the employer rate by the same
amount. Because both groups make up the Safety rate, the PERS rate is a blend of the
two groups.
Pension costs have increased dramatically since 2000; they were adopted at $2.9 million
(4.7 percent of GOF expenditures), but are $11.2 million (11.8 percent of GOF
expenditures) for Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted. Pension costs continue to grow and in
many cities the employer pays some or all of the employee contribution. Mountain
View employees not only pay the employee contribution, but they also pay a portion of
the employer contribution. Although this is becoming more common in other agencies
as they have grappled with budget deficits, this was an unusual and progressive
arrangement when instituted in Mountain View and reflects the collaborative approach
of our employees.
As a result of the significant financial losses to PERS and the resulting impacts to the
financial sustainability of the pension plans, many changes in the way PERS rates are
calculated have been adopted in the past several years as follows:
•

In March 2012, the PERS Board approved the reduction of 0.25 percent in the
discount rate used to calculate the pension liability and corresponding employer
contribution rates. The impact is 0.92 percent and 1.4 percent employer rate
increase for miscellaneous employees and a 2.56 percent and 1.6 percent employer
rate increase for safety employees for Fiscal Years 2013-14 and 2014-15,
respectively. For Mountain View, this resulted in an increase to pension costs of
$1.3 million (net of additional cost share) phased in over two years. These impacts
have been incorporated into the General Operating Fund Budget.

•

On April 17, 2013, the PERS Board adopted recommendations of the Chief
Actuary. The recommendations changed the methodology for the amortization
and smoothing of rates. Overall, the proposed methods are expected to result in
higher volatility in employer rates in normal years, but less volatility in employer
rates in years where extreme events occur (e.g., significant investment losses). The
method will result in increased higher employer rates over time, but are also
expected to result in improved funding levels.

3-54

Return to Previous

As the funding level of this liability has decreased during this past recession, the Fiscal
Year 2014-15 Adopted Budget includes a contribution of $1.0 million from the Fiscal
Year 2013-14 carryover towards the PERS unfunded liability.
FORECAST
The proposal to consolidate development activities into the Development Services Fund
transfers staffing costs from the GOF. The discussion below includes information
regarding COLAs and medical rates and comparisons of projected costs.
In accordance with the various MOUs and employee group agreements, a 2.0 percent
COLA is included in the projections for Fiscal Year 2014-15. Fiscal Year 2015-16
includes a modest projected COLA, but the remaining forecast years do not include
COLAs as this would result in projected deficits. All forecast years include step and
merit increases. The Forecast does not reflect the MVFF MOU two-year extension
adopted July 1, 2014.
Fiscal Year 2014-15 medical insurance rates are projected to increase 11.0 percent and
dental rates are anticipated to increase 3.0 percent. The following two fiscal years
assume medical rates will continue to increase by 11.0 percent and the remainder of the
forecast period assumes an annual 10.0 percent increase. Dental rates increase by 3.0
percent throughout the forecast period.
Overall, retirement costs are projected to increase 7.6 percent compared to the Fiscal
Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget. This incorporates the reduction resulting from the
consolidation of development-related activities. In Fiscal Years 2015-16 through 202021, the annual increases are projected to fluctuate between 6.0 percent and 14.4 percent.
All employee groups contribute their employee share of PERS costs plus a “cost share”
of a portion of the City’s contribution.
On February 18, 2014, the PERS Board adopted changes as a result of the demographic
study. The study resulted in increased rates as life expectancy continues to rise.
Generational mortality tables are also being incorporated in the actuarial assumptions.
However, previously PERS staff had anticipated recommending an additional 0.25
percent to 0.5 percent reduction in the discount rate, but no change was recommended
as the PERS Board did not adopt a change in the allocation of investments. The
demographic changes are anticipated to raise rates by 4.5 percent and 7.05 percent over
five years, for miscellaneous and public safety, respectively. This equates to
approximately $1.7 million for miscellaneous and $1.7 million for public safety annually
after the impact is fully phased in.

CAPITAL OUTLAY AND EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT

The Capital Outlay and Equipment Replacement category represents the new and
replacement equipment needs of the City. Although individually, Capital Outlay is
one-time in nature, the City includes this category in the Operating Budget to reflect
capital needs on an annual basis. In addition, annual contributions to the Equipment
Replacement Fund are made by the General Operating Fund, Building/Development
Services, Shoreline Golf Links, Parking District, Shoreline Regional Park Community,
Water, Wastewater, Solid Waste Management, and Fleet Maintenance Funds based on
the equipment used by each of those operations. Equipment replacement expenses are
accounted for in the Equipment Replacement Reserve Fund.

Equipment Replacement.

HISTORY
Capital Outlay: Since Fiscal Year 1993-94, the annual expenditures have grown as a
result of an increased level of technology and related equipment, an increase in the
number and quality of safety vehicles, and the addition of hybrid vehicles to the fleet.
This category is also impacted by the economic condition impacting the GOF and has
also experienced fluctuations over the past 10 fiscal years. For the past decade, annual
budgeted expenditures for Capital Outlay have ranged between $163,000 and $397,000
and averaged $259,000. For Fiscal Year 2013-14, capital outlay was funded at $310,000.
Equipment Replacement: The Equipment Replacement Reserve was funded with yearend General Fund carryover in Fiscal Years 1992-93 and 1993-94. Subsequently,
appropriations were gradually increased until the GOF was fully funding its share in
Fiscal Year 2001-02. Then, after several years of reduced contributions, a review of cost
methodologies, useful life assumptions, and annual contributions was completed in
Fiscal Year 2005-06, and staff concluded annual funding would need to be restored in
order to financially sustain the replacement schedule. This was accomplished through a
combination of increasing operating budget contributions supplemented by GOF
carryover. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2009-10, the full share of funding is budgeted in the
GOF. The Fiscal Year 2013-14 contribution to Equipment Replacement is adopted at
$2.2 million.

FORECAST
Capital Outlay: The Fiscal Year 2014-15 funding is adopted at $310,000 and the

Equipment Replacement: The Fiscal Year 2014-15 GOF contribution is projected to
increase 2.0 percent to $2.3 million and the remainder of the forecast period includes
average annual increases of 3.0 percent to continue full funding of the GOF’s share of
equipment replacement.

SELF-INSURANCE

The Self-Insurance category represents the General Operating Fund’s share of insurance
costs accounted for in the Internal Service Funds. Special Funds and the Enterprise
Funds also contribute to self-insurance.
CATEGORIES
•

General Liability.

•

Retirees’ Health Program.

•

Vision Care.

HISTORY
General Liability: In Fiscal Year 1993-94, the City joined a liability insurance pool
(ACCEL) with other select cities for the provision of coverage in excess of the $1.0
million self-insured retention (SIR). Beginning in Fiscal Year 2001-02, funding of
liability insurance was spread to all funds which receive a benefit from this insurance
coverage. Previously, the cost was funded entirely by the GOF.
Retirees’ Health Insurance Program: The medical premiums for eligible retirees are
paid by the Retirees’ Health Fund. Although the City was not yet required to fund this
liability, Council allocated funds to this reserve beginning in Fiscal Year 1992-93.
In 2004, the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) published Statement No.
45—Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits
Other Than Pensions—which required the City report the annual cost of this liability in
the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) beginning in Fiscal Year
2007-08. An actuarial report was completed and beginning in Fiscal Year 2006-07, the
calculated normal cost (NC) portion for current employees was budgeted in all the
affected funds. In addition, for Fiscal Year 2006-07, Council approved contributions
from other funds for their proportionate share of the unfunded actuarial accrued
liability (UAAL). An update of the actuarial valuation is prepared a minimum of every
two years and was last prepared as of July 1, 2013.
In February 2008, Council approved an agreement authorizing the City’s participation
in the PERS-administered California Employees Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT) Fund,
and in February 2009, the City began depositing funds into the CERBT. The balance in
the CERBT as of June 30, 2014 is $86.0 million.

Vision Care: Vision care claims for employees and retirees with Health Net medical
coverage and reimbursement for safety glasses submitted by current employees are
paid by the Employee Benefits Fund. The annual cost of this program is allocated to all
operating funds.
FORECAST
General Liability: The Fiscal Years 2014-15 through 2023-24 projections are based on
maintaining the minimum policy level for reserve balances. The City has a $1.0 million
self-insurance retention (SIR). For Fiscal Year 2014-15, the GOF is contributing $1.1
million, a 4.1 percent decrease resulting from the transfer of development-related
activities to the Development Services Fund. The remainder of the forecast period
includes 4.0 percent average annual increases.
Retirees’ Health Insurance Program: The Fiscal Year 2014-15 Adopted Budget includes
$1.9 million for the UAAL amortization and the additional $1.0 million contribution, for
a total of $2.9 million.
Between July 1, 2011 and July 1, 2013, the Actuarial Accrued Liability (AAL) increased
from $82.7 million to $101.9 million and is 84.4 percent funded as of June 30, 2014. A
significant component of the increase in the AAL is due to the reduction of the discount
rate from 7.61 percent to 7.0 percent. All funds except the GOF have or continue to fully
fund their share of the liability. The GOF continues to contribute its share of the
amortization of the unfunded liability. As this is the first opportunity to contribute
funds towards this liability since prior to the recession, Council adopted staff’s proposal
to contribute $1.0 million from the Fiscal Year 2013-14 carryover, and $1.0 million in the
budget for each of the following two fiscal years, Fiscal Year 2014-15 and Fiscal Year
2015-16, to raise the funding status of this liability.
Using the projections from the July 2013 valuation, the UAAL amortization declines
through Fiscal Year 2017-18 (the end of the valuation projections) and the remaining
forecast years remain at the same level. The difference between the pay-as-you-go
premiums and the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) will be deposited into the
CERBT on an annual basis. The actuarial will be updated next as of July 1, 2015.
Vision Care: The GOF’s contribution is based on the projected amount required to fund
vision coverage for employees and retirees with Health Net coverage and safety glasses
for employees.

Performance/Workload Measure tied to it, it is noted in parenthesis with an
“M” and the Performance/ Workload Measure number(s) following (e.g. M 1,
2, 3). Please note that Departmental Functions are long-term goals and

positions are calculated using the minimum/maximum range of the
position classification. In general, hourly positions are budgeted at the
higher end of the range; seasonal hourly positions are generally budgeted
at mid-range.

Provides increased funding in the Council’s budget as recommended by the CPC
on April 8, 2014. The travel and training budget was reduced as part of the budget
balancing during this past recession while travel and training costs continue to rise.

recommended an increase in the reserve to make funds available, as needed, as
determined by the Mayor.

General Non-Operating Fund:
Newly Elected Council Per-Term Allowance (limited-period):

$11,400

Per Council Policy A-2, each Councilmember is to receive an allowance of $3,800
per term for specialized office equipment necessary to allow Councilmembers to
perform their official duties and communicate with the public and staff.
Council Team Building (limited-period):

$2,500

Provides funding for Council team building. With the 2014 election and three new
members joining the Council, the CPC recommended funds for a Council team
building in early 2015.

FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES—ADMINISTRATION
PROGRAM SUMMARY

PROGRAM MANAGER—FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE
SERVICES DIRECTOR
PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Administration is responsible for the management of the Finance and Administrative Services
Department. This division provides leadership, policy development, administrative and technical
support, career development, and training opportunities.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•

General Operating Fund:
Mountain View Police Activities League (MVPAL):

$5,000

Provides funding for MVPAL. MVPAL is, primarily, a youth crime prevention
program that relies on educational, athletic, and other recreational activities to
cement a bond between Police Officers and youth. Studies have shown that if a
young person respects a Police Officer on the ball field or in the classroom, the
youth is more likely to respect the laws that Police Officers enforce. Such respect is
beneficial to the youth, the Police Officer, the neighborhood, and the business
community.
This budgeted amount will support the various MVPAL
programming such as boxing, soccer, tennis, and other programming.
Council Procedures Committee (CPC) Recommendation:

$1,000

Provides increased funding as recommended by the CPC on April 18, 2014 for
membership to the Mayor’s Innovation Project.
•

General Non-Operating Fund:
Housing Trust Boomerang Funds (limited-period):

$191,800

The Cities Association of Santa Clara County, Housing Trust Silicon Valley, and
Silicon Valley Leadership Group have joined together to support regional efforts to
increase funding for affordable housing in our communities. As a result of the
dissolution of redevelopment agencies (RDAs) and the loss of the previous 20.0
percent housing set aside for low- and moderate-income housing funds, the
proposal identifies two potential streams of revenue: (1) the one-time funds that
were unencumbered; and (2) the ongoing funds that are distributed to cities
previously directed to RDAs. These have been deemed “boomerang” funds. This
provides funding for the one-time unencumbered funds ($140,800) and 20.0 percent
of the net ongoing funds ($51,000), to be reviewed annually.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT—PLANNING
PROGRAM SUMMARY

PROGRAM MANAGER—ASSISTANT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
DIRECTOR/PLANNING MANAGER
PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Planning participates in long-range local and regional planning activities and is responsible for all
matters concerning the implementation of the Zoning Ordinance, including the issuance of use permits,
variance requests, and planned-unit development permits. This division assembles community data;
develops and maintains the City’s General Plan, precise plans, and Zoning Ordinance; reviews and
administers zone change proposals; provides primary staffing to the EPC; reviews private development
projects for design and compliance with the Zoning Ordinance; is responsible for CEQA review and
subdivision design; and provides information to the public on regulations, zoning codes, and
development projects. This division provides information for private-sector businesses, investors, and
developers considering locations in Mountain View, and participates in early discussions with people
considering new development or uses in the City. The division also holds hearings on proposed projects
through the Development Review Committee and the Zoning Administrator.

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•

General Non-Operating Fund:
Housing Element Update (rebudget balance):

$144,300

ongoing high level of development activity as well as provide enhanced support at

Associate Planner Position (limited-period):

$143,600

position in past fiscal years, resources for counter coverage have been reduced to
minimal levels, creating difficulty in providing excellent service to customers. This
position improves customer service at the counter, increases the number of overthe-counter “One Stop” permits that can be issued, and potentially increases the
counter hours.
Office Assistant I/II Position (limited-period):

$95,300

Continuation of funding for an Office Assistant I/II position. This position was
eliminated in Fiscal Year 2003-04 as part of a budget reduction strategy. Given the

MAJOR PROGRAM CHANGES
•

General Non-Operating Fund:
Mobility Coordinator Position (limited-period):

$150,000

Provides funding for a new Mobility Coordinator position. This is intended to be a
two-year, limited-period position to focus on furthering the Council goal to
"Improve Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility.” This new position will provide
expertise in developing policies, guidelines, and projects; support the B/PAC; and
provide input on private development projects. It will also free up some staff
resources in Traffic Engineering and Transportation to focus on other priorities. A
portion ($50,000) of the annual funding is funded from the recently provided
Google Bike & Pedestrian grant.
Wind Down of Energy Upgrade Mountain View (limited-period):

$35,000

Provides funding for a six-month extension of the program through December 31,
2014. The goal is to sign up 200 new program participants and an additional
reduction of 168,000 pounds of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This program
was originally funded by a Federal grant to December 31, 2012, and extended
through Fiscal Year 2013-14 with limited-period funding.

PUBLIC WORKS—TRANSPORTATION AND BUSINESS SERVICES
PROGRAM SUMMARY

Community Choice Aggregation (limited-period):

$30,000

A presentation about the possible formation of a CCA District by Santa Clara
County cities was made at the March 2014 Cities Association Board meeting.
California State law allows cities and counties to pool their residential, business,
and municipal electricity loads and to purchase and/or generate power on their
behalf through the formation of a Joint Powers Agreement (JPA), special district, or
CCA. Energy transmission, distribution, repair, and customer service functions
remain with the local utility.
Undertaking a CCA feasibility study, at a projected cost of $60,000 to be shared by
interested jurisdictions, has been briefly discussed by agency representatives. The
cost per agency would depend on the number of participants. This provides
placeholder funding, not to exceed $30,000, for the City to participate in the
feasibility study.
Environmental Sustainability Program (rebudget balance):

$16,300

Rebudgets the balance available for materials, supplies, and services for the
Environmental Sustainability Program.
2012 Community-Wide Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory (limited-period):

$15,000

Provides funding to conduct an inventory of 2012 community-wide GHG
emissions in order to measure against GHG reduction targets approved by Council
in 2009.
•

Solid Waste Fund:
Recology Diversion Incentive Program:

$100,000

The new collection services agreement with Recology provides for a diversion
incentive whereby Recology is eligible for a financial incentive payment if it attains
certain diversion targets. The maximum payment per year is $100,000, but may be
less in any given year.
Residential Food Waste Pilot Program (limited-period):

$60,500

Provides funding to implement a pilot program to collect food waste from
residential customers. The other SMaRT partners are currently (Palo Alto) or will
be (Sunnyvale) running a residential food waste pilot program. Each partner
agreed to implement a different pilot and share the results. This will allow
Mountain View to choose from several different options if a full-scale program is
desired.

The Parking District (District) is a maintenance assessment district in the downtown Castro Street area created to
provide and maintain parking lots and structures. In addition to property taxes, an annual assessment is levied
on properties in the District. The Mountain View City Code requires that as a condition of approval for any
development within the District, the developer or owner shall provide the required off-street parking, pay the
parking in-lieu fee or a combination of both. These funds are restricted for the construction of new parking
spaces and are accounted for in the Reserve for Future Parking.
The Business Improvement Districts (BID) were created for specific areas of the downtown and are an
assessment to the business owners based on the type and size of the business. These funds are utilized for
staffing dedicated to the promotion and support of downtown businesses.

The City implemented a self-insurance program for Workers' Compensation benefits on September 7, 1975 as
authorized by Council Resolution No. 10581. This program provides for State mandated insurance benefits
(salary and medical costs) for employees who are injured on the job.
Financially, this fund is composed of resources for current operating expenditures, future costs of previously
incurred injury claims and reserves for catastrophic losses. This fund also provides for the administration of
safety and loss prevention programs throughout the City to reduce the probability of incurring future
catastrophic claims against the City.
* The increase in the actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2013 has caused the ending balance to be negative.
This was reviewed and the Fiscal Year 2013-14 Adopted Budget includes transfers of $1.8 million from the
General Non-Operating Fund and $187,000 from Other Funds. The Fiscal Year 2014-15 Adopted Budget
includes transfers of $500,000 from the Liability Insurance Fund and $300,000 from the General Non-Operating
Fund to bring the balance to policy level. The valuation completed as of June 30, 2014 further increases the
liability and the balance will need to be supplemented to bring it to policy level.

On August 11, 1980, Council approved a self-insurance program for liability insurance effective
September 1, 1980. Existing provisions include claims approval authority to $30,000. Any claims
exceeding $30,000 require City Council approval.
The City acts as its own agent and controls risk to limit liability loss exposure. There is a $1.0 million selfinsurance retention for each liability incident. The minimum reserve and balance for future claims of $2.0
million is maintained in accordance with Council policy. Other insurance such as property, flood, earthquake
and other coverages are not self-insured and the City purchases insurance policies.

This fund was established in Fiscal Year 1985-86 as a self-insurance fund to pay the health insurance premiums
of employees retired from the City. Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued Statement
No. 45, which requires an actuarial valuation be performed bi-ennially to calculate the City's other post
employment benefits (OPEB) liabilities. The City implemented GASB Statement No. 45 in Fiscal Year 2007-08
and has chosen to budget the Annual Required Contribution (ARC). The reserve is supplemented as funds
become available.
On February 26, 2008 Council approved joining the California Employers Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT),
managed by the California Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) and the City began transferring funds
in Fiscal Year 2008-09. As of June 30, 2010 the City had transferred all accumulated reserves to the CERBT
and at a minimum will continue to annually transfer the ARC less Retirees' Health premiums.

Governmental fund balances are no longer classified as reserved or unreserved. A new reporting hierarchy is
established by GASB Statement No. 54 (Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions) that is
based on the extent to which the City is bound to honor constraints on the specific purpose for which amounts in a
fund can be spent.
• Restricted - Constraints on expenditures are externally imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws/regulations of
other

legislation.
• Committed - Formal action by the City Council (Council) places the constraint on how the funds can be spent
and may only be altered by the same type of Council action. Contractual obligations are included in this category.
• Assigned - The City's intent to use funds for a specific purpose as expressed by Council or a delegated authority.
• Unassigned - This is the residual classification for the General Fund.
Appropriations for Compensated Absences Reserve are on an as needed basis up to the amount of the balance.
Comprised of a $5.0 million reserve policy balance plus a $3.3 million prepaid lease for the Downtown Family
Housing project.
Includes $5.0 million to fund the Rengstorff Park Community Center Construction project in Fiscal Year 2017-18.
Up to $1.0 million to be used for the First Time Homebuyers Program.

FISCAL YEAR 2014-15
ADOPTED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

The emphasis for the Fiscal Year 2014-15 Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is on the:
• Review, refinement and funding of Fiscal Year 2014-15 projects identified in the
Five-Year Capital Plan adopted by the City Council last June.
• Identification and funding of additional new projects for Fiscal Year 2014-15
given anticipated financial and staffing resources, that support City Council
goals and priorities, address health and safety concerns, and/or are needed to
comply with regulatory requirements.
The CIP is funded from a variety of sources. Some funding sources, such as the CIP
Reserve and Construction/Conveyance Tax (C/C Tax) Funds, have no restrictions on
their use. Other CIP funding sources must be used for specific purposes (e.g., Water
Fund—water system infrastructure and maintenance; Wastewater Fund—sewer system
infrastructure and maintenance; Shoreline Community Fund—projects that facilitate
development in the City's North Bayshore Area and/or support Shoreline Regional
Park operations; Gas Tax Fund—design and construction of roadway improvements,
etc.).
While there are no limitations on how CIP Reserve and C/C Tax funds can be used for
CIP-related purposes, the amount of money available in these unrestricted funds for
capital projects is limited over the CIP planning cycle. In preparing the Fiscal Year
2014-15 Adopted CIP staff assumed the estimate of $1.4 million in General Fund
carryover funding available to allocate to the CIP Reserve, as well as a $350,000
reimbursement from the Development Services Fund.
The Fiscal Year 2014-15 CIP is balanced and maintains all fund reserves as required by
Council policy. There is an estimated total of $58,000 of increased annual future
operating costs associated with the Fayette Area Park ($26,000), the 771 Rengstorff
Avenue Park ($24,000), the Permanente Creek Trail - Amphitheatre Parkway Crossing
($5,000), and the Sailing Lake Access Road ($3,000).
A list of all of the projects included in the Fiscal Year 2014-15 Adopted CIP and major
funding sources follows as listed below:
• Non-Discretionary
• Discretionary
• Amendments to Existing Projects

Legal Debt Margin:
The legal debt margin for the City of Mountain View, California, is calculated using a debt
limit of 15 percent of the assessed value of property (excluding tax increment) within the City
limits. Computation of the City's legal debt margin as of June 30, 2013 is as follows (dollars in
thousands):
Assessed value (net)—June 30, 2013(1)

Legal debt margin

$ 2,601,716

In 2001 the City was awarded a AAA issuer credit rating by Standard and Poor’s (S & P), one
of the nation’s top-ranked independent credit rating agencies. S & P upgraded the City from
AA to AAA, the highest credit rating possible, because of a solid and diversified local tax base,
the City’s low debt burden, high property values and personal income levels and the
expectation of continued strong financial operations by the City. At that time, Mountain View
was one of only three California cities to receive the AAA rating from S & P. The AAA issuer
credit rating was last reaffirmed by S & P in 2012 and has resulted in lower debt costs and
savings to the City.
Debt Obligations Outstanding:
As of June 30, 2014, the City is anticipated to have various debt obligations outstanding. These
obligations are comprised of the following (dollars in thousands):
City of Mountain View:
The City of Mountain View's 2001 Refunding Certificates of Participation (COPs) debt was
issued to refinance and call bonds on the City lease component of the 1992 Capital
Improvement Financing Authority Revenue Bonds.
Water Revenue Bonds were issued in 2004 to fund the construction of infrastructure to expand
the City's water storage capacity.

CALCULATION OF APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

The City is required by the State Constitution, Article XIIIB, to annually calculate the
maximum amount of appropriations subject to limitation. This calculation is intended
to limit the annual growth in tax revenues used to fund governmental expenditures in
California. Article XIIIB was changed with the passage of Proposition 111 on the
June 1990 ballot. These changes permit greater flexibility with regard to annually
calculating increases in the appropriations limit by allowing additional growth factors
to be used. The factors permitting the maximum allowable increase in the appropriations limit are chosen for the calculation each fiscal year.
As can be seen below, the City is substantially under its appropriations limit. The
difference between the appropriations limit and the appropriations subject to limitation
has grown over time as the limit has been substantially increased by the annual
adjustment factors. This, combined with the comparatively slower pace of growth in
proceeds of taxes over the same time period, has contributed to the amount under the
appropriations limit.

SUMMARY OF
FINANCIAL AND BUDGETARY POLICIES
The City Council has established financial and budgetary policies which are reviewed
and updated as necessary by approval of the City Council. A comprehensive and
consistent set of financial and budgetary policies provides a basis for sound financial
planning, identifies appropriate directions for service-level development, aids
budgetary decision-making and serves as an overall framework to guide financial
management and operations of the City.
A city’s adoption of financial policies also promotes public confidence and increases the
city’s credibility in the eyes of bond rating agencies and potential investors. Such
policies also provide the resources to react to potential financial emergencies in a
prudent manner. The adopted Financial and Budgetary Policy can be found at the link
below and a summary of this policy is included in this document.
http://laserfiche.mountainview.gov/WebLink/0/doc/66661/Page1.aspx
Budget Policies:
All governmental fund-type annual budgets are presented on a modified accrual basis
consistent with the general purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Pursuant to Council-adopted financial and
budgetary policies, budgets are approved at the fund and department level (legal level
of control) and may not be exceeded without City Council approval. Transfers and
adjustments between funds, departments and capital projects must be submitted to the
City Council for approval. The City Charter requires approval by five votes of the
seven-member City Council to amend the budget.
Budget Adjustments:
Budget adjustments are also required for grants and reimbursed services that were not
anticipated or budgeted. Council Policy A-10 “Authorization to Execute City Contracts
and Agreements and Increase Certain Limited Appropriations” authorizes the Finance
and Administrative Services Director and the City Manager to increase appropriations
up to $20,000 and $100,000 (indexed to 2011 dollars), respectively, when outside grants

accounting. Revenues are recorded as received or accrued if they are both measurable
and available to finance expenditures of the current period. Expenditures are recorded
when the related fund liability is incurred, except for principal and interest on longterm debt, which are recorded when paid.
Proprietary fund types are accounted for using the accrual basis of accounting wherein
revenues, unbilled or billed, are recognized in the accounting period in which they are
earned, and expenses are recognized in the period liabilities are incurred. For budgetary purposes, capital projects are appropriated for the estimated cost of the total project.
These financial uses of funds are not reflected as expenses in the City's financial
statements but are capitalized and depreciated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Cost Allocation Plan:
The City prepares a cost allocation plan, to identify the costs associated with providing
certain services. These indirect charges, noted as General Fund Administration on the

Accounts Payable and Information Technology. The full cost allocation plan delineates
the basis of allocation by department which may include the total operating budget, the
number of full-time equivalent positions per department, the number of work requests,
square footage occupied, number of items processed, number of applicable devices, etc.

Risk Management Policies:
- The City will maintain an appropriate level of funding or insurance coverage for
exposure to risks of financial loss through self-insurance, partial self-insurance,
commercial insurance, or pooled insurance with other agencies, whichever form is the
most cost effective in the long term. If self-insuring, stop loss insurance or pooled
insurance should be acquired in order to minimize the amount of self-insured retention,

Taxes—Compulsory charges levied by a government for the purpose of financing
services performed for the common benefit.
Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL)—The portion of the AAL that does not
have funds set aside toward this liability. Used in reference to the PERS system and
Retirees' Health Insurance Program.
Unsecured Debt—Obligation not backed by the pledge of specific collateral.
Utilities—A public service such as gas, electricity or water. Also used to account for
expenditures for services such as gas, electricity, water, refuse collection, etc. (account
classification 55300s).
Utility Funds—See Enterprise Funds.
Utility Rolls—Utility property assessed by the State Board of Equalization.
Vehicle License Fee (VLF)—Established in 1953 as a uniform statewide tax, the VLF is a
tax on the ownership of a registered vehicle in place of taxing vehicles as personal
property. By law, all revenues from the VLF fund city and county services, but the state
legislature controls the tax rate and the allocation among local governments. In 2004,
the Legislature permanently reduced the VLF tax rate and eliminated state general fund
backfill to cities and counties. Instead, cities and counties now receive additional
transfers of property tax revenues in lieu of VLF. In 2011 the legislature eliminated all
VLF allocations to local agencies in order to fund COP’s grant, booking fee subvention
and other safety related grants.
VTA—Valley Transportation Authority.
