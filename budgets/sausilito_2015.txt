INVESTING IN THE QUALITY OF SAUSALITO’S FUTURE

CITY OF SAUSALITO

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

SUMMARY
This document is the City’s Strategic Resource Allocation Plan and includes two years of operating and capital budgets, and six years of capital improvement planning. The
proposed 2014-16 operating and capital budgets and 2014-2020 capital improvement plan (CIP) strikes a balance between the need for fiscal restraint and the need to support a
bold vision for the future.
As the accompanying chart indicates, the “back-tothe-basics” city management approach during the
Great Recession, created budget opportunities for
the City of Sausalito to continue operations without
sacrificing the excellent customers service that
residents have come to expect.
The subsequent “building-on-the-basics” city
management approach focused on structurally
rebalancing City resources with operations in order
to be financially positioned to provide for “status
quo” levels of service. Particularly noteworthy are
the pension reforms enacted by the City Council
that created substantial budget savings; and the
pension reforms continue to manifest surplus
savings due to the accelerating attrition of the City’s
senior, tenured workforce.
The proposed 2014-16 operating and capital budget
is balanced by these reforms while projecting
modest growth in revenues and proposing spending
that reflects a slowly rebounding local economy,
In the most recent citizen survey Sausalito residents
continue to express a very high degree of satisfaction
about the value of services they receive for their tax
dollars, the overall quality of city services, and the
overall quality of life in Sausalito.

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

On the horizon, there are significant infrastructure challenges – particularly for storm water and storm drain maintenance and infrastructure; accelerated streets improvements
and creating accessible sidewalks for our age-friendly and physically challenged community.
FY 2014-15 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS
The adopted operating budget provides a blueprint to continue providing quality services; the city’s capital investment plan sets forth a strategy for ongoing progress in meeting
the city’s long-term infrastructure needs. Highlights include:


Operating Budget:






Rebounding economy generating increasing tax revenues – both elastic and
inelastic
Labor cost reforms generating significant savings of annual pension and
retiree health benefit costs
Continuation of excellent city services: public safety, library, recreation,
beautification, maintenance services
Maintaining city reserve funds
Adjusts sewer utility rates to keep pace with environmental projects that
protect Richardson Bay and citizens from health hazards

NEW BUDGET FORMAT
The City has historically published a traditional line-item budget. Although easy to
use and understandable, line-item budgets focus attention on thought on how many
dollars are being spent on services or goods. Although that approach is important,
and still necessary as basic budget building, contemporary governmental budgeting
wants to present budget documents so that policy makers concentrate on decisions

MLK capital purchase and capital improvements leases retired

Capital Improvement Plan:





Continuing street improvements including a concrete street reconstruction
Increased funding for small parks improvements
Projected ferry terminal shoreside improvements from grant resources
Employs strategic use of long-term financing to accelerate sewer
infrastructure projects

about levels of service, and how community priorities are being addressed. Through
the use of department and programmatic descriptions, listing of duties, and
presentation of certain performance indicators, this budget document shifts
attention from the means of accomplishment to the accomplishment itself.

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

CITY MANAGER MESSAGE
10 June, 2014
To the Honorable Mayor and City Council
OPENING REMARKS
In accordance with my responsibility as City Manager, I am submitting the City of
Sausalito’s proposed FY2014-16 two-year Resource Allocation Plan that contains
the proposed FY 2014-15 City Operating and Capital budgets for all funds (less
transfers between funds) recommended at $30,909,630. The FY 2014-15 City
Budget for the General Fund is recommended at $12,910,130.
The proposed budget meets the policy directives of the City Council and complies
with state law. The proposed budget meets all requirements of the city’s various
outstanding debt. The budget also provides monies for the approved union contracts
and complies with state law requirements for funding those contracts. Reserve funds
are maintained as Council directed. The budget provides for a continuation of the
excellent City services that Sausalito citizens have received in the previous year.
CITY COUNCIL PRIORITIES
Biannually, staff presents to the City Council, through the City Council Finance
Committee, a comprehensive resource allocation plan that includes a two year
operating and a two year capital budget that is a component of the longer multi-year
capital improvement plan also included in the resource allocation plan. The
proposed budget was thoroughly vetted to ensure it is consistent with the Budget
Policies of the City Council. The City Council Finance Committee reviewed each
department and every fund during multiple meetings in April and May. The
proposed FY 2014-15 budget reflects the City’s management policy of “Building on
the Basics”, and further reflects staff’s approach to thinking creatively in applying
“What If? Why Not?” methodologies. The proposed budget addresses items on the

City Council’s Priority Calendar, and the goals and objectives of the City Council’s
Strategic Plan.
The two-year operating and capital budget is balanced and reflects the same highquality, resident-serving level of service that the City has historically delivered.
Consistent with the City’s long-term fiscal modelling and strategic planning
conclusions, the City’s operating budget continues to be structurally balanced.
COMMUNITY SURVEY
Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates (FM3) recently completed a survey
to assess community attitudes toward local issues facing the City of Sausalito,
including awareness of City budget issues, satisfaction with City services,
community budget priorities and interest in community enacted funding to
address local needs. From April 6–May 4, 2013, FM3 completed 200 telephone
interviews with City of Sausalito voters. Opinions were gathered from young and
old, single-family and multi-family home. The overall results can be projected
across the whole city. Where applicable, results are compared to a prior survey of
Sausalito voters conducted on behalf of the City in 2011. The survey results
indicate that:




The community is highly supportive of the overall direction of the City.
Two-thirds of respondents continue to feel the city is headed in the right
direction.
More than three-quarters of respondents say they approve of the job
being done by the City in providing basic services and taking care of the
needs of Sausalito residents
70% of the citizens knowledgeable about City finances have confidence
in the City’s fiscal management.

There is broad agreement that the City should focus on maintaining the City’s
long-term financial viability, with 92 percent of respondents identifying this as an

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

important priority. Constituents also identified a range of other specific services as
particularly important, including the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Maintaining storm drains to prevent pollutants, garbage and sediment
from entering the Bay (92%)
Repairing 80-year old deteriorating storm drains (91%)
Fixing potholes (95%)
Maintaining and repairing neighborhood streets (94%)
Fixing broken and potentially unsafe sidewalks (91%)

STAFFING AND PERSONNEL
The proposed FY 2014-15 budget authorizes staffing at 70 Full Time Employees
plus 2 contract positions of City Attorney and Administrative Services Director /
Treasurer
The FY 2014-15 salary range tables reflect a 1% Cost Of Living Allowance (COLA)
for SEIU employees, and 1.25% increase for Police Officers consistent with the
negotiated labor agreements. The City has a resolution memorializing the past
practice of linking Managers and Confidential Employees with SEIU contracts and
the tables also reflect that policy and past practice.
The FY 2015-16 budget includes an estimate of 1.5% COLA for all employees
although FY 2015-16 employment agreements with all labor groups are not
negotiated. Negotiations will commence in January of 2015.
LEVELS OF SERVICE
The City Council of the City of Sausalito adopts an annual budget to carry on the
various department, divisions, and programs of the municipality and to provide for
the payment of bonded indebtedness of the City each fiscal year, and to control the
use of public monies. This year’s budget attempts to quantify the level of service in
each operating department through the inclusion of certain performance indicators.
In addition, each of the special revenue funds, capital improvement fund, enterprise

FY 2014 – 2016

funds, debt service funds and internal services funds include a description of purpose
and an explanation of the sources and uses of resources.
CAPITAL PROJECTS
The City has invested over $30 million in infrastructure during the past six fiscal
years. New public safety facilities were constructed, the Sausalito bulkhead was
reconstructed, over 70% of City streets were paved – including concrete streets, old
and deteriorating sewer pipes were replaced, Vina del Mar park was rehabilitated,
a new downtown public restroom was built, to name but a few of the aggressive
capital projects that the City invested in. This “Economic Stimulus” jump-started
Sausalito’s local economy as construction workers consumed local domestic
product. Newly generated local jobs were produced as a result Sausalito’s capital
investment. Millions of dollars in new private sector business revenue was
generated, and provided hundreds of thousands of new state and local taxes. This
substantial investment in infrastructure will provide Sausalito residents and
businesses with significant levels of improved services, the enhanced capability to
absorb increasing capacity, and future reduced maintenance costs.
This Resource Allocation Plan includes a new six-year Capital Improvement
Program (CIP). The first two years of the CIP becomes the City’s two year capital
budget. The first two years of the capital budget are balanced against critical capital
projects. However, there are serious concerns regarding the future funding of the
City’s infrastructure needs. Eight-year old, deteriorated storm drains need replacing,
more streets need annual repairing than are currently programmed, more potholes
need to be filled, and sidewalks must be made accessible for children, elderly and
people with disabilities. In order to continue to maintain the long-term financial
viability of the City, additional funding is needed to address these urgent
infrastructure and service needs. Staff and the Finance Committee are developing
strategies to ensure the City has a guaranteed source of local funding that will
provide additional resources to address our critical infrastructure needs in the most
fiscally responsible way possible.

LOOKING FORWARD / FINAL THOUGHTS
The enthusiasm and involvement of citizens, City Council Members, and
employees in City activities gives Sausalito much to look forward to. The proposed
budget includes an ambitious and worthy agenda driven by everyone’s desire to
excel in all areas. The City of Sausalito continues to manage its fiduciary
responsibility by being fiscally responsible, delivering consistent high quality level
of municipal services, maintaining a structurally balanced budget, engaging in
meaningful pension reform, building solid reserves and providing funds for
infrastructure that stimulates the local economy. We are optimistic that residents,
businesses, the City Council, and staff will harness the energy that this allocation of
resources provides and will make Sausalito a better place to live and work.

FY 2014 – 2016

acknowledgement goes to the Executive Leadership Team. They have worked more
closely as ever as a team through an especially challenging task. Their countless
hours of analysis and creative thought reflect the cost savings and budget reduction
strategies in this budget that continue the City’s levels-of-service at the same levels
of funding as in previous fiscal years.
The fiscal health of the city could not have been achieved if it weren’t for the
foresight of the City Council. Thank you for your strength in laying the foundations
for a fiscally sustainable 2nd decade future in the 21st century.
Respectfully submitted,

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
A special ‘thank you’ goes to the entire City staff team involved in preparing the
proposed FY2014-16 two-year Resource Allocation Plan. Special

BUDGETS AND BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING
The City operates under the general law of the State of California, and annually
adopts a budget to be effective July 1 for the ensuing fiscal year. The City Manager
submits a Preliminary Budget to the City Council on or about June 1 each year.
This Preliminary Budget is the fiscal plan for the ensuing twelve months starting
July 1, and includes proposals for expenditures for operations and capital
improvement, and the resources to meet them. City Council conducts public
hearings at Council Chambers before adopting the budget. The Council approves
total appropriations at the department level in the General Fund, and at the fund
level in other funds. The Budget is adopted by City resolution prior to June 30.
The City Manager is authorized to transfer budget appropriations within
departments in conformance with the adopted policies set by the City Council. All
other transfers must be approved by the City Council. Any revisions that alter the
total expenditures of any department must be approved by the City Council.
Expenditures are budgeted at, and may not legally exceed, the department level for
the General Fund and the fund level for Special Revenue, Capital Projects and
AUDITS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
State law requires that every general-purpose government publish within six months
of the close of each fiscal year a complete set of audited financial statements.
Accordingly, the City prepares a comprehensive annual financial reports in
accordance with standards prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board (GASB), the Government Finance Officer Association of the United States
and Canada (GFOA) and other rule-making bodies.
The City prepares financial reports to promote accountability. The City’s elected
officials are accountable to the citizens; City management is accountable to the
elected officials. The comprehensive annual financial report gives citizens and other
interested parties one means of assessing whether the elected and appointed officials

Internal Service Funds. Budgeted amounts shown are as originally adopted, or as
amended by the City Council during the year.
Budgets for General Fund, all Debt Service Funds, all Enterprise Funds and certain
Special Revenue Funds are adopted on a basis consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). Except for Capital Project Funds, appropriations
lapse at fiscal year-end and are re-budgeted for the coming year. Capital Project
Funds are budgeted on a project length basis.
The budget of the City of Sausalito is a reflection of the City policies, goals, and
priorities. It communicates to citizens and staff what resource allocation decisions
have been made, including those involving staffing, technology, equipment, and
department priorities. It also serves to communicate to citizens and staff an action
plan for the upcoming two fiscal years, including departmental goals and the
standards by which the delivery of services to the public will be measured.

in the City have faithfully carried out their role of being good stewards of the City’s
resources.
In order to enhance the degree of confidence of intended users of the financial
statements, The City provides for an annual financial audit. The purpose of the audit
is to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are presented fairly,
in all material respects, and/or give a true and fair view in accordance with the
financial reporting framework. Maze & Associates, Certified Public Accountants,
have issued an unqualified (“clean”) opinion on the City of Sausalito’s financial
statements for the years ended June 30, 2006-2013.

COMMUNITY PROFILE
Nestled up against the Marin County end of the Golden Gate Bridge, Sausalito is a whimsical waterfront town that defies description. Once home to artists, writers, actors and
poets, Sausalito retains a pleasantly offbeat character with an upscale attitude. Stunning views, art galleries, funky boutiques and open-air restaurants make Sausalito a favored
tourist destination. Those same stunning views, a delightful climate, and an interesting selection of real estate make Sausalito a desirable place to live as well.
Sausalito is conveniently located for commuting to San Francisco. Only minutes from the Golden Gate Bridge, it is a relatively easy drive into the city. For those preferring
not to drive, Sausalito also is a ferry terminus for the Golden Gate Ferry, offering quick, inexpensive transportation into the city.
As a center of activity, Sausalito offers a wide variety of things to
do. The City’s 7,175 residents and over 450,000 annual tourists
stroll along the waterfront or hike the City’s hidden stairs and
trails, visit the Bay Model Visitor Center or take the Sausalito
Wooden Boat Tour – there is, indeed, something for everyone;
there are 78 acres in the City’s 19 parks, 3 City beaches, 9 tennis
courts, 3 basketball courts, baseball/softball diamonds and 1
soccer/football field. Every Labor Day weekend Sausalito hosts
what is considered to be one of the finest outdoor art festivals in
the country. In December, residents and visitors alike are treated
to the Lighted Yacht Parade. Then there is the tantalizing peek
into some of Sausalito’s most fascinating real estate with the
annual Sausalito Floating Homes Tour.
The City of Sausalito experiences geo-economic benefits from: its
unique residential community blended with “charm” to its commercial and industrial sectors; and world-class scenic tourist base. This yields a more stable tax and revenue
base than other California cities experiencing severe economic stress, structural imbalances, and non-sustainable budget policies. Sausalito’s economic decline during the recent
recession was mild and lagged the state and the nation. In a similar fashion, Sausalito’s current recovery will respectively be moderate. Sausalito’s elastic revenues (sales tax
and transient occupancy tax) are continuing its modest recovery and may be a leading indicator of an improving gross city product.
Sausalito's economy is very strong, with a projected per capita effective buying income of over 350% of the U.S., with equally exceptionally high owner-occupied housing
values. The city has access to the broad and diverse economy of the San Francisco bay area, and the county's 2012 unemployment rate of 6.3% was well below the national and
state levels. Property taxes remain a stable source of revenue. Other City taxes, such sales and transient occupancy taxes are more elastic and dependent on the national, state
and local economies.

COMMUNITY SURVEY
During the Mid-Year Budget review at the February 25, 2014 City Council Meeting, staff summarized its use of long-term fiscal models and the conclusions reached by the
City Council during their strategic plan session on November 22, 2013: Namely that the:




City’s current levels of service are adequately funded (stable);
Budget is structurally balanced and sound (sustainable); and
Reserve balances are sufficiently funded based on a risk analysis and mitigation strategy (resilient).

However the long-term fiscal models also demonstrated that in order to maintain the long-term financial viability of the City future additional resources are needed to
accommodate significant infrastructure investment. Key infrastructure needs include fixing the City’s 80-year-old storm drains to prevent pollutants, garbage and sediment from
entering the bay; maintaining and repairing neighborhood streets; and fixing broken and potentially unsafe sidewalks. The City does not currently have funds to address these
unfunded infrastructure and service needs.
Therefore, staff further recommended during the Mid-Year Budget Review that the City Council direct staff to proceed with a community survey for the following purposes:





To improve performance by better understanding what the public wants and expects from its government;
To understand community attitudes about a variety of service needs and ensure services and service levels reflect citizens’ priorities;
To understand public priorities in planning, budgeting, and managing services, including their interest in additional revenue generation opportunities; and,
To establish long term strategies to provide for a fiscally sustainable future for the jurisdiction.

Constituents express confidence in the overall direction in which the City is heading, and provide
highly positive assessments of the City’s job performance in key areas. Consistent with prior
assessments of the City’s overall direction, 64 percent of Sausalito constituents believe the City is
headed in the “right direction.” In contrast, only 17 percent say the City has “gotten off on the wrong
track,” while 19 percent indicate that they do not have enough information to offer an opinion.
Assessments of the City’s overall job performance are also strong. More than three-quarters (77%)
of respondents say they approve of the job being done by the City in providing basic services and
taking care of the needs of Sausalito residents, this includes 25% who strongly approve. Only 17
percent say they disapprove. Likewise, overwhelming majorities (85% or more) say they have a
favorable opinion of key City departments, including the library (93%), the Police Department (88%)
and the Parks and Recreation Department (87%).

CITY OF SAUSALITO

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

In addition, by a margin of nearly two to one, a majority of constituents (56%) say they “approve” of
the job being done by the City in managing local tax dollars. In contrast, less than one-quarter (23%)
say they “disapprove.” Notably, a comparable number (22%) say they do not have enough
information to offer an opinion.
Sausalito constituents place a high value on maintaining the City’s fiscal stability and place a high
priority on a number of key services. Survey respondents were read a list of a range of basic services
provided by the City, and were then asked to indicate whether or not it represented an important
funding priority and to what extent (extremely, very or somewhat important). There is broad
agreement that the City should focus on maintaining the City’s long-term financial viability, with 69
percent of respondents identifying this as an “extremely” or “very important” priority. Constituents
also identified a range of other specific services as highly important, including the following:






Maintaining storm drains to prevent pollutants, garbage and sediment from entering the Bay
(72% “extremely”/“very important”)
Repairing 80-year old deteriorating storm drains (69% “extremely”/“very important”)
Fixing potholes (60% “extremely”/“very important”)
Maintaining and repairing neighborhood streets (60% “extremely”/“very important”)
Fixing broken and potentially unsafe sidewalks (53% “extremely”/“very important”)

Given the value placed on key service priorities, by a two-to-one margin a solid majority (61%) of
constituents say they would
be supportive of a potential
temporary local sales tax
measure
to
address
community
needs.
Respondents also expressed a value for the inclusion of strong accountability and transparency
provisions if the City were to move forward with such a measure. These provisions include citizens’
oversight of expenditures, independent audits and the publication of expenditure reports for citizen
review to promote transparency and ensure that funds are used efficiently, effectively and as promised.
Overall, the results of the community survey are highly positive, demonstrating that constituents have
confidence in the leadership being provided by the City both in delivering basic services and managing
the City’s budget and finances.

Hall Fund transfers surplus revenues to the General Fund as operating revenues for the General Fund. The MLK Fund, Tidelands Fund and Sewer Fund all transfer revenues
to the General Fund to offset certain related operating costs incurred by the General fund on behalf of these benefitting funds. The Tideland Fund transfers monies to the
Debt Service Funds to pay for annual debt service for the Boats and Waterways Loan. Finally, the City's budget consolidates many Infrastructure Improvement projects into
the Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) fund, necessitating the transfer of monies from a number of different funds to the CIP fund to finance these projects.

FUND BALANCES AND RESERVE POLICIES
Governmental fund balances represent the net current assets of each fund. For budgeting purposes, Enterprise fund balances are presented as net current assets also. Net current
assets generally represent a fund’s cash and receivables, less its liabilities. The City’s fund balances are classified in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board
Statement Number 54 (GASB 54), Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions, which requires the City to classify its fund balances based on spending
constraints imposed on the use of resources. For programs with multiple funding sources, the City prioritizes and expends funds in the following order: Restricted, Committed,
Assigned, and Unassigned. Each category in the following hierarchy is ranked according to the degree of spending constraint:
Nonspendables represents balances set aside to indicate items do not represent available, spendable resources even though they are a component of assets. Fund balances
required to be maintained intact, and assets not expected to be converted to cash, such as prepaids, and notes receivable, are included. However, if proceeds realized
from the sale or collection of nonspendable assets are restricted, committed or assigned, then Nonspendable amounts are required to be presented as a component of
the applicable category.
Restricted fund balances have external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, laws, regulations, or enabling legislation which requires the resources
to be used only for a specific purpose. Encumbrances and nonspendable amounts subject to restrictions are included along with spendable resources.
Committed fund balances have constraints imposed by formal action of the City Council which may be altered only by formal action of the City Council. Encumbrances
and nonspendable amounts subject to council commitments are included along with spendable resources.
Assigned fund balances are amounts constrained by the City’s intent to be used for a specific purpose, but are neither restricted nor committed. Intent is expressed by
the City Council or its designee and may be changed at the discretion of the City Council or its designee. This category includes encumbrances; Nonspendables, when
it is the City’s intent to use proceeds or collections for a specific purpose, and residual fund balances, if any, of Special Revenue, Capital Projects and Debt Service
Funds which have not been restricted or committed.
Unassigned fund balance represents residual amounts that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned. This includes the residual general fund balance and residual
fund deficits, if any, of other governmental funds.

Budget Stabilization Shortfall Reserve Policy - Five percent (5%) of the City’s annual expenditures are set aside annually and assigned by the City Manager as
prescribed by Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 54, to provide for budget shortfalls as a result of 5% economic fluctuations in the
City’s revenue base.
Emergency Shortfall Reserve Policy - Ten percent (10%) of the City’s annual expenditures are set aside annually in unassigned general fund balance as the City's
emergency or "rainy day" fund and is subject to further appropriation by the City Council.
The following tables show the impact of the two-year Resource Allocation Plan on Fund Balances and reserve policies:

LABOR COSTS
In order to provide structural balance to the City’s financial position, a two-year (FY10-12) planning effort manifested a comprehensive strategy to lower the cost of labor. The
strategy was implemented after six months of negotiations with the City’s labor force. As a result of this comprehensive approach to labor cost reform, it is estimated that each
new employee hired to replace an existing employee will have a savings in current dollars of $50,000. Average attrition for the City is one (1) Safety and one (1) non-safety
position per year. In other words, future budgets realize $100,000 labor cost savings until the entire current workforce is replaced. However, Sausalito’s workforce consists of
older employees, and the City forecasts accelerated attrition in five to ten years. The implementation of this strategy prior to future accelerated attrition is an investment that
achieves the strategic plan goal of fiscal sustainability and resiliency. The following chart demonstrates the results of the City strategy as depicted by the lowering of labor costs
as percentages of total General Fund expenditures, and the realigning of salaries as a percentage of total labor costs:

PENSION REFORM
Substantially all City employees are eligible to participate in pension plans offered by California Public Employees Retirement System (CALPERS) an agent multiple employer
defined benefit pension plan which acts as a common investment and administrative agent for its participating member employers. CALPERS provides retirement and disability
benefits, annual cost of living adjustments and death benefits to plan members, who must be public employees and beneficiaries. The City’s employees participate in the separate
Safety (Police) and Miscellaneous (all other) Employee Plans. Benefit provisions under both Plans are established by State statute and City resolution. Benefits are based on
years of credited service, equal to one year of full time employment.
In FY2012-13 the City enacted a number of pension reforms.

ended June 30, 2013.
Closed Tier 1 to new entrants,; and created Tier 2 for Classic employees; and created Tier

Recently the City’s Actuary, John Bartel, reported to the City Council that the City of Sausalito’s
pension reforms optimized the available options for reforms a municipality is legally authorized to
do. He further stated that these reforms positioned the City substantially better than most all other
California municipalities by lowering annual pension costs and accrued actuarial liabilities. Finally, he reported that in his opinion the reforms left the City able to meet its
future pension obligations.
The actuary then summarized the significant changes CalPERS enacted in FY 2013. The new actuarial policies for rate pools, actuarial assumptions, contribution policies and
smoothing formulas are designed to not only bring the City’s market value of assets to 100% of the AAL over a 30-year period, but also to ensure that there are adequate assets
to pay the retiree benefits when they come due.
The City annually contributes 100% of its required contribution to CalPERS. The market value as of June 30, 2012 (the most recent actuarial report from CalPERS) of the
accumulated assets contributed towards the $74.4 million accrued actuarial liability (AAL) was $51.8 million. It's important to note that the total AAL is an estimated,
cumulative future liability, it does not represent a liability due and payable immediately. Nor does it represent a legal debt obligation. The difference between the market value

P a g e 41 | 181

INVESTING IN THE QUALITY OF SAUSALITO’S FUTURE

CITY OF SAUSALITO

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

of assets and the accrued liability on that date was $22.6 million. However, since 2012, CalPERS investment returns have increased the City’s market value of assets by 13.2%
for fiscal year ended 2013, and an estimated 12% for fiscal year ended 2014; resulting in an estimated total of $65.6 million (before additional City contributions and retiree
benefit payments). Further, and as mentioned in the bullet points above, the City liquidated the CalPERS side funds for a total of $1.7 million thereby reducing the accrued
liability to $72.7 million. I.e., a total of $15.5 million in FY 2013 and FY 2014 market gains, and the FY 2013 lump sum $1.7 million side fund payment was dedicated to
reduce the unfunded liability at June 30, 2012.
In summary, the City considers its pension obligations very seriously, continually examines all of its the options to reduce pension obligations and annual pension costs, and
when feasible and legally permissible implements fiscally responsive measures that ensure the long-term fiscal viability of continuing to provide excellent municipal services to
its citizens.
OPEB REFORM
The City of Sausalito provides very conservative health care benefits for retired employees. Only twenty-nine current annuitants, and thirty-six eligible current employees who
retire(d) after 20 years of service at or after age 50 for police and certain legacy firefighters; and at or after age 55 for other employees, receive total medical benefits up to the
Kaiser single retiree premium. This benefit was eliminated for all future employees effective July 1, 2012. As mandated by the CalPERS medical program, all employees who
retire at age 50 or over with at least 5 years of service receive benefits equal to the CalPERS minimum employer contribution – currently $112 per month.
The City of Sausalito, has long recognized the importance of addressing “Other-than-pensions Post Employment health care Benefits” (OPEB) annual required contributions
(ARC) and unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities (UAAL).

In fiscal 2005, the City set-aside $50,000 in a separate internal services fund to partially offset the UAAL;
In both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, the City set-aside $150,000 each year in a separate internal services fund in order to partially offset the UAAL;
In fiscal 2008, the City Council adopted a policy through budget adoption and implementation to set aside 1% of employees’ salaries in a separate internal services
fund in order to continue the practice to partially offset the UAAL;
In mid fiscal 2008, after accumulating the above noted $350,000, and adopting the policy to continue the practice of setting aside 1% of salaries into a separate internal
service find to partially offset the UAAL, the City Council’s Finance Committee deliberated on the choices of (a) pre-funding OPEB liabilities in an irrevocable trust
or (b) continue to set aside monies internally. Although, current accounting and actuarial standards do not permit monies not in an irrevocable trust as credits against UAAL, the
City decided not to invest monies in an irrevocable trust with an investment strategy to achieve the 5% actuarial discount rate due to foreseen economic market weakness. In retrospect, the
decision to not place the monies into an irrevocable trust was momentarily fortuitous as the equity markets plunged late 2008 and early 2009 – the City would have lost about 50% of the
money it had set-aside.
In fiscal 2009, besides setting aside funds in a separate internal service fund, the City began exploring all other options for reducing OPEB ARC and UAAL including
investigating feasibility of working with other cities to find solutions, implementing a two-tier benefits system for future new hires, a dollar cap on benefits, and
converting the current defined benefits plan into a defined contribution plan. Accordingly, and in order to provide structural balance to the City’s financial position, a

CITY OF SAUSALITO

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

two-tier planning effort was initiated in 2010 that manifested a comprehensive strategy to lower the cost of labor. The strategy was implemented on July 1, 2012. The
OPEB reform accomplished the following:
o Replaced Defined Benefit (DB)-OPEB for current employees with 3 years or less service with Defined Contribution (DC)-OPEB and eliminated DB-OPEB
for 14 employees with less than 3 years of service
o Offered a one-time option to all employees with more than 3 years of service to opt out of DB-OPEB and replace with DC-OPEB and thereby eliminated DBOPEB for 17 employees with more than 3 years of service
o Eliminated total medical benefits OPEB for all future employees
resulting in a closed pool of full medical retiree health care benefits for
the Police, SEIU Local 1021 and unrepresented employees and
accordingly justified to continue with a Pay-As-You-Go approach for
OPEB funding. Specifically:
 Reduced the actuarially liability by $1,000,000
 Reduced the annual OPEB normal cost by $350,000;
 Effective with the June 26, 2012 annexation agreement, the Fire
employee component of the normal cost and actuarial accrued
liability is now a completely closed pool and the normal cost
and actuarial accrued liability will be eventually totally
eliminated.
 As of June 30, 2014, the City will have accumulated over
$1,000,000 in the separate internal services as partial offsets for
the remaining Police, SEIU Local 1021 and unrepresented
employees actuarial accrued liabilities.
Assuming a mortality age of 90 years, the accompanying graph depicts that the phase out of the full medical cost OPEB program is 60 years.

GENERAL FUND
GENERAL FUND SUMMARY
The General Fund is the principal operating fund of a government and is typically used to account for most of a government’s departments. As a rule, the general fund should
be used to account for all of a government’s activities unless there is a compelling legal or managerial reason to use some other fund type. Governments may report only a
single general fund. The following charts depict projected General Fund revenues, expenditures and transfers for FY 2014 through 2016.

TAXES
Property Taxes: The Property Taxes category is comprised of the following types of property tax:






Net Secured Property Taxes
o Secured levied
o Supplemental roll
o Unitary
o Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund (ERAF)
o Property tax Administration Fee (PTAF)
Unsecured Property Taxes
Property Transfer Taxes
Property Tax in lieu of Vehicle License Fee (VLF).
Net Secured Property Taxes are assessed at the beginning of the calendar year, then levied, collected and distributed by the County during the following fiscal under the
Teeter Plan where the City receives 55% of its levied property taxes in December, another 40% the following May, with the remaining 5% distributed two months later
in July. In addition to levied secured property tax, the County collects and distributes to the City a monthly amount of property tax pertaining to supplemental roll
property tax (properties transferred after the levy date and taxes collected with the property’s related “closing costs”). The City receives secured property tax in the form
of unitary tax, the amount of property taxes generated from utility companies. Utility companies allocate property taxes to all taxing entities statewide through a special
legislated formula. The City receives secured property taxes reimbursements from the excess monies distributed under the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund
(ERAF) shifts from 1992-1994. The County is permitted under Senate Bill 2557 to assess taxing entities for the County’s share of costs for property tax administration.
Unsecured roll property taxes are taxes on property for which the lien is not sufficient to assure payment of the tax. Because the tax is not secured by real property (such
as land) the tax is called “unsecured.”
Property transfer taxes are taxes imposed on the purchaser of real property based on the value of the property
Property tax in lieu of VLF are taxes transferred from the State to replace the elimination of Vehicle License Fees.

Sales and Use Taxes are taxes imposed on the total retail price of any tangible personal property and the use or storage of such property when sales tax is not paid. Sales taxes
are elastic in nature and generally reflect the overall tourism economic climate. Specifically, 44% of Sausalito’s sales tax is generated from restaurants and 17% from retail
establishments. The other 39% of sales tax is from more resident serving, or business-to-business economic segments.
Transient Occupancy Tax are taxes imposed on occupants for privilege of occupying room(s) in Sausalito hotels. Transient Occupancy Taxes are also elastic in nature and
generally reflect the overall economic climate.

SERVICE INDICATORS
Research has shown that current data on policing are insufficient for either measuring performance or doing good comparative research on police organizations because they
generally fail to capture the full range of work that police do due to the nature of their work. Sausalito Police Department captures the majority of calls for service and uses this
data as a service indicator. Part 1 and Part 2 crimes are tracked by the FBI and are also a useful tool in gaining insight into service indicators.
CHART 1-1 shows the calls for service for the past 5 years. This measurement reflects all Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) incidents which include calls for police response
from our community as well as self-initiated activity by our officers in the field.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION
The Department’s mission is to provide quality, professional, effective, respectful and timely services to residents, businesses, City staff and guests. We focus on integrity in our
relationships --- both with our peers and our customers; on customer service and satisfaction; and on pride in our work, our workplaces and our community -- holding sacred
the community’s trust.
The Department is responsible for the design, construction, management and maintenance of the City's infrastructure, including streets, trees, sidewalks, stairs, steps, pathways,
parking lots and other rights-of-way; parks; creeks(in public easements, or public right-of-way); shorelines; sewers and storm drains; buildings and structures; vehicles and
equipment; street lights and traffic signals. In addition, we facilitate environmental compliance (including storm water pollution prevention), sustainability, protection of trees;
and floodplain administration. The Department of Public Works is a key responding agency in emergencies involving our infrastructure as well as weather and other disasters
with the potential for adverse impacts to public health or the environment.
STRATEGIC PLAN
The Department of Public Works is responsible for managing the implementation of projects and studies consistent with the Strategic Plan Goal #2: Improve and continue to

SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS
Special revenue funds are established by a government to collect money that must be used for a specific project, either by law or by policy. Special revenue funds provide an
extra level of accountability and transparency to taxpayers that their revenue dollars will go toward an intended purpose. For example, Sausalito establishes a special revenue
fund to pay expenses associated with gas taxes because the state requires that the monies can only be used for certain street related expenses.
The following chart summarizes revenues and expenses for each of the City’s Special Revenue funds:

City’s roads due to numerous heavy loads from the traffic brought on by construction activity. The City of Sausalito uses this money for the sole purpose of repairing City
streets (including striping and signage).
ONGOING TASKS

COUNTY MEASURE A AND B FUND
DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION
Voters in Marin approved Measure A in November of 2004. It is a ½ percent Sales Tax for Marin County Transportation purposes. The Measure A authorized the formation
of Transportation Authority of Marin to administer Measure A revenues. The funds must be used for transportation purposes. This can include street and roads projects, local
transit projects, bicycle projects, and pedestrian projects. The Sausalito Budget programmed TAM funds for the Street Repair Program. If there are remaining amounts they
will be allocated to go into Measure A Fund balances. On November 2, 2010, Marin residents voted to pass Measure B which increased the annual vehicle registration fee
by $10 to help fund transportation improvements, also administered by the Transportation Authority of Marin. The Fee will fund programs that: 1) Repair and maintain local
streets, roads, and multi-use pathways in the County, including neighborhood and residential priority locations; 2)Make public transportation easier to use and more efficient,
particularly for the senior and disabled population in Marin County; 3)Make it easier to get to work or school, whether by driving, using public transportation, bicycling, or
walking; and 4) Result in the reduction of pollution from cars and trucks, by reducing the need to drive and encouraging the use of alternative fuel vehicles.
ONGOING TASKS


Annually execute formalized funding agreements setting the funding for certain street and roads construction projects within the City

STRATEGIC PLAN
Transferring these funds to the Capital Projects Fund for the maintenance, improvement or construction of public streets is consistent with the Strategic Plan goal of improving
and continuing to maintain the infrastructure, emphasizing long-term asset management.

STORM DRAINAGE FUND
DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION
The purpose of the Storm Drain Fund is to account for the use of monies generated by the fee imposed on property owners by the City’s Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention
Ordinance. This Ordinance, in order to ensure the future health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Sausalito, established a funding source, to provide for
the maintenance and repair of the City's storm water drainage facilities, to provide capital improvements to the City's storm drainage system, and to provide other clean storm
water activities.
ONGOING TASKS




Provides for maintenance and capital improvement projects for the City’s storm drainage system.
Comply with the mandates of federal and state requirements regulating storm water quality, including the Marin County Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program
(MCSTOPP)and the Baseline Urban Runoff Control Program (BURCP) Basin Plan Permit
Prepares storm water runoff charges to be placed on the tax rolls

STRATEGIC PLAN
Transferring these funds to the Capital Projects Fund for the maintenance, improvement or construction of storm water facilities is consistent with the Strategic Plan goal of
improving and continuing to maintain the infrastructure, emphasizing long-term asset management.
Like many California cities, new federal and state storm water mandates and regulations have highlighted years of deferred maintenance for storm drain infrastructure. These
new mandates require stringent day-to-day operating procedures, and will require significant infrastructure investment. The preparation of a Storm Water Master Plan, and
repairing and replacing the City’s aging Storm Water infrastructure is a high priority for the City, yet there is not an identified revenue source for an estimated $1 million annual
infrastructure replacement program.

ENTERPRISE FUNDS
Enterprise Funds are used to account for operations including debt service that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private businesses - where the intent of the
governing body is that cost (expenses including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis is financed or recovered primarily
through user charges; or where the governing body has determined that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance, public policy, management control accountability, or other purposes.

SEWER FUND
DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION
The City of Sausalito owns and operates portions of the sanitary sewer system conveying wastewater to the Sausalito-Marin City Sanitary District (SMCSD) for treatment and
discharge to the Bay. The Sewer Enterprise Fund accounts for the provision of sewer services to residences and businesses of the City. All activities to provide such services are
accounted for in this fund, including but not limited to, administration, operations, capital improvements, maintenance, financing, billing and collections.
Every five years the City undertakes a sewer rate revenue study to develop a five year financial plan. The FY 2014-16 budget reflects the implementation of the financial rates
approved by the City Council on May 6, 2014.
The City’s financial plan addresses four primary objectives:





Meeting Operations Costs: The sewer utility must generate sufficient revenue to cover the expenses of sewer operations, including administration,
maintenance, and collection operations. For Fiscal Years 2014/15 through 2018/19, the net annual revenue requirement (total annual expenses, including
debt service, less non-rate revenues) is approximately $2.2 to $2.5 million.



Meeting Capital Improvement Costs: The sewer utility must also be able to fund necessary capital improvements. The City identified over $5 million in
priority and urgent capital improvements for the next five years. The City plans to fund the vast majority of these costs with a debt financing.

Maintaining Adequate Bond Coverage: The City is required by its existing bond covenant to maintain a coverage ratio of rates to debt service obligations of at least
1.1 for the outstanding state revolving fund loan and will likely be expected to maintain a coverage ratio of 1.15 to 1.20 for future planned debt issuances. The benefit
of maintaining a higher coverage ratio is that it strengthens the City’s credit rating, which can help lower the interest rates for debt-funded capital projects and reduce
annual debt service payments for future debt issues.


Building and Maintaining Reserve Funds: The Utility maintains sufficient reserves for the following target reserve fund levels:
o

Operating Reserves equal to 25% of the Utility’s budgeted annual operating expenses. This reserve target is equal to a three month (or 90-day) cash
cushion for normal operations. An Operating Reserve is intended to promote financial stability in the event of any unexpected short-term or emergency
cash needs.

o

Capital Reserves equal to 3% of net depreciable capital assets of the utility for capital repair and replacement needs. This target serves simply as a
starting point for addressing longer-term needs. If ratepayers can generate revenues at this level and pace, they will have reserved a partial cash
resource that can be applied toward future replacement and rehabilitation needs, thereby eliminating the need to borrow this portion of the capital
cost of maintaining the utility’s collection system infrastructure.

o

Debt Reserve equal to the reserve requirement for the outstanding state revolving fund loan and the expected reserve requirement for the planned
new debt obligation, which is equal to the maximum annual debt service payment due on outstanding bonds.

CITY OF SAUSALITO

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

BAY CITIES JOINT POWERS INSURANCE AUTHORITY
The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to workers’ compensation and general liability. The City participates in joint powers agreements. On July 1, 1977, a Joint
Powers Agreement (the “Agreement”) was entered into between member cities and the Marin County Risk Management Authority for workers’ compensation coverage (City
of Sausalito joined on October 1, 1982). In July 1978, the Agreement was extended to include coverage for both auto and general liability exposures. On July 1, 1978, a new
Joint Powers Agreement was established for the liability coverage, known as the Marin Cities Liability Management Authority (City of Sausalito joined on October 1, 1986).
Effective July 1, 1996, the City transferred its excess liability coverage to Bay Cities Joint Powers Insurance Authority (the “Authority”). Effective July 1, 2003, the Marin
County Risk Management Authority was dissolved and the City transferred its workers compensation coverage to the Bay Cities Joint Powers Insurance Authority.
The City reports all of the workers’ compensation activities in an internal service fund. Claims expenditures and liabilities are reported in the internal service fund when it is
probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. All of the City’s general and ERMA (Employment Risk Management Authority)
liability risk management activities are reported in an internal service fund.


WORKERS COMPENSATION FUND

DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION
The Workers’ Compensation Fund is self-insured for the first $150,000 of loss per occurrence. Excess coverage is provided by an outside insurance carrier up to $1,000,000
to statutory limits.
As defined by Government Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 10 (“GASB -10”), the Bay Cities Joint Powers Insurance Authority is “a claims servicing or
account pool.” The Authority manages separate accounts for each pool member from which losses and expenses of that member are paid, up to the self-insured retention
limit. The Authority purchases commercial excess insurance. The annual assessment of each member includes allocations for loss payments, expenses, and excess insurance
premiums. The Authority has a policy under which there is an annual evaluation of the assets of each pool member in comparison to future liabilities. The “financial
risk position” of each member is determined by subtracting case reserves, incurred but not reported (IBNR) amounts and claim development from the m em b e r s ’ cash
b a la nc es. If a negative risk position is found, a supplemental element is added to its annual assessment.
ONGOING TASKS

CITY INFRASTRUCTURE
Infrastructure includes the basic physical structures, systems, and facilities needed to provide services to residents and for the functioning of a community and its economy,
such as sidewalks, streets, storm drains, parks, police facilities, and sewer systems. Infrastructure impacts the public health, safety, and the quality of life for Sausalito
communities as well as the tourism industry which is an important part of the City’s economy. Decisions made regarding infrastructure projects are very important because
they are generally large and expensive, and the assets they create will likely be required for decades of public use.
Asset management is a recommended practice for effectively and sustainably managing assets at a desired level of service for the lowest life cycle cost. Asset Management
provides needed information on existing assets, such as condition, so that City staff can develop optimal strategies for maintenance and rehabilitation or replacement of assets.
The City has an important Asset Management efforts underway, including conducting condition assessments and developing standard City-wide minimum guidelines for
managing assets. Ultimately, Asset Management will provide a sound basis for the City to identify the magnitude of the backlog; prioritize needed capital projects; and effectively
focus limited resources.
The City’s is responsible for the care and upkeep of existing infrastructure assets, also known as Maintenance & Repair (M&R), as well as rehabilitation or replacement of those
assets when needed. In addition, the City is responsible for providing needed new or expanded infrastructure. Providing ongoing M&R, such as resurfacing streets and repairing
sidewalks or filling potholes, is vital for maintaining the condition of assets. Compounding the problem, as assets continue to deteriorate, the cost of repair will exponentially
increase and can result in peripheral damage. For example, deferring roof replacement could later result in needing to replace the roof structural members, walls, and color of
a building. When M&R is not fully funded, it contributes to deferred maintenance and capital costs. Like many California cities, the City of Sausalito has not fully funded
M&R in many previous years due to tight budgetary constraints and competing priorities. As a result the City now has a backlog in deferred capital projects just for storm
drains, streets, and sidewalks. This estimate is anticipated to significantly increase as information is collected in FY 2015 on the condition of other City facilities, sidewalks,
and park assets.
The City is also responsible to ensuring compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA mandates all cities to develop a transition plan for the installation
of curb ramps or other forms of sloping access at every location where a pedestrian path of travel crosses a curb. The ADA further mandates that all publicly funded buildings,
structures, and related facilities shall be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. A transition plan must also provide a schedule for necessary improvements to
provide access to those citizens with disabilities. Generally speaking, an ADA Transition Plan is intended to describe the need, plan improvements and create safe and useable
pedestrian facilities for each and every member within the community, and assure compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations and standards. The document is
intended to provide guidance for a variety of facilities within the City’s public right-of-way. These facilities include City-owned buildings, parks and recreation facilities, streets
and roadways, underground and above ground utilities, vehicular and pedestrian signal systems, signage systems, on-street and off-street city-owned parking facilities, sidewalks
with curb ramps at intersections, planting strips and buffers, pedestrian activity areas, and unimproved open spaces that are part of the public right-of way.
In 2008, the City of Sausalito last updated its ADA Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan. The City’s Transition Plan is now outdated as technologies, case law around ADA
implementation and City facilities and programs evolved over the six years. In addition, the City found it difficult to consistently monitor the progress of the 2008 transition
plan. As people with disabilities have requested accommodations under the ADA, City staff and managers and federal technical assistance providers have learned a great deal

FY 2014 – 2016

about implementing the Act. The City’s Self-Evaluation and Transition Plan requires revision in order to reflect best practices in ADA compliance and the realities of today’s
implementation environment. The City recognizes the need for increased interdepartmental and intradepartmental communication about ADA compliance and increased
responsiveness to community ADA-related concerns. The updated Transition Plan will be completed in 2015 and it is also expected to significantly increase the required
investment in city infrastructure improvements.
GENERAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND
DEPARTMENT DESCRIPTION
The General Capital Improvement Fund is a Multi-Year Capital Improvements Plan for infrastructure not otherwise reported in the City’s Enterprise Funds, such as Sewer
collection system and lift pumps, Parking equipment (on-street and City-owned off-street), and the MLK facility. Infrastructure projects in the Capital Improvement Fund
include the following categories: traffic and transportation projects, storm drains, buildings and waterfront projects, parks and recreation projects, pedestrian and bicycle
projects, city-owned rights-of-way, medians land and open space, and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) projects and major studies.
A multi-year plan is an important tool identifying a comprehensive solution for infrastructure issues. This plan depicts what projects are planned; what projects are needed;
what revenue is projected from existing funding sources; and what priority projects lack a funding source. City staff can more effectively plan for infrastructure projects to
address community needs over five-years (or more) rather than in an annual budget. The Multi-Year Plan also enables staff to plan in advance to identify needed funding for
projects, such as bond issuances, federal and state grants, and other opportunities.
The six year capital improvement plan 2014-15 through 2019-20 identifies over $30 million in proposed infrastructure projects of which only approximately $6 million is funded
through current City resources. Grants, contributions, new Storm Drain fees, and other revenue sources will be required to provide additional resources to finance required
infrastructure.

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

STRATEGIC PLAN AND PRIORITY CALENDAR
STRATEGIC PLAN
On November 22, 2013, the City Council had its semi-annual strategic planning session. The following session notes were accepted by the Council at their subsequent
regularly scheduled meeting.
SESSION SUMMARY
PRESENT
Adam Politzer, Jennifer Tejada, Jonathan Leone, Rhett Redelings-MacDermott, John Rohrbacher, Jonathon Goldman, Kurtis Skoog, Thomas Theodores, Jeremy Graves,
Abbot Chambers, Loren Umbertis, Ray Withy, Mary Wagner, Jim Irving, Fred Hilliard, Andrew Davidson, Mike Langford, Herb Weiner, Debbie Pagliaro, Charlie Francis,
and facilitator Sherry Lund.
OBJECTIVES
1.
2.
3.

Agree on a long-term vision for the City.
Agree on major strategies to achieve that vision.
Agree on major strategic objectives for each strategy and a general timetable for achieving them.

COUNCIL'S VISION OF SAUSALITO 15-20 YEARS FROM NOW - THE PICTURE WE WANT TO STEER TOWARD:










We would have preserved the magic of Sausalito and maintained the small village character that is also a little funky. There would not have been a significant growth
in population. It will still be a great and special place to live and work - a place where you pinch yourself to see if you're really awake.
We would still be a small town with the recognition that we are also a world destination and the gateway to Marin, not urban and not suburban. We would maintain
balance among these competing personas. We would not have the feeling of Carmel (where everything has to be just so), Laguna Niguel, San Francisco, Novato,
Tiburon or Belvedere. We would still exist as a town.
We would have a plan for the City.
Sausalito would be welcoming to visitors. There would still be tremendous tourism, but auto traffic would continue to decrease and tourists are mostly here briefly - a
couple of hours. We would have maintained the efficiency of downtown through a transportation plan, including water traffic. Not all traffic would come from
Alexander.
We would have preserved the beautiful waterfront and also not have created an all-new, polished waterfront.
Marinship would have been brought into the total community, so it's not seen as separate. We would have brought Sausalito together.
We would have maintained the historic character - maintenance of older houses and buildings so that they all didn't become tear-downs.

FY 2014 – 2016

Schools, parks, and playgrounds make it welcoming to young families. It's also welcoming to seniors and have senior housing. We would appeal to a range of people
to live here who have a range of economic circumstances and means. There would still be an artists' community.
There would be a wealth of talent, centers of innovation, and we would have created vitality.
The City would have continued to manage finances well and done long-term financial planning, achieving fiscal sustainability. Basic services would still be provided.
We would have kept our eye on pension costs.
Our infrastructure would be sound and secure, even though it doesn't show. We will have had a plan for loss of land to water.
There would be a solid tax base among businesses, residences, and tourism. We would have assured our economic vitality. There would be low-impact industry,
trades of the future, and marine workers can stay.
We'd be a leader in environmental sustainability and kept our Green City focus.

CITY-WIDE STRATEGIES
1.

 Continue to work to achieve zero waste.
 Reduce the City's carbon footprint.
 What is the role of IT - assess delivery model.
Strategy 5
Communicate to the public what can be done online. Consider a single portal to pay for anything.
Consider if outside contractor could assist with strengthening communication in the community.
Finish street maintenance.
Hazard mitigation

NEXT STEPS:




Staff objectives should be driven off a combination of "Keeping the Lights On" objectives and Strategies/Goals,
"Keeping the Lights On" objectives and Strategies/Goals should feed the budgeting process. Things that don't lead to the vision or relate to strategies/goals or
essential "keeping the lights on" services suggest that they are a distraction rather than taking Council/Staff in the direction set.

PRIORITY CALENDAR
Six years ago Staff introduced the Priority Calendar to the City Council as a tool to prioritize City projects. The Priority Calendar was effective identifying City projects
including, Capital Projects, City Ordinances, enhanced community services and addressing State and Federal mandates. The City did not have the resources to tackle all the
projects at one time, but over the course of six years made significant progress on identified priority items and completing them.
During the initial years the Priority Calendar focused on “Back to the Basic” items such as EPA compliance, Disaster Preparedness, Certifying the City’s Housing Element
and building the Public Safety Facilities. The last three years, the community and the Boards and Commissions introduced projects that expanded the number of Priority
Calendar items for City Council’s review, such as the Historic Guidelines regulations, the Single Use Bag Ordinance, the Dunphy Park Master Plan, the Down Town Parking
Plan and landscape beautification projects.
The success of the Priority Calendar has effectively focused Staff time and financial resources to the highest prioritized projects, and by doing so has helped the City complete
many of the Priority Calendar projects. Last fall the City Council began aligning the Priority Calendar items with the City’s Strategic Plan. This action allowed Staff, over the
course of the year, to review the Priority Calendar and move projects from the Priority Calendar on to the Department list of ongoing projects that require dedicated Staff
time. This action will continue to give the City Council the ability to align
the Priority Calendar projects at its annual update of the City’s Strategic Plan
As the City began the 2014-15 Priority Calendar process, staff recommended
a transition to a new priority calendar setting process as depicted in the
accompanying diagram.
The recommended change was to move ongoing projects out of the Priority
Calendar and on to the Department work plans and they are included in the
Priority Projects sections in the respective Department’s sections above.
The remaining Priority Calendar became items that are either new projects
introduced by the community or items that remain on the Calendar that have
not been identified as ongoing projects. The following list plots the transition
to the adopted priority calendar items for FY 2014-15:

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

LONG TERM FISCAL PLAN
The City of Sausalito utilizes financial models to provide the City Council and Management with the means to create: interactive multi-year financial forecasts, historic trend
and statistical analyses; and, monthly budget vs. actual variance analyses. Both the annual forecasting and monthly variance analysis models are 100% Excel-based and are
customized to meet the City’s particular financial planning, analysis and reporting requirements.




Forecasts are used to: (1) create a strategic context for evaluating the annual budget, (2) to establish a base-line for measuring the long-term effects of decisions, (3) to
test the economic effects of best-case and worst-case funding scenarios, and (4) to establish a baseline projection of revenues, expenditures, and future cash flows and
fund balances which are key metrics in evaluating the City’s financial health.
The models are calibrated with actual financial results on a monthly, quarterly, year-to-date, prior-year and projected year-end basis in order to more accurately measure
financial performance and proactively identify potential future budget challenges and opportunities.

The City models all funds individually and by their fund types (General, Special Revenue, Debt Service, Capital Projects, Enterprise, and Internal Services). The models contain
every historical revenue and expense line-item within each classification, and forecasts by line-item category.
After assigning revenue productivity with level of service consumption, the results of the modelling were presented to the City Council during their November 22, 2013 Strategic
Planning meeting. The following conclusions were reached with the City Council:




City’s current levels of service are adequately funded (stable);
Budget is structurally balanced and sound (sustainable); and
Reserve balances are sufficiently funded based on a risk analysis and mitigation strategy (resilient).

However the City Council also recognized that the models’ demonstrated that future additional resources would be needed to accommodate the significant infrastructure
investment needed in the next ten years in addition to the increasing demand for enhanced levels of police service, landscape maintenance, recreation activities, expanded
library hours, code enforcement, building inspections, current planning and development review engineering permitting, etc. The City does not currently have adequate funds
to address these urgent infrastructure and enhanced level of service needs.
The following charts are excerpted from the fiscal models and are presented to support the November 22, 2013 strategic plan conclusions of the City Council strategic plan
conclusions:

Government spending limitation sec. designates that the appropriations limit for any fiscal year pursuant to Sec. 1 shall be adjusted as follows: (a) In the event that the
financial responsibility of providing services is transferred, in whole or in part, whether by annexation, incorporation or otherwise, from one entity of government to
another, then for the year in which such transfer becomes effective the appropriations limit of the transferee entity shall be increased by such reasonable amount as the said
entities shall mutually agree and the appropriations limit of the transferor entity shall be decreased by the same amount.

GLOSSARY OF BUDGET TERMS
GLOSSARY OF BUDGET TERMS
Appropriation - Amounts of money authorized by the City Council to be spent during the fiscal year.
Appropriation Limit – A restriction on the amount of revenue that can be appropriated in any fiscal year imposed by Propositions 4 and 111. The Limit is based on actual
appropriations during the 1978-79 fiscal year, and is increased each year using the growth of population and inflation.
Assessed Value - The value of property used as a basis for levying property taxes.
Assessments - Levied on property owners to pay for improvements directly benefiting their property.
Bonds - Proceeds from the sale of debt, the principal that must be repaid with interest.
Budget - A financial plan for a specified period of time that matches planned revenues and expenditures to municipal services, goals and objectives. The City of Sausalito
prepared a two-year budget 2008-2010 but is adopting each year annually.
Debt Service - Payments of principal and interest on indebtedness incurred to finance the construction of a capital project.
Department Revenue - Selected fees, charges, rent or other income derived by a department from its own activities.
Designated Unreserved Fund Balance - Net financial resources of a governmental fund that are spendable or available for appropriation, but which have been earmarked by
the City Council for some specific purpose.
Encumbrance - Reservation of funds for expenditure at a future date, usually under a purchase order.
Expense - As the authorization to spend is exercised, an appropriation becomes an “expense” or “expenditure”, i.e., the amount expended.
Fiscal Year - The 12-month accounting period used by the City, from July 1 through June 30th of the following calendar year.
Fund - A separate fiscal and accounting entity used by governments to segregate resources related to specific activities. The City’s finances are distributed among 37 separate
funds required by the City, State or Federal government, or by proper accounting practice. Fund types include:

STRATEGIC RESOURCE ALLOCATION PLAN – TWO YEAR BUDGET

FY 2014 – 2016

Fund Types:
The General Fund is the principal operating fund of a government and is typically used to account for most of a government’s departments. As a rule, the general fund should
be used to account for all of a government’s activities unless there is a compelling legal or managerial reason to use some other fund type. Governments may report only a
single general fund.
Special Revenue Funds are revenues earmarked for specific purposes. One example is our “Gas Tax Fund” that records gas tax revenues, which may only be used for street
repairs. Another example is the “Construction Impact Fees Fund.”
Debt Service Funds are funds to account for the payment and accumulation of resources related to general long-term debt principal and interest.
Capital Project Funds are used to account for construction of major public facilities or acquisition by the general government. The “Library Building Fund” and “General
Capital Improvement Fund” are examples of capital project funds.
Enterprise Funds are used to account for operations including debt service that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private businesses - where the intent of the
governing body is that cost (expenses including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis is financed or recovered primarily
through user charges; or where the governing body has determined that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for
capital maintenance , public policy, management control accountability, or other purposes. The “Martin Luther King Fund” is an example of an enterprise fund. Another
example is the “Sewer Fund” that records sewer fee collections, which may only be used for maintenance of the sewer main system throughout the city.
Internal Service Funds are enterprises that sell service internally to other City entities, rather than to the general public. The “Vehicle Replacement Fund” is an example of
Internal Service Funds.
Agency Funds are used to account for accumulations of resources that will be used to pay debt of the Local Improvement Districts for which the City acts as administrator and
pay agent. “The Downtown Sidewalk Assessment District Fund” and the “Sunshine Underground Assessment District Fund” are examples of agency funds.
Fund Balances - The excess of the total assets of a fund over its total liabilities and reserves.
Governmental Funds - this includes the general, special revenue, debt service and capital projects fund. They are accounted for on a financial flow basis, measuring available
spendable resources and changes in net current assets.
Interest - Income earned on the investment of available cash balances.

FY 2014 – 2016

Inter-fund Transfers - The reallocation of money from one fund to another. The receiving fund must spend the transferred money in a way that complies with any restrictions
placed on the money when it was originally received by the donor fund.
Intergovernmental - Revenues shared with the City by the State (such as the Homeowners’ Exemption, Motor Vehicle License Fees, Gas Tax), or Federal government.
Liabilities - Amount of obligations a fund has to make on future payments, such as accounts payable, deferred revenues or amounts due other funds.
Operations - Departmental costs for employees, contract services, repairs and maintenance, internal services, supplies, equipment and other expenses. These expenses are
generally predictable and consistent with the on-going service demands of the City and the impact of inflation.
Non-Departmental - Expenses incurred at the fund level, which are not charged to an individual department, such as retiree health benefits, worker’s compensation, liability
insurance, and inter-fund transfers.
Projects - Long-term investments in public facilities and infrastructure; also known as capital improvements. Amounts spent may vary widely from year to year.
Reserved Fund balance - The portion of fund balance that is not available for appropriation because it is legally restricted (e.g., encumbrances).
Revenue - Money received from taxes, licenses, permits, interest, fees for service, bonds or from other governments by the City during the fiscal year.
Subventions – Revenues collected by the State or other level of government and allocated to the City on a formula basis. The major subventions include motor vehicle in-lieu
and gasoline taxes.
User Fees - Charges of a voluntary nature paid by persons receiving a service in exchange for the fee (such as recreation activities).
