2014 Unified Government Proposed Budget
County Administrator’s Budget Message
Mayor Mark Holland and Unified Government Commissioners:
The financial challenges facing the Unified Government in 2014 are daunting. The national and local
economies are getting stronger, but the recovery to pre-recession levels is slow. Despite major
development projects in Wyandotte County, such as the opening of the Hollywood Casino at Kansas
Speedway, construction of the Cerner Continuous Campus and expansion at the General Motors plant
revenues are not yet returning to the Unified Government treasury rapidly enough to cover increased
expenses. This makes 2014 another difficult budget year.

Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas are not alone. The National League of Cities annual Local
Economic Conditions Survey finds cities across the nation also struggling to keep up with the demand
for services. The factors are the same across the nation. New housing starts are showing only tepid
improvement; commercial and residential property values are not rebounding; business activity and
health of the retail sector remains anemic; persistent lack of growth in incomes and employment is
stalling the economic recovery.

Across the State of Kansas, the City of Wichita faces an $8.8-million budget shortfall in 2014 and is
looking to lay-off 65 employees and furlough others. The City of Topeka is calling for an increase of
nearly 5 mills in the property tax rate while also cutting more than $750,000 from the budget. Lawrence
and Douglas County are both raising property taxes. Olathe is proposing a 3/8-cent infrastructure sales
tax.

While the Proposed 2014 Budget requires strict measures to control costs, we are fortunate the
revenues arriving from new development projects are protecting Unified Government programs and

services from even more severe reductions. They are offsetting the loss of other revenues caused by a
slowly recovering economy and actions by the Kansas Legislature. The financial picture is expected to
continue improving as we move closer to the 2015-2017 budgets. Imagine a path where the budget can
afford to reduce property taxes, adequately compensate employees, increase the scope of capital
improvements, better fund services and begin restoring fund balances.

The Proposed 2014 Budget represents a crossroads for the Unified Government. Where do we go from
here? One financial path would take a more conservative, even dismal view of economic conditions
and dictate more drastic budget cuts. Another path would take an overly optimistic view of the new
revenues which will come when the Village West STAR Bonds are retired and millions in sales tax
dollars return to the Unified Government. The 2014 Proposed Budget represents a responsible middle
path which takes a prudent, reasonable and practical approach to dealing with the current financial
situation, yet anticipates the benefits of increasing revenues. This budget recommends the Unified
Government Commission adopt a formula for allocating the new revenues from pay-off of the STAR
Bonds, expected increased revenues from the Hollywood Casino and other new development projects
on the way. Setting a course for how those new dollars will be spent will provide for more budget
certainty and better planning for community needs.

The 2014 Proposed Budget remains closely tied to the Strategic Goals and Budget Policy Guidelines
adopted by the Mayor and Board of Commissioners. It deals with sizeable budget shortfalls, while
recommending a path to responsibly use increased revenues we know are coming in 2015-2017.
Long Range Budget Goals
Reducing property tax rates over the near future term through incremental and sustainable
reductions which will bring the Unified Government tax rates to competitive levels with other
Kansas communities.
Restoring fund balances to reach the Unified Government’s stated financial objectives and
maintain strong credit ratings.
Reducing debt by funding more annual projects on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Restoring money borrowed from the Environmental Trust Fund and Health Insurance Fund on
an incremental basis over the next 5-7 years.

Where Have We Been?
Before outlining a path for the future, it is important to know where we’ve been. The global recession
which started in 2008 caused a collapse of the housing market, an increase in foreclosures, a decrease
in home sales, a dramatic drop in the assessed values of property and a severe decline in property tax
revenues in Wyandotte County. Unemployment and slowed consumer spending created a serious drop
in sales tax collections. And the Kansas Legislature, facing its own budget crisis, slashed hundreds of
millions of dollars in promised local government funding and passed laws which significantly eroded the
tax base.

Major Revenue Losses
Machinery and Equipment Tax: In 2006, the Kansas Legislature repealed the property tax on
commercial and industrial machinery and equipment. Since 2006, Wyandotte County has lost
$115-million in assessed value from machinery and equipment, reducing Unified Government
property tax revenues by more than $35-million. The decision to eliminate the machinery and
equipment tax, while positive for business, continues to take a devastating toll on Unified
Government revenues
Local Ad Valorem Tax Reduction Fund: Cancellation of this longtime partnership between the
State of Kansas and local governments in 2003 continues to cost the Unified Government more
than $3-million a year in what had been steady, reliable funding intended to reduce local
property taxes. The program had been in place since 1937 and provided a dollar for dollar
reduction in property tax revenues. The cumulative impact of the Kansas Legislature to not fund
the LAVTR program has cost the Unified Government at least $30-million in revenue.
Assessed Value Loss: Wyandotte County had experienced nearly 20 years of steady growth in
assessed valuations. The higher property is valued, the lower the tax rate can be to generate
the same revenue. The recession of 2008 blocked that growth in property values. Had the
recession and repeal of the machinery and equipment tax not stopped the trend in valuation
growth, the Unified Government would have collected an additional $59-million in actual tax
revenue between 2008 and 2013.
Community Development Block Grants: This important Federal program funds beneficial
neighborhood improvement and housing programs in KCK. Congress has routinely reduced the
annual funding for this national program, which means the Unified Government receives less
money for these programs.

Property Tax Revenues

Unfunded Federal and State Mandates
A significant share of the taxes paid by Wyandotte County residents is because of unfunded mandates
and policies imposed by the Federal government and State of Kansas. These mandates push the
property tax rate higher than it otherwise would need to be. But these mandates from Federal agencies
and funding decisions by the Kansas Legislature must be met.

Americans with Disabilities Act: The Federal government has ordered the Unified Government
to spend millions of dollars upgrading facilities and making other improvements to better
accommodate citizens with physical disabilities. The Unified Government is working to meet
these mandates.
Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO): The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered the
Unified Government to make improvements to aging sewer lines which no longer meet
environmental standards. The improvements mandated by the EPA will cost KCK residents
hundreds of millions of dollars. The Unified Government aggressively worked to minimize the
financial impact on residents by negotiating with the EPA and Federal Justice Department for a
longer period of time to come into compliance, but the costs will still be significant.
KPERS: The Kansas Public Employees Retirement System and the Kansas Police and Fire
Retirement Fund has changed the rules for funding the programs at a significant cost to the
Unified Government and other local governments. The cost of meeting the obligations to retiring
employees is costing the Unified Government hundreds of thousands of dollars in the short
term.

Budget Response to Recession 2007-2012
While revenues evaporated in the wake of the recession, demands for Unified Government services
continued and in many cases increased. The Unified Government managed these major revenue
shortfalls by adopting a series of difficult budget policies over the past several years:

Cut spending by millions of dollars;
Reduced the non-Public Safety workforce;
Cut department operating budgets;
Imposed employee furloughs;
Froze salaries with no pay raises for four years;
Enacted hiring freezes;
Dramatically reduced capital improvement projects and equipment purchases;
Drew on cash reserves, reducing ending fund balances;

Where Are We Now?
The need for programs and services are more than the Unified Government can afford in 2014.
Residential and commercial real property is a major revenue component of property taxes. Assessed
value of real property in Wyandotte County has plummeted since 2008 when the recession began.

For residential parcels, almost 97% of all parcels in the county lost value during this period, meaning
the actual tax dollars paid on homes decreased. The assessed value of all taxable property in
Wyandotte County dropped from an all time high of $1.2-billion in 2008 to $1.09-billion in 2013. This
loss of almost $200-million in value reduced property tax collections significantly..

Overall assessed value of real property in Wyandotte County is stabilizing after those several years of
substantial declines. But assessed valuation increased only 0.4% over last year. The number of
building permits for residential housing is improved over the past several years, but still falls far short of
pre-recession levels.

General sales tax revenues supporting the 2014 budget are projected to show improvement and are
expected to increase. The dedicated Public Safety and Community Infrastructure sales tax, approved
by voters in 2010, is essential in maintaining public safety positions and is generating dollars to fund
construction of sidewalks, curbs and other neighborhood improvements. Sales tax collected in Village
West remains strong and retirement of all the STAR Bonds issued to develop the area is projected in
2017.

The opening of the Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway is bringing new dollars into the community
and Unified Government. The casino is generating gaming revenues and property taxes. The Unified
Government Commission has adopted a policy of budgeting those dollars conservatively until a more
solid financial track record is established.

In addition to property taxes, state law requires 3% of gaming revenues go to local governments and is
to be divided with 1.5% earmarked for the County Government in which the casino is located and 1.5%
earmarked for the City Government in which the casino is located. A landmark revenue sharing
agreement between Bonner Springs, Edwardsville and KCK further divides that 1.5% of City
Government revenue, with KCK receiving .75% and the other 2 cities sharing the remaining .75%.

In addition, the development agreement negotiated between the Unified Government and Hollywood
Casino calls for the casino to dedicate $500,000 annually for community and charitable contributions
and a $100,000 allocation for park projects. The casino will also pay an additional 1% of casino
revenues to the Unified Government in accordance with the terms of the development agreement.

Demands on Unified Government Revenues
While new revenues are being collected, the demand for those dollars, many uncontrollable, are having
an impact.
A series of late season major snowstorms.
The price of gasoline and diesel fuel.
The cost of automotive parts to keep an aging fleet of vehicles, from police cars to dump trucks,
running and safe increased sharply.
Increased costs for the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System and Kansas Police and
Fire Retirement Fund.
Decisions by the Kansas Legislature to shift the cost of many State services to local
governments.
Other demands for Unified Government tax dollars are controllable, but many of these expenditures are
included in the annual budget to meet the needs of the community and wishes of its citizens.

The Importance of Public Safety
Citizen surveys show Fire and Police services are the top priority for our citizens and the Unified
Government Commission has made Public Safety its top budget priority. Citizens confirmed their
commitment to high quality Public Safety by overwhelmingly approving a special sales tax in 2010 to
support it. The results of this investment has produced the best Fire Department and Emergency
Medical Service response times in the Kansas City metro and the KCK crime rate is at the lowest point
in four decades.

Achieving those outcomes is costly. In 2013, Public Safety consumes 45% of the total Unified
Government budget, with costs continuing to rise. Despite the recession, Unified Government spending
on the Police, Fire and Sheriff Departments increased $15-million from 2007-2012. During the same
period, spending on other Unified Government departments went down $3-million.

The ranks of the KCK Police Department and KCK Fire Department have grown, even during the years
of hiring and pay freezes. This year more than 50 Police Officers, Firefighters and Sheriff’s Deputies
are being hired. The number of Public Safety employees constitutes 44% of the total Unified
Government workforce.
The community is paying for more Police Officers, Firefighters and Sheriff’s Deputies than it has ever
had, yet overtime for both Public Safety is running in excess of a million dollars a year. The expense of
our current level of Public Safety services makes it difficult to meet other community needs and carry
out other Commission goals.

The Proposed 2014 Budget recommends steps to keep Public Safety the top priority of the Unified
Government, while balancing the expenses so other programs, services and needs can still be met.
Those steps include:

A Comprehensive Fire/Emergency Medical Services Master Plan through a joint UnionManagement process. Factors to be considered in the analysis and development of the master
plan will include, but not be limited to: station locations, including potential new stations;
renovation and expansion and/or closure of existing stations; deployment of manpower and
apparatus; response times; and safety of fire personnel.
Implementing measures to reduce Public Safety overtime.
Declining the latest Department of Justice grant if it is awarded because the new Police Officers
hired with those Federal dollars will later have to be paid for with local tax dollars.

Holding off Phase Two of the Sheriff’s Department project to install double bunks in Wyandotte
County Jail cells. Phase One of the double bunking project is in place and seems to be
successful in reducing the high costs of “farming-out” prisoners to other jails to prevent
overcrowding. Delaying implementation of Phase Two will allow more time to confirm the
financial savings of double bunking and save the cost of physically installing the bunks. It will
also allow time for a facilities study to determine if the opening of a Juvenile Detention Facility is
a better, less costly, option than keeping juvenile offenders in the Wyandotte County Jail.
And so, while Public Safety remains a top priority, we must work to contain expenses across all Unified
Government operations.

Improved Delinquent Tax Collection Efforts
Despite budget gaps and federal cuts, the demand for services is at an all-time high. The burden of
paying for all of the services the community needs and desires should be carried by all citizens and
businesses who use them. Unfortunately, that is not the case. But the Unified Government is steppingup efforts to collect from taxpayers who dodge their civic duty to pay for their share of the services. The
Unified Government has launched a more coordinated, integrated approach to collect money it is
already owed.

Delinquent tax collection efforts are producing significant returns. Last year, the Unified Government
Commission approved an effective new measure to stop the abuses by taxpayers who work the system
to avoid paying their taxes on time. The change now requires any delinquent payment be applied to the
most recent delinquent year instead of the oldest year. The change is ending the practice of paying only
the oldest year of delinquent tax -- just enough to keep the property out of a tax sale -- but continues a
never-ending two year rolling debt on the most recent delinquent tax years.

As a result of this new policy and improved efforts to market delinquent properties, the most recent tax
sale in May 2013 produced $3-million in revenues shared among the Unified Government, public
school districts, community college and other taxing jurisdictions.
.
The Kansas Legislature approved a law this year which allows counties to increase the fee charged to
publish the required list of delinquent properties every year. The current fee of $15 for publishing each
listing can now be raised to $30 to cover the cost of publication and other expenses associated with
delinquent properties. Increasing the fee is a policy decision for the Commission.

The Unified Government uses the State of Kansas Debt Set-Off Program in which the Kansas
Department of Revenue garnishes money from people who receive any kind of payment from the State,

but who also owe a debt to the Unified Government. The State keeps 17% of the amount collected as
an administrative fee. A proposal as part of this budget calls for the Commission to adopt a policy
declaring the 17% collection fee as part of the debt owed. The State will still keep its 17% fee, but the
change means the UG will get the full amount of the debt owed.

Where Do We Go From Here?
The 2014 Proposed Budget recommends a path to confront the difficult budget challenges facing the
Unified Government next year while setting a course for the near future when increased revenues will
be arriving. It represents a reasonable, balanced approach following the strategic goals and budget
guidelines endorsed by the Unified Government Commission.

Proposed 2014 Budget In Brief
Holds the Unified Government tax rate at the current level of 81.6 mills
.
The Proposed 2014 Unified Government Budget recommends total expenditures of
$296.8-million for 2014. The City general fund is budgeted at $136.9-million. The County
general fund is proposed at $53-million.

The 2014 Proposed Budget shows increased spending over the 2013 budget for several
reasons. $7-million of the increase isn’t really an increase at all, but simply a change in

accounting procedures. The annual budget now shows expenses and revenues from special
development projects such as Prescott Plaza, Wyandotte Plaza and STAR Bond funded
projects. While it increases the total amount of the budget, the revenues balance with the
expenses, so it is not an increase in spending, simply a different way of displaying the numbers.
Other reasons for the larger budget total are due to additional costs required by the Kansas
Public Employees Retirement System and Kansas Police and Fire Retirement Fund; money
budgeted for employee pay bonuses; and an increase in trash collection costs.

The Unified Government receives only 47% of the total tax bill paid by a Wyandotte County
resident. Public schools, the Kansas City Kansas Community College, KCK Public Library and
State of Kansas make up the largest portion of the tax bill-- about 53%. The current property
rate is still much lower than before the Unified Government was created. In 1997 it was was 97
mills. Now it’s 81.6 mills. That’s 16% less than a decade and a half ago.

Property tax revenues represent 27% of Unified Government revenues.
Sales tax revenues make-up 15% of the Unified Government budget.
Franchise fees account for 13% of Unified Government revenues.

Charges for service represent 17% of Unified Government revenue.
Revenue from gasoline tax, fines/fees, grants and other sources make-up the rest.
The 2014 Proposed Budget preserves fund balances at the same level as the 2013 approved
budget.

The proposed budget is built on the foundation of the goals and budget policy guidelines
adopted by the Unified Government Commission as well as comments gathered from citizens in
public hearings and an on-line budget survey.

Recommended Budget Measures
A series of hard measures had to be taken to ensure the budget balances expenses with revenues.
Generally reduces department operating budgets by 5%.
Reduces the budget for capital projects & equipment.
Holds the line on debt funded activity.
Resumes efforts to reduce overall staffing through attrition.
Reduces overtime.
Transfers $3-million from the Water Pollution Control Enterprise Fund to the City General Fund.
This is a loan which will be repaid.

The Department of Justice grant will not be accepted if awarded.
The KCK Fire Department Cadet Program is not funded in 2014.
The KCK Recycling Center does not play the important role it once did because residents are
now provided curbside recycling services as part of their weekly trash pick-up and private
companies are taking on the recycling of glass. The 2014 Proposed Budget closes the
Recycling Center.
Provides funding for 2% pay bonuses for personnel effective July 1, 2014
Funding for several community organizations and programs is not built into the 2014 proposed
budget, including: two proposed offender re-entry programs and additional funding for the
Wyandotte Economic Development Council.
Last year the Unified Government called for eliminating the Board of Public Utilities Payment-inlieu-of-taxes (PILOT) fee from customer bills in 2014. Eliminating the PILOT follows the more
traditional practice used by many municipal utilities. In those cases the utility simply transfers
revenues to the city general fund instead of adding the revenues to the bill in what appears to
be a separate or additional charge. The Unified Government and Board of Public Utilities were
moving in that direction, but at the request of the BPU board—stated and voted on in official
resolution—the BPU is asking the PILOT fee not be eliminated at this time.
Under state law, a franchise or PILOT fee is required to be not less than 5% and no more than
15%. The 2014 budget recommends the PILOT be set at 11.9% beginning January 1, 2014.
This is a 1% increase over the current rate, but still lower than the 12.8% rate set two years ago.
Trash collection fees will increase $1.50 a month due to contract increases.
Sanitary sewer fees will increase 5% due to mandates from the Federal government.
These measures, while difficult, are necessary to balance expenses with available revenues. These
steps have been calculated in the 2014 Proposed Budget.

Recommended Improvements and Enhancements
The Proposed 2014 Budget does offer a number of service improvements and enhancements.
Includes funding for upgrades to the 311 Call Center which will allow improved operation of the
system.
The budget allocates $50,000 for the broadcasting and taped replay of Unified Government
Commission meetings on UGTV beginning July 1, 2014.
Adds $400,000 to increase the number of streets which can be resurfaced.
Includes funding for operation of the new Piper Community Center.

Increases UG Transit funding by $550,000 in 2013 and $450,000 in 2014.
Continues the waiver of building fees for new home construction. From August 2012 through the
end of 2013, the Unified Government is waiving all building permit fees, inspection fees and
sewer connection fees for new single family home construction. Wyandotte County is now 5th in
the Kansas City metro for issuance of new home permits. It is recommended the waiver of fees
continue in 2014.
The Land Bank offers a promising opportunity to produce revenue and deal with the problems
caused by abandoned properties. This budget proposes moving the Unified Government Land
Bank into the Economic Development Department and creating a program to aggressively
market vacant land and abandoned properties to investors, developers and others.
Neighborhood Business Revitalization organizations play an important role the economic health
and improvement of our many neighborhoods. The 2014 Budget proposes moving
administration of the NBR program into the Neighborhood Resource Center and increasing total
funding by $35,000--- that’s an additional $5,000 for each NBR.
Compensation and Benefits Study of non-union employee ranks to determine how Unified
Government employee pay compares with other local governments and the private sector
workforce.
A Comprehensive Fire/Emergency Medical Services Master Plan through a joint UnionManagement process. Factors to be considered in the analysis and development of the master
plan will include, but not be limited to: station locations, including potential new stations;
renovation and expansion and/or closure of existing stations; deployment of manpower and
apparatus; response times; and safety of fire personnel.
New Sheriff’s Deputies hired with federal grant dollars to monitor offenders and transport
prisoners.
The 2014 Budget picks-up the cost of 20 firefighters previously paid with federal grant dollars.
Adds a position to review Emergency Medical Service billings and accounts. The cost of this
position is expected to be offset by increased collections.
Expands use of Customer Satisfaction Surveys.

Planning for New Revenues
The Unified Government will begin reaping the full financial benefits of the Village West development in
the next few years. In 2015, the Hollywood Casino will be paying an additional 1% of gaming revenues
to the Unified Government and the STAR Bonds issued to build the Village West development will be
paid off in 2017.

The 2014 Proposed Budget recommends a path for determining how those revenues should be used.
It is recommended a portion of the new revenues be used for reduction of Unified Government property
taxes. Another portion of the new revenues should be earmarked to repay money borrowed from the
Environmental Trust Fund, Health Insurance Trust Fund and Water Pollution Control Enterprise Fund.
And finally, a share of the new revenues should be used to meet long neglected needs of the Unified
Government organization, including employee compensation, repair of facilities and the hiring of
needed employees, including planning, engineering and economic development staff to ensure the
Unified Government is able to meet the demands of new growth.

The Village West development has been a game changer for Wyandotte County. It brings millions of
tourists, shoppers and dollars to our community every year. Village West accounts for more than $10million a year in property tax revenues and generates millions more in sales taxes which will flow to the
Unified Government when the STAR Bonds are retired in 2017.

Many of the streets in Village West are 15 years old and starting to show their age. Other infrastructure
improvements will also be needed. It is critical to maintain the public infrastructure and viability of this
successful, major community asset.

While reinvestment in Village West is necessary, maintenance and improvements in Village West
should be paid for with revenues generated by Village West. The 2014 Proposed Budget recommends
establishment of a Community Improvement District or Transportation Development District to fund
needed repairs and improvements to Village West. This can be done by adding a small increment of
sales tax to purchases in the area.

Setting a course for how those new dollars will be spent will provide for more budget certainty and
better planning for community needs.

Conclusion
The Proposed 2014 Unified Government Budget asks--- and answers —the question, “Where Do We
Go From Here,” both as an organization and community. Just like the citizens we serve, the Unified
Government must live within its financial means. The challenge is finding the proper balance between
the services citizens need and want and the community’s ability -- and willingness -- to pay for them.
The 2014 Proposed Budget represents a responsible middle path which takes a prudent, practical
approach to dealing with the current financial situation, yet anticipates the benefits of increasing
revenues.

VISION STATEMENT
Wyandotte County is an urban
community with a small town feel
where people live in close knit,
diverse, safe neighborhoods for life.

Preface - 2

VALUES STATEMENT
Values are core beliefs or principles that guide an organization. Determining those common values are critical in coming together
around a set of goals. At its November 5, 2011 workshop, the governing reached consensus on the following core values.

ROLE OF GOVERNMENT

 The role of the Unified Government is to provide only core services.
 The role of the Unified Government is to provide core services as well as to work with organizations in the community to solve
community-wide problems.

FINANCIAL RESOURCES

 Capital improvement tax dollars should be strategically invested to support the community vision.
 The primary goal of the Unified Government should be to offer core services as efficiently as possible.
 The Unified Government recognizes that to provide its core services in an era of declining revenues and increased costs,
taxes might have to increase.
 Because the largest expense in the Unified Government is related to employee pay and benefits, the Board recognizes that
reduction in those areas might be necessary to minimize the tax burden.
 The Unified Government should implement a tax structure that does not overburden anyone.

EFFECTIVENESS

 Investments must be made that have the most impact for the dollars spent.

EQUITY/FAIRNESS

 Resources should be allocated equitably across the eight commission districts.
 The Board should consider the investment benefits and impacts of its decisions on all population groups within the community.
 All employees should be treated in a fair manner in accruing pay and benefits.

INNOVATION/PLANNING

 The Board will strive to make decisions based upon consensus on vision and goals.
 The Unified Government should take risks on new ideas or ways of doing things, even if failure is possible.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT

 The Unified Government should continue to incent development and redevelopment to increase revenues over the long term.

PARTNERSHIPS

 The Unified Government should strengthen partnerships with community organizations to achieve community goals.

PUBLIC EDUCATION
 The public perception should be that the Unified Government is fair and decision-making is open and influenced by public
input.
 The public should realize a direct benefit from the investments made.
 The public should be consulted about priorities within the community.
 The Unified Government should promote understanding of how local government services are funded.

Preface - 5

BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
POLICY GUIDANCE FOR
2013 AMENDED AND 2014 PROPOSED BUDGET
Through the Strategic Planning Process, the Board of Commissioners has developed
the following policy guidance for the preparation of the 2013 Budget:

REDUCE PROPERTY TAX RATE
Property tax rates must be reduced over the near future term through incremental and
sustainable reductions, eventually bringing Unified Government rates to competitive
levels with other Kansas communities. In order to reach this goal maintaining the
current property rate for 2013 is acceptable.

RESTORE FUND BALANCES
Reach the government's stated financial objectives, and maintain strong credit ratings.

REDUCE DEBT
Funding annual projects on a pay-as-you go basis is a long-term budget objective.

ADDRESS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION ISSUES
Address across the board for both employees represented by organized labor and nonunion employees.

MAINTAIN CORE SERVICES AT ADEQUATE LEVELS
These services should be provided in the most efficient and effective manner possible.

SHIFT RESOURCES TO MATCH COMMISSION PRIORITIES
Neither broad service reductions nor widespread employee reductions are acceptable in
the 2013 Budget. Although shifts of personnel resources to match Commission priorities
such as Weed Abatement in 2012 and Code Enforcement in 2013 are anticipated.

BUDGET CASINO REVENUES
Conservatively until definite revenue trends emerge.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMISSION NEIGHBORHOOD INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM
Through planning and design in 2012 and into construction phase in 2013 is a priority.

RESTORE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS
On an incremental basis over the next 5-7 years.

ANALYZE FUNDING FOR OUTSIDE AGENCIES
Adjust to appropriate levels.

HISTORY
Wyandotte County was organized on
January 29, 1859. The county contains the
cities of Bonner Springs, Edwardsville,
Kansas City and Lake Quivira (part), and
was named for the Wyandot Indians
(various spellings).
The Wyandot Indians arrived in the
area from Ohio in 1843. They were
responsible for the early cultivation of the
land, barn building, planting of orchards,
and
road
building.
The
Wyandot
Constitutional Convention met on July 5,
1859, remained in session twenty-one
days, and at the close gave Kansas a new constitution. This constitution was approved
by the people on October 4, 1859. The White Church in Wyandot was supposedly
founded in 1832. The first county fair was held in 1863 on the levee in Wyandot. The
first school district was organized in 1867 in the city of Wyandot.

UNIFIED STORY
County citizens set the stage for today’s economic development successes in
1997 when they overwhelmingly agreed to consolidate Wyandotte County and City of
Kansas City, Kansas governments on April 1, 1997. The community was suffering from
years of economic hardships and decline. Citizens were ready for a rebirth. The new
form of government was the beginning of the landmark renaissance in the community.
The fresh political dynamic created by consolidation allowed the community to
take new, bold approaches to many issues, including economic development. Soon
after the Unified Government was launched, the economic development opportunity of a
lifetime landed in Wyandotte County. The Kansas Speedway and Village West
developments are the most successful economic developments ever built in the State of
Kansas, turning mostly undeveloped land into one of the most popular tourist, shopping
and entertainment attractions in the Midwest.

Kansas City was once the second largest meat packing industry in the world, second
only to Chicago. The opening of the Kansas City Stockyards by the railroads catapulted
the city into an important shipping point for many goods and services.
Today, the city has diversified into a transportation, medical, and manufacturing center.
International trade is emerging as an important inter-jurisdictional issue in the Midwest
region. The 1998 Mid-Continent TradeWay Study reinforced this reality. This study
found that a significant amount of international cargo is already processed in or passes
through the Kansas City region. The principal industrial activity in Wyandotte County
and Kansas City, Kansas involves:
•

Automobile Manufacturing & Distribution

•

Meat Processing

•

Railroads

•

Bakery Products

•

Agriculture

WHAT IS THE BUDGET?
Budgeting is not a “clerical” process nor is it an exercise in “counting the beans –
where they come from and where they go.” The National Advisory Council on State and
Local Budgeting (NACSLB) calls the budget document “arguably the single most
important document prepared by governments”. It’s one of the single-most
important documents produced each year. It is a policy document, financial plan,
operations guide, and communications tool all rolled into one. It shares what money is
available, where it goes, what services are provided and at what costs. The Unified
Government’s budget has four main functions. It is a Policy Document, a Financial Plan,
an Operations Guide, and a Means of Communication.
Policy Document: This is the most significant function of the budget document. In its
broad context, it pertains to long-term, organization-wide policies that establish broad
goals, direct how and where resources are spent, and establish a framework for
providing and funding services. As a Policy Document, the budget also describes the
County's short-term financial and operational policies which influence the budget
development process for the upcoming year, for example: the goals and objectives of
the County's departments, new programs, staffing requirements, etc. Finally, the policy
function articulates the most significant choices and decisions regarding key issues,
priorities, ramifications and how these have changed from the current year.
Financial Plan: As a financial planning tool, the budget provides an explanation of the
County's financial structure; descriptions of its funds; summaries of major revenues and
expenditures; narratives for the major revenue sources; and assumptions associated
with revenue estimates and trends. The budget provides a comprehensive discussion of
capital projects and their impact on the operating budget, includes financial data and
narrative on current debt levels and debt limits, and addresses the potential effect of
existing debt levels on the future operations of the County.
Operations Guide: The budget document is designed to be a readable guide to the
County's varied activities and services. It is a valuable resource which includes
summary tables of personnel and positions, community statistical information,
measurements of performance, and other information often referred to by department
directors, managers, and the citizens.
Communications Device: To be an effective communication tool, the budget must be
able to clearly explain significant budgetary issues, trends, and priorities; short-term and
long-term financial strategies; capital improvement plans; and significant budgetary
impacts to elected officials, department heads and their staff, and to the citizens for
whom they work. The Unified Government is has been striving over the past several
years to provide the most comprehensive, yet “readable” and usable document
possible. The following section describes the budget process.

Preface - 22

UNDERSTANDING THE BUDGET DOCUMENT
The budget document is separated in thirteen separate sections. These include:
1. Highlights and Issues
2. Budget Overview
3. Office of the Mayor/CEO
4. Board of Commissioners
5. Administration
6. Public Safety
7. Judicial Services
8. Community Services
9. Public Works
10. Other Programs
11. CMIP Projects
12. CMIP Equipment
13. Appendix
Highlights and Issues
The budget document begins with the annual budget message from the County
Administrator. This letter provides an overview of the budget and signals the direction of
the Unified Government for the next fiscal year. In addition, there is a copy of the
County Administrator’s PowerPoint presentation given to the Mayor and Commissioners
highlighting the key budget points.
Budget Overview
This section consists of an overview of the budget process. Following this is a complete
summary of revenues and expenditures by fund.
Departmental Sections (Office of the Mayor/CEO, Board of Commissioners,
Administration, Public Safety, Judicial Services, Community Services, Public Works, &
Other Programs)
Within these sections, each department’s budget is presented. Every department
provides a departmental overview, identifies important issues, highlights key
accomplishments and outcomes, and outlines new initiatives. The department expense
summary is succeeded by a department narrative.
Further, for those departments with individual divisions, a budget breakdown by division
is provided. Each division offers an overview, identifies important issues, highlights key
accomplishments and outcomes, and outlines new initiatives. Lastly, a division expense
summary is also presented.

Preface - 23

*For an example of a departmental budget and explanation, see the pages immediately
following this summary.
CMIP Projects
Outlined in the Capital Maintenance Improvement Program (CMIP) section, consists a
list of projects scheduled to take place over the next five years within each department.
For each project, the total cost is shown, which year the cost will occur, and which fund
will finance the task.
CMIP Equipment
This section lists all equipment scheduled to be acquired over the next five years within
each department. The total cost is shown, which year the cost will occur, and which
fund will finance the acquisition.

BUDGET PROCESS OVERVIEW
Municipal governments across the country are charged with the responsibility of
targeting limited revenues and scarce resources to viable and productive services. This
places the governmental body in the critical position of balancing public interests with
public expectations.
The County Administrator is charged with the responsibility of developing an annual
operating and capital program budget which serves a variety of functions. First, it acts
as a communication device to present the Board of Commissioners financial, strategic,
operation and policy goals. Second, it serves as a policy document to outline how funds
will be spent. Third, it outlines a financial plan that demonstrates a multi-year focus.
Finally, it establishes an operations guide or roadmap for managers and department
heads on issues surrounding personnel levels, performance targets and reorganization
plans.
The Unified Government budget operates on a cash basis, calendar year from January
1 through December 31. However, adoption of the Annual Operating and Capital
Budget takes place no later than August 25th of the prior year, as stipulated by Kansas
State Law. In order to meet the August deadline, the annual budget process begins in
February. This ensures that there is adequate time set aside for a comprehensive
review and analysis of departmental requests. A copy of the 2011 calendar is included
in this document.
The “Budget Cycle” has four phases: DEPARTMENTAL SUBMISSION;
CONSOLIDATION AND PREPARATION; REVIEW, REVISION AND ADOPTION; AND
IMPLEMENTATION. Each phase of the cycle is described as follows:
Phase 1: Departmental Submission:
The budget process begins with a Senior Managers Meeting and an orientation
on the process, goals and expectations by the County Administrator at the end of
the year.
Equipped with the updated schedules and directions the Departments prepare
Capital Maintenance and Improvement Project (CMIP) Request, Operating
Budgets and New Budget Initiatives.
Submissions include request for the following calendar year and revisions to the
current year. (For example: The 2011 process included CMIP requests for 2011
thru 2016, Operating funds for 2012 and to revise 2011.

Preface - 30

Phase 2: Consolidation and Preparation:
Consolidation and Preparation is a function of the Budget Department and
Administrator’s Office. As the deadlines for each type of submission approach
Budget staff work closely with the departments to insure that accurate and
complete requests are submitted with adequate descriptions and justifications
that allow a novice reader to understand the request.
The CMIP requests are gathered and batched first so that the Work Group can
begin review of all the submissions in a very involved effort to rank and prioritize
the requests. The review begins in February and consumes the entire month.
Finally the Operating Budgets are submitted. That includes a line by line
submission in every category. Departments may make zero sum changes to
supplies and services but genuine increases, new positions or programs must be
submitted in a format very similar to the CMIP process, with detailed descriptions
and justifications.
After review of the Budget Initiatives the recommended submissions are
compiled with the CMIP projects and a budget document is prepared. That Draft
is the Administrator’s recommended Budget to the Board of Commissioners.
Phase 3: The Review, Revision and Adoption:
The Review, Revision and Adoption process begins with Administrator’s Draft
Recommendation. The Commission begins their review with a series of Budget
Workshops. Through the Workshop process, the Commission reviews the
submissions and adds, removes, or modifies items as they shape the budget to
meet their goals for the planned Mill Levy Rate. This is an interactive process
open to the public that engages the Administrator, Departments, the public and
the Commission.
Through the process staff will address questions, concerns, and directives of the
Commission until a final budget is reached that meets the Mill Levy target, that
the majority of commissioners can agree upon.
Traditionally the Commission completes the process with one or more public
hearings before approving a final Budget before the August 15th state deadline.
Once approved the final Budget Document will be printed and submitted to the
State by the UG Clerk.
Phase 4: Implementation:
The Implementation process happens as various points for the items approved
through the Budget Cycle. Re-appropriations from the previous year are
generally addressed in the spring and that money is immediately made available
to the departments immediately after the requests are approved.

Preface - 31

Items for the revised current year are adjusted by the Budget Office in
September, after the approval process is completed. At that same time the
Departments are provided with copies of the State Documents, the Annual
Operating Budget for the coming year, the CMIP Budget for the next 5 years and
the line items and revenue details that support the finished documents.
The Implementation process includes year round monitoring of the budget,
adjustments, and data collection, including Performance Measures. The Budget
Office continues to compile this data and report to the Administrator’s Office. This
data is used to help direct the Budget Cycle for the next year.

BUDGET CONTROL SYSTEM
The Unified Government’s budgeting system is a program based and line item
budgeting system process. Departments prepare program operating and capital
budgets at a detailed object expense level.
All Unified Government Tax Levy Funds are required to balance according to Kansas
Stated Statute (K.S.A 79-2967).
The legal level of control is established at the fund level by State statutes which also
permit the transfer of budgeted amounts from one object code or purpose to another
within the same fund. However funds cannot be transferred between departments
without obtaining approval from administration.
The Unified Government further controls spending by requiring that no expenditures be
committed that would exceed the amount appropriated for the spending category (eg
Personnel Services Commodities Capital) without the department first obtaining
approval.
The following types of budget transfers require department director approval and
additional approval by the County Administrator’s Office:
•
•
•
•

An appropriation of contingency funds.
An appropriation of reserve funds.
Transfers that move funds between operating and capital budgets.
Transfers within a fund that are equal to or greater than $10,000.

The following actions require budget director’s approval before execution:
•
•

Pre Bid Contracts
Capital Project Contracts

Preface - 32

•
•

Capital Equipment Purchases
Changing status of an unfunded personnel position to funded or creation of a
new personnel position.

The following budgetary controls have been implemented and will be adhered to by all
departments and divisions:
•
•
•

Transfers from the salary accounts require department director, chief financial
officer, and County Administrator’s Office approvals.
Funds may be transferred between other accounts with department director
approval.
Funds may be transferred from one division to another division with both
divisions being in the same fund with department director and the transferring
division manager approvals.

BUDGET AMENDMENTS
Budget Amendments require formal approval of the Commission as allowed by State
Statute. An Amendment may only be made for previously unbudgeted increases in the
revenue other than ad valorem taxes. The UG may authorize an amendment of any
current fiscal year budget, at the fund level, for the current fiscal year operating budget.
It is the policy of the UG to amend a fund’s budget for emergencies, federal and state
mandates, or other circumstances which could not be anticipated, and only if sufficient
funds are available; a budget may not be amended simply because additional revenues
become available. If unexpected or unfunded expenditures must be made, department
directors are expected to manage their available resources and reevaluate priorities
before requesting a budget amendment.
The Chief Financial Officer submits to the Commission a request to amend the budget.
The request contains explanations written by the director(s) of the department(s)
needing additional funds. The request also includes a proposal for financing the
additional expenditures. To do this a notice of public hearing to amend the budget must
be published in the local newspaper. At least ten days after the publication the hearing
may be held and the governing body may amend the budget at that time.

The City General Fund is the principal operating account of Kansas City, KS. Revenue is received from
taxes, fees, intergovernmental revenue, charges for services, and other sources. The General Fund is
used to support general operations including Police, Fire, Municipal Court, Public Works, general services
functions, and administrative programs. General Fund revenues are also used to finance the purchase of

Note: The increase in debt service in the 2013 amended and 2014 budgets is attributed to the budgeting of annual
appropriation STAR Bond and Transportation Development District debt payments. This debt expense is offset by a
corresponding revenue increase. Bond counsel and the government’s external auditor recommended this change.

County Initiative for Funding Infrastructure Fund
As authorized by KSA 19-120 this is a multi-year capital improvement fund. Any county which has
approved a multi-year capital improvement plan may create such a fund to assist in the funding of capital
improvement projects. This fund may provide for the budgeted transfer of moneys from other county
funds lawfully available for improvement purposes.
This fund uses tax levy previously required by the County Bond and Interest fund to finance capital
improvement projects in Kansas City, Bonner Springs and Edwardsville. In 2009 this fund was
suspended. However, this budget reflects the expenditure of prior-year tax delinquent revenue received
by the fund.

2013 AMENDED AND 2014 OPERATING BUDGET
FUND SUMMARY
Elections Levy Fund
The Elections Levy Fund is used to account for the revenues and expenses related to communitywide
elections in Wyandotte County. Revenue is used by the Election Commissioner's Office to conduct and
oversee all elections: national, state, county, city, community college, school districts, drainage districts,
and special elections. Revenues collected to fund these activities are generated from ad valorem
property taxes and the local ad valorem tax reduction from the State of Kansas.
This fund was established by KSA 19-3435a, 25-2201a, and 39-417. The statutes state that any county
having an election commissioner is authorized to make a tax levy in each year, in such amount as may be
necessary in order to provide the necessary funding for the payment of the salaries and expenses of the
office of the election commissioner and election expenses. The county may make a tax levy on the
taxable tangible property in the county in an amount not greater than the amount necessary to pay the
direct expense of elections which the county is required to pay.

Department Overview
County Appraiser
Department Overview:
The Appraiser’s Office discovers, inspects, evaluates and assigns a market or appraised value and
classification to all taxable and exempt property in the county and otherwise implements all laws, including
administrative rules and regulations set by the State Property Valuation Division. The resulting taxable
assessed values become the total tax base of the county. The Appraiser’s Office defends those values
when they are appealed and adjusts them, if necessary. The County Appraiser also administers all matters
relating to the exemption of property and the filing of tax grievances by taxpayers.
Important Issues:
 Hire and retain qualified appraisers to comply with State requirement that appraisers have a
minimum of one year’s experience in order to set values.
 Continue to implement cost-effective and customer-friendly initiatives that allow us to comply with
statutes and communicate with the public via the web or public information broadcasts.
 Continue funding system enhancements to our real estate tracking and appraisal software (Orion)
and personal property tracking and valuation software (TAS) installed in 2008.
 Compliance with USPAP standards and promote professional appraisal practices. Request outside
appraisals when necessary. This helps maintain state compliance and tax revenue levels by
supporting valuations made by office staff.
 Maintain digital parcel maps that are accurately registered to our aerial base and that meet State
parcel mapping and numbering requirements.
Highlights:
 Remote-sensing technology, implemented in 2007, helped improve the efficiency of our operation
and reduced field inspection costs. Oblique imagery is helpful to other departments/users.
 Improved work practices to eliminate numerous inactive personal property accounts in 2012 and
2013.
 A new web site, implemented in March 2011, allows us to post values on all real estate parcels and
show what physical characteristics we have on all property. Compliments have been received from
the public.
 Use of WiFi-enabled tablet PC’s for field data collection. These devices allow us to log in directly to
Orion and will help reduce data entry costs. Improvements in mobile devices for data collection hold
promise for future reductions in costs.
New Initiatives:
 Adequate funding to hire several appraisal and/or administrative staff positions. These positions will
be used to improve efficiencies in maintaining land records and compliance with State and statutory
requirements.
 Continue working on the sketch conversion project undertaken in 2012-13 to move old sketches
into current ‘APEX’ sketch format. APEX is an industry standard improvement sketching application
and part of the Orion CAMA application. It allows us to more accurately sketch property and identify
square footages, by use.
 Request a review of digital map data and work to get parcel dimensions into a parcel map layer.
This will allow us to verify the accuracy of our parcel maps and aid us in the valuation process. This
task was not done when the original State mapping requirements were implemented.

Division Overview
Workforce Development/Commission Relations
Division Overview:
Workforce Development/Commission Relations is under the auspicious of the County Administrator’s
Office. This is a unique consolidation of services and responsibilities in an effort to reduce costs.
Workforce Development works in partnership with community organizations, educational institutions,
other workforce organizations, state, local, private and nonprofit agencies who share a common goal of
providing training and employment services to enable the unemployed and under-employed to become
economically self-sufficient. A well-functioning workforce leads to economic growth, resulting in more
job opportunities. Commission Relations supports the work of the Board of Commissioners and aids in
the effective execution of Commission duties. The Director’s responsibility is to assist commissioners
with problem resolution and develop information for use by the commissioners, both individually and
collectively. The Director works with the County Administrator and departments at multiple levels to
resolve issues and develop policies, procedures, and practices to improve the delivery of county
government services on behalf of the Board of Commissioners. Commission Relations is also
responsible for the overall operations, management, and oversight of the Commission Office,
Important Issues:
 Provide local businesses with a skilled, trained, and qualified workforce
 Create meaningful internship experiences and expand the program to all schools districts and
the business community
 Decrease unemployment rates in Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas
 Consolidate resources to cultivate a pipeline of well-trained, well-educated Wyandotte County
workers who can benefit from available job opportunities in our county
 Attract and retain Wyandotte County residents for new job opportunities
 Improve public awareness of educational and job training resources and opportunities
 Align the education pipeline more directly with the needs of the local economy
Highlights:
 The Wyandotte County Employment Consortium meets on a monthly basis to exchange
information about the local workforce needs, upcoming job fairs, training opportunities, job
opportunities and other resources available to the jobseeker and the employer.
 The Unified Government remains one of the primary sponsors of an annual job fair held each
fall, reaching out to military veterans and the public, benefiting jobseekers and employers.
 The Unified Government continues to be the primary employer in the area to provide internship,
job shadowing and mentoring opportunities for high school and college students
 Continue a partnership with the KCK School District to encourage Wyandotte County
businesses to participate in the high school internship program
New Initiatives:
 Expand the student internship program to all school districts and encourage local businesses to
provide internships, mentoring, and job-shadowing opportunities for students to explore various
career avenues, thus, providing employers early opportunities to gauge the talents of a new
generation of workers.
 Collaborate with WYEDC, KCKCC, and Workforce Partnership to assist with the development of
strategic workforce solutions to maximize workforce services to employers, helping them retain
workers, and increase their pool of trained/qualified workers.

Department Overview
Delinquent Revenue Collections Department
Department Overview:
The Department of Delinquent Revenue Collections is responsible for the oversight and collection of
delinquent revenues owed to the Unified Government by way of a Judicial Tax Sale Process. The
Kansas Set-Off Program is an additional area of collection in the Delinquent Revenue Department.
This program allows the State of Kansas to garnish/collect delinquent revenue(s) owed to the Unified
Government from income tax refunds, lottery winnings, inheritance, state wages, etc.
Important Issues:


Provides direct oversight for professional development and implementation of policies and
procedures for effectively collecting delinquent taxes and fees, provides technical review of all
development agreements to assure compliance with state statutory requirements and payments
to be made to the Unified Government, and upholds direct responsibility for the distribution of
public information to facilitate and optimize revenue collection business processes and policies
in accordance to statutory law.



Consistently review/revise/apply best management practices to increase program capacities
and improve number/type/value of individual parcels to improve ROI business ratios, develop
statistical business models to analyze both financial and demographic trends of both the Kansas
Set-Off Program and Delinquent Real Estate Judicial Tax Sale process in relation to cash-flow
analysis and long-term capitalization forecast.



Created official Facebook page to publish official/accurate business content and/or utilize
strategic marketing publications (pamphlets, tax sale property slideshows, etc.) in specified
locations to enhance both public and business awareness.

Highlights:


Due to statutory time constraints, revolving sales dates, and outdated business practices, the
Delinquent Real Estate Division converted from a three tax sales per-year cycle to two tax sales
per-year business cycle in FY 2013. The May 2013 Tax Sale officially established the projected
May/November (6-month) revolving timeline for any/all future tax sales. By establishing fixed
monthly dates on an annual basis, the business organization, including the States Judiciary and
Process Services Divisions, are now able to better prepare for the targeted deadlines.



Actively pursue delinquent taxes and/or lower taxes in our community by modifying historical
business practices to support statistical efficiency models. This allowed our staff to effectively
identify best management practices, track operational success across the newly projected
timeline, and enhance the UG’s ability to maximize delinquent revenue streams annually.
The financial rationale for conducting two tax sales per-year was evidenced by the recent
collections from Tax Sale #329 (May 2013). By comparison, the increase in delinquent sales tax
revenues from the previous tax sale (TS #328) was a 164.8% improvement. Since that time, the
Division has realized profit increases that consistently range from 42% through 397% when
including the recent May 2013 tax sale. The steady increase in delinquent income over the last
30 months is a testament to the improved business processes, the functional realignment of the
project-related timeline, and the proactive collection theories being applied by the Division.

Division Overview
Accounting Division
Division Overview:
The Accounting Division is responsible for maintaining the general ledger of the Unified Government

done in conjunction with the Payroll Division of the Finance Department.
 Received Government Finance Officers Association’s (GFOA) Certificate of Achievement for
Excellence in Financial Reporting for our 12/31/11 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
(CAFR).
 Developed new procedures during 2012 which eased the year-end process by redistributing
workload throughout the year.
 Established a new policy requiring minimum annual levels of training for all staff with each
member meeting the stated goal for 2012.
 Assumed the duties of preparing all year-end financial entries during the 2012 year-end process
which saves the Unified Government $30,000 annually by eliminating the utilization of an
accounting consulting firm.
New Initiatives:
 Continue upgrading the financial system through additional phases which are designed to save
the Unified Government technology dollars and provide users additional features.
 Continue Division progress to complete the year-end process without external audit support.
 Implement a new fixed asset system to allow for improved edit controls and reporting in an
efficient, more effective manner.

Department Overview
Legal

Department Overview:
The mission of the Legal Department is to provide quality and cost-effective legal and related services
for the Unified Government, both in its role as a city and as a county, the Board of Public Utilities, and
other Boards and Commissions of the Unified Government. The Department provides legal opinions
for elected officials, the County Administrator, and Unified Government and Board of Public Utilities
staff; is responsible for all litigation filed against any of those entities; reviews and prepares contracts;
drafts and reviews ordinances and resolutions; provides representation in more than 400 lawsuits and
claims on an annual basis; assists with delinquent tax sales; acquires property through the eminent
domain process; prosecutes all violations of city ordinances in Municipal Court; and monitors and
administers the Violence Against Women Act Grant whereby all municipal domestic violence cases are
prosecuted in Municipal Court.

Important Issues:




Economic development projects—legal opinions and transaction documents.
Responding to new initiatives from elected officials, several of whom are newly elected.
With the turnover of personnel, assisting recently hired or recently promoted staff in other
departments with the legal aspects of their positions.

New Initiatives:




Work with the Finance Department, Human Resources Department, and Purchasing
Department to restructure the Risk Management function.
Institute a pilot program to centralize file organization and storage, conduct legal research, and
facilitate collaboration among attorneys and administrative staff.
Use new Municipal Court software system (IMDS Plus) for prosecution of cases. The goal is for
all court proceedings to be entered on the computer and to eliminate the paper tickets.
Prosecutor’s Office staff will need to be trained on the system as well as the attorneys from the
Legal Department who either prosecute regularly (Code Enforcement attorney) or substitute in
Municipal Court. Additional laptops will need to be purchased for use in the courtroom.

Department Overview
Technology Department
Department Overview:
The Technology Department provides technical support services to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of Unified Government operations. Services include central computer services (central
computer operation, system development, equipment maintenance, software maintenance, training,
and support); personal computer support (specifications, procurement assistance, standards,
installation, networking, training, and support); telephone and cell phone support; document
management support; data communications; and GIS computer mapping support (selected spatial data
maintenance, repository, standards, networking, training, and support).
This Department strives to make technology a useful and effective tool for the departments of the
Unified Government. Technology changes very quickly, and it is essential that the Unified Government
obtain the greatest benefit possible by implementing and using technology in an appropriate and costeffective way.
Important Issues:








Loss of staff and budget cuts keep the department in a survival mode.
Working to meet technical support needs of Unified Government departments with reduced staff
and increased reliance on outside consultants.
Increasing complexity of technology requires more resources for administration.
Need to invest more in training technical staff to keep up with changes in technology.
Increasing numbers of open positions and higher salaries for many I.T. jobs in KC area makes
DOTS vulnerable to continue losing highly trained technical staff.
Many desktop PC’s are 6+ years old, and failures are more frequent, creating problems for
users and additional work for PC support staff.
Reduced capital expenditures have left most of our network equipment obsolete and beyond the
manufacturer’s end-of-life, increasing the risk of failures.

Highlights:




30+ year old air conditioner in main data center was replaced with much more reliable
equipment.
Continue to maintain a very high level of availability and reliability of technology resources.
Expanding wireless network in Unified Government buildings to accommodate wireless devices.

New Initiatives:





Providing support for Microsoft tablets and other mobile devices.
Assisting in moves of Unified Government employees to new Neighborhood Resource Center
and new Transit Center.
Working with other public agencies to study advantages and issues of sharing technology
resources (hardware, software, and staff) between technology departments.
Deploy more current versions of Microsoft Windows and Office to all desktops.

Department Overview
Community Corrections
Department Overview:
The Community Corrections Department is responsible for the supervision, intervention, and monitoring
of adult and juvenile offenders on probation, bond supervision, house arrest and electronic monitoring,
drug courts, and diversion services. The Department consists of four divisions: Adult Services,
Juvenile Services, Pre-Trial/House Arrest Services, and Criminal Justice Programming Services. The
mission statement of the Department is to “promote safety within our community through responsive
risk reduction.”
Important Issues:
 The vacancy rate for the Intensive Supervision Officer (ISO) position continues to be sustained at
an average rate of 30%. The Department struggles to attract, hire, and retain qualified employees.
The ISO position is the core of our activities, constituting 65% of all FTE’s. At the foundation of this
issue lies a compensation rate that falls below the local market value by more than $2.00 hr.
Insufficient staffing levels of supervision officers will ultimately impact the quality and quantity of
supervision provided to felony probationers in the community. If staffing issues are not quickly
addressed, public safety will potentially be compromised.
 Inadequate staffing levels will inevitably change the effectiveness of interventions and supervision
provided to the probationers. The result is likely to be a measurable decrease in successful
probationer completion. This decrease is expected to produce a significant reduction in funding
from State sources.
 As the number of offenders/defendants increase, the physical space allowed for operations has
become less than safe for probationer/defendant interactions.
Highlights:
 The Adult Services Division has consistently made strides to increase and maintain the successful
completion rate of felony offenders from 17.8% in FY06 to 54.7% in FY12. Increasing the
successful completion rate of offenders under supervision has directly impacted the reduction in
court hearings, jail days served, and total direct and indirect costs.
 The Department continues to foster strong, regional collaborations with other external and internal
criminal justice agencies.
o In 2013, collaboration between the Department and Johnson County, Kansas is expected to
produce the Wyandotte County-wide availability of the Caseworker Resource Center. This
tool allows for high-speed access to services/resources around the region for individuals
and agencies.
o A continued partnership with CRIMESTOPPERS has resulted, to-date, in the apprehension
of 67% (190) of the referred probation fugitives.
o The Juvenile Services Division continues to participate in a collaborative effort with the
Kansas Juvenile Justice Authority, the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, the
Annie E. Casey Foundation, and members of the local criminal justice system to examine
juvenile detention practices, impacts, and costs.
New Initiatives:
 The Department has taken additional steps in the development of a comprehensive strategic
management plan.
 The Department has been named as a pilot site for Multi-systemic Therapy (MST), the Juvenile
Justice Authority evidenced-based treatment approach to juvenile offenders and their families.

Division Overview
Fire Department Training Division
Division Overview:
The Fire Training Division is charged with the responsibility of maintaining and improving the
capabilities of Fire Department personnel through professionally oriented and comprehensive training
programs. Technology continues to impact the environment in which firefighters work; newly developed
materials used in today’s building construction can create highly toxic atmospheres and increased
potential for sudden structure failure resulting in death and injury. The Training Division is charged with
the responsibility of ensuring that firefighters are properly prepared to utilize the newest technology,

partnering with the community to provide effective and innovative police service.
Important Issues:


The Kansas City, Kansas Police Department tracks crime occurrences in three
categories: violent crime, property crime, and overall crime. The Department believes
that it is important for citizens to have a comprehensive view of crime in the community

decrease in overall crime from 2011 to 2012. Overall crime includes violent crimes and
property crimes reported to the Department.

New Initiatives:

Continue to build partnerships and collaboration with the community through Police
Department citizen academies, internships, the O.K. Program, Neighborhood Crime
Prevention Patrol (NCPP) activities, and other community involvement programs such as
organized athletic events for underprivileged youth.



Continue to research and implement the best practices for policies, training, and
enforcement strategies within the Department by seeking re-accredited status through
the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.



New CAD/RMS $2,000,000



A new policy/training software package that facilitates information flow in the
Department. Such a system would improve communication with the community.



New Police Academy Class – Projected to start in the first quarter of 2014.

New plan to work with other Unified Government agencies and social service providers
to address mental health issues that impact the Department on a daily basis.

Division Overview
Police Department/Criminal Investigations Bureau
Division Overview
The Bureau is responsible for felony case management, which includes accumulating all facts
and evidence in a manner to prove or disprove that a crime has occurred. When appropriate,
case management includes presenting information to the Wyandotte County District Attorney’s
Office or the United States District Attorney’s Office for the review and possible filing of changes
against a suspect of a crime. The ultimate goal is to document facts and prove beyond any
reasonable doubt, for a court of law, that the suspect accused of a crime did commit the specific
crime for which he is charged.
Important Issues



Maintain effective and efficient crime scene investigation techniques and training to
optimally recover physical evidence from crime scenes.
The Criminal Investigation Bureau will evaluate its processes and analyze its data to
ensure that the needs of the community are met with practices that maximize the
effectiveness and efficiency of its personnel.

Highlights




Aggressively investigated and referred prosecutions on homicides, robbery, rape and
other felony crimes or misdemeanor crimes for which collectively amount to felony crime
status.
Maintained contact with victims of felony crimes to keep them informed of any progress
made in their case status and identified ways to prevent continued victimization.
The national clearance rate for homicide was 64.8% and the KCKPD’s was 72% in 2011.
The Kansas City Kansas Police Department’s 2012 clearance rate was 80%; however,
information that could affect this rating is still pending.

New Initiatives





Increase the Criminal Investigation Bureau’s effectiveness and strategy to identify violent
and property crime offenders, and identify locations that are vulnerable to criminal
enterprise; both of which will increase opportunities to deter criminal activity.
Redefine case processing with up-to-date management practices (Frontline Program) for
accuracy and accountability.
Maintain evidence retention with the best practices for storage and retrieval. This
includes physical measures and data interfacing with bar-coding to enhance audits of
logistical inventories.
To provide long-term solutions for communicating with victims about the services that
can be provided by the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department from the Victim’s
Assistance Unit. New marketing techniques will be utilized to facilitate this process.

Division Overview
Police Department/Bureau of Operations

Division Overview:
The Bureau of Operations patrol function, in its simplest terms, is to prevent and deter criminal activity
and to provide day-to-day police service to the community. The Bureau’s mission is to protect life and
property, to prevent and suppress crime, and to preserve the public order, all in the effort to provide the
highest quality of life to our citizens, businesses and visitors. The Division will achieve its mission
through community policing and intelligence-led policing strategies. These strategies focus on the
causes of crime and place an emphasis on integrating policing with the community and the
neighborhoods by using criminal intelligence information as a guide.

Important Issues:




Continue to develop programs and initiatives that encourage community involvement in
developing strategies to improve the quality of life throughout the city.
Continue to address crime issues in the urban core.
Develop enforcement initiatives targeted specifically at individuals who are known to be involved
in, or associated with, gangs throughout the city.

Highlights:



In 2012, the Bureau of Operations assisted the Neighborhood Crime Prevention Patrol (NCPP)
in organizing and conducting an NCPP Academy. The Division also assisted the group with
rewriting a manual and creating a digital copy so future updates can be easily done.
In 2012, the Bureau of Operations worked closely with all the school districts in growing the
Junior Police Academy in order to improve police/teen interactions.

New Initiatives:




Conduct “Meet & Greet” functions in all four patrol divisions to give the community an
opportunity to meet their district patrol officers.
Partner with the school districts within the jurisdiction in the implementation of the Standard
Response Protocol (SRP) created by the “i love u guys” foundation. The SRP provides a
template for schools to use on how to handle critical incidents, like an active shooter.
The Division partnered with Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and Downtown
Shareholders (DTS) to develop a “Safer Community Grant” for downtown businesses. It is a
matching grant, up to $500, for businesses to make improvements, based on a Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) analysis, to reduce the chances of the
business being victimized.

Communications Center for Wyandotte County, Kansas City, Bonner Springs, and
Edwardsville, KS.
 Development and implementation of Department strategic plan for crowd management
for large events throughout the city given the economic growth, retail development, and
new business opportunities.
 A new traffic enforcement initiative to reduce traveler casualties and the emotional and
economic burdens of crashes utilizing education, enforcement, engineering, and
emergency medical services in a collaborative process.

Department Overview
Public Safety Business Office

Department Overview:
The Public Safety Business Office (PSBO) handles all the fiscal functions for Community Corrections,
the Sheriff’s Department, the Police Department, and the Juvenile Corrections Advisory Board (JCAB).
PSBO was created by combining the fiscal and time keeping staff from the respective departments in
2003.
Bill payment, contract management, grant management, and time keeping are all labor intensive
processes. Time keeping is particularly time sensitive. The merger created the capacity to cross train
staff who had previously worked in isolation. A single absence no longer brings any department’s fiscal
functions to a stop. The synergy of the process allows the fiscal and time keeping functions to be
carried out more effectively even though the overall staff has been reduced by three positions, saving
over $100,000 in salaries annually.
Because PSBO staff has extensive experience with grants, the department is often involved in writing
and managing grants outside of the public safety area. PSBO manages many, and tracks all, American
Reinvestment & Recovery Act (ARRA) stimulus grants as an example.

Important Issues:


Grants at the State and Federal level are becoming less common and more competitive. The
trend is likely to continue. Alternative funding for essential services is a significant issue as old
grants expire.

Highlights:




In 2013, the Public Safety Business Office has continued to be heavily engaged in seeking grant
funding. The department continues to work with the Federal government to meet greatly
increased compliance and reporting requirements as we wrap up the ARRA grants.
Staff workloads have increased due to open positions not being filled. Even with the loss of two
out of three Fiscal Officers, the remaining PSBO staff has been able to complete essential
functions by required deadlines for all departments served.
In response to shortages, PSBO cross-training and efficiency have exceeded the historic
practices level.

Department Overview
Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office
Department Overview:
Kansas sheriffs maintain a number of explicit statutory duties, including the following general duties:
(K.S.A. 19-811): the Sheriff has charge and custody of the jail; K.S.A. 19-812: the Sheriff shall serve
and execute…all process, writs, etc. …and shall attend upon the several courts of record held in his/her
county…;(K.S.A. 19-813): it is the duty of the Sheriff to keep and preserve the peace in his/her
county… These duties are broad and cannot be usurped by a Board of County Commissioners.
Sheriff’s Administration oversees the daily functions of the Sheriff’s Office mission. Our mission is to
serve the citizens of Wyandotte County demonstrating integrity and professionalism in our operations,
while promoting a healthy and productive work environment, and maintaining efficiency and
effectiveness in support of the criminal justice system.
Important Issues:






Transition to the double-bunking initiative in the Adult Detention Center is ongoing and Phase I of
the initiative is complete. Double-bunking is occurring in one housing unit and the second housing
unit will be utilized once authorized manpower is complete. Inmate housing costs for farm-outs were
reduced $4.2 million in 2010 to $3.2 million in 2011 to $2.6 million in 2012 since instituting the plan.
Overtime costs are excessive in the Operations Division due to inadequate staffing. For the most
recent previous three-month period, over 50% of overtime has been to cover Court Transport, Outof-County Transport, and Patrol Services. An extrapolation of that figure results in a projected
overtime cost of $502,000 for 2013. Additional authorized personnel paid for by shifting some of this
cost will result in greater fiscal efficiency and operational effectiveness.
Pay compression presents a number of challenges for organizations, but the two critical issues are
(1) morale in the management/command ranks and (2) the limited number of qualified and/or
exceptional candidates who are willing to position themselves for promotion. These two issues are
particularly critical in the public safety professions.

Highlights and New Initiatives:





The agency’s vehicle fleet is aging and becoming very expensive to maintain. The Sheriff is working
with Unified Government Administration to address the issue in a budget initiative.
Development of Phase II of the double-bunking Initiative will require approval for additional
personnel but will result in increased capacity and lower inmate housing farm-out expense. This is
anticipated for 2015 when it is more practical to provide the up-front staff expense.
The Sheriff’s Training Unit needs to develop the capacity and be supported with the resources to
handle training independent of KCKPD.
The Sheriff’s Office is developing a proposal to effectively address the issue of pay compression
between agency members represented by the bargaining unit and the Command Staff. The current
differential is 7%. Recent compensation studies indicate that the average and acceptable pay
differential between the highest paid union employee and the first level supervisor employee
outside the union is between 13.5% and 14.5%.

Division Overview
Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office Community and Support Services Division
Division Overview:
The Community and Support Services Division of the Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office
consists of the Training Unit; Records Unit; Offender Registration/Concealed Carry Permit Unit;
Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center (JIAC); and Reserve Deputy Unit. Community and
Support Services personnel are also responsible for all Information Technology issues. The
Division provides support services to the Operations Division, Adult Detention Center, Juvenile
Detention Center, and outside agencies as needed.
Important Issues:






Maintain the proper level of staffing in the Records Unit to provide customer service on a 24
hour, 7 day per week basis.
Train all newly hired detention deputies and maintain all appropriate records; schedule and
report annual in-service training for all sworn law enforcement certified deputies; maintain
firearms qualification certification and corresponding records; and assist in recruiting.
Register violent, drug, and sex offenders, as mandated by Kansas statute; verify offenders’
addresses, places of employment, school attendance, etc.; process all concealed carry
handgun permits; and complete all required paperwork for the Kansas Attorney General.
Process and assess the needs of over 2,400 children through the Juvenile Intake and
Assessment Center to prevent further involvement in the juvenile justice system.
Provide volunteer deputies through the Reserve Deputy Unit to assist during Sheriff’s Office
events, Identi-Kid programs in the community, and McGruff the Crime Dog’s appearance at
community events. The Unit also provides support for all Sheriff’s Department divisions.

Highlights and New Initiatives:






Wyandotte County currently has over 1,200 registered drug, sex, and violent offenders who
either live, work, or attend school in the county. Of this number, 700 plus are registered for
various sex offenses and one deputy and one clerk register and monitor these offenders.
The Department has been awarded a Justice Assistance Grant to hire, and fund for two
years, two compliance officers and one investigator for this unit.
The Sheriff’s Office currently has 75 deputies certified as Law Enforcement Officers in the
State of Kansas. This number continues to grow as more deputies are sent to obtain Law
Enforcement Certification. Kansas Statute mandates that each law enforcement officer
attend a minimum of 40 hours of in-service training annually to maintain their certification.
For the past several years, the Kansas City Kansas Police Department Academy has been
utilized for this training, which has created concern for the Academy staff. The creation of e
an “in-house” training curriculum for all law enforcement certified deputies would relieve the
KCK Police Department of training these 75 deputies.
The implementation of a Volunteer/Intern Program to assist with the Juvenile Intake and
Assessment Center (JIAC) functions is being proposed. JIAC is a 24 hour per day, 7 day a
week, 365 day per year operation. Utilizing volunteers/interns could decrease overtime
costs, could provide a nurturing environment for the children through volunteers/interns
acting as mentors, and be available to accompany staff on transports to placement facilities,
as needed. An appropriately trained intern could also assist JIAC staff with coverage.

Division Overview
Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office Operations Division
Division Overview:
The Operations Division of the Sheriff’s Office provides services to the citizens of the cities of Kansas
City, Bonner Springs, Edwardsville, Lake Quivira as well as the unincorporated areas of the County.
The Operations Division also provides service for the three court systems: Wyandotte County District
Court, Wyandotte County Juvenile Court, and Kansas City Municipal Court.

Important Issues:
The Operations Division shall:







Serve civil process for the Wyandotte County court system, as well as any court of competent
jurisdiction throughout the country when the target is within our county.
Execute court orders pertaining to probate, evictions, tax sales, mortgage foreclosures,
repossessions, and protection from abuse, etc.
Enforce state statutes, city and county ordinances, investigate crimes, prepare cases for review by
the District Attorney, and execute search and arrest warrants.
Serve warrants issued by the Wyandotte County District Court. These warrants may be served
anywhere in the United States and the arrestee transported back to Wyandotte County.
Be responsible for transporting all prisoners to and from penal institutions for court appearances,
and to penal institutions after sentencing for incarceration.
Be responsible for patrol, answering calls for service, and investigating crimes in 53 parks and 13
cemeteries in Wyandotte County.

Highlights and New Initiatives


Overtime costs are excessive in the Operations Division due to the difficulty in maintaining
authorized staffing levels. For example, for the most recent previous three-month period there have
been 3,375 hours of overtime worked. The three functions requiring the largest amount of overtime
(just over 50% of the total) to cover include court transport, out-of-county transport, and patrol. An
extrapolation of that figure results in a projected overtime cost in the Operations Division of
$502,000 for the year 2013. Additional authorized personnel paid for by shifting some of these costs
will result in greater fiscal efficacy.

Division Overview
Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Adult and Juvenile Detention Centers
Division Overview:
The Wyandotte County Adult and Juvenile Detention Centers provide a safe, secure, and humane
environment for staff and persons lawfully incarcerated by the criminal justice system. The Wyandotte
County Juvenile Detention Center (JDC) provides short-term care and secure custody to juveniles who
are awaiting placement or release to parents/guardians. The goal is to provide the basic needs for
juvenile detainees, such as shelter, food, clothing, medical care, mental health and basic hygienic
needs. The Juvenile Detention Center’s duty is to prevent the abridgement of juvenile detainees’ legal
rights during detainment and ensure that they are free from fear, assault, or any type of intimidation by
staff and other juveniles. Both Detention Centers shall adhere to regulations of the Kansas Department
of Health and Environment (KDHE), to performance standards required by the American Correctional
Association, and to mandates of the Juvenile Justice Authority (JJA). The Adult Detention Center
seeks to adhere to performance standards set by the American Correctional Association, the National
Institute for Corrections, the American Jail Association, and the National Sheriff’s Association.
Important Issues:




Continue to hire qualified applicants to fill vacancies developed by attrition in order to maintain
KDHE and JJA mandatory staffing guidelines.
Develop and promote exceptionally qualified supervisory and command personnel in order to
ensure the effective and efficient operation of the Juvenile Detention Center and Adult Detention
Center.
Development and proposal of Phase II Detention Center staffing plan to increase inmate
population in the facility.

Highlights and New Initiatives





The Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office and Detention Center continues seeking alternative
methods of housing detainees to include double bunking and farm-outs to offset rising housing
costs.
The Adult Detention Center is currently installing inmate video visitation to offer low cost inmate
family visitation and attorney visitation.
The Adult Detention Center continues seeking enhancements to both operational procedures
and contractual services through implementation of state-of-the-art technological solutions.
The Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Office Juvenile Detention Center is developing a new initiative
to provide mentoring to juvenile detainees. A recent reduction in contractual programming
provides an opportunity to collaborate with several Professional Mentors in the Wyandotte
County area that can provide one or two hours per week to mentor juvenile detainees. The goal
is to keep the juvenile detainees’ minds focused on learning and to reduce the number of
infractions within the Juvenile Detention Center.

Department Overview

District Attorney

Department Overview:
The Office of the District Attorney is a statutorily created state office that is found in the six most
populace judicial districts in Kansas. K.S.A. 22a-104 states that it is the duty of the district attorney to
appear in the courts of the counties in its judicial district to represent the people of those counties. The
position of district attorney is an elected position and serves as an executive officer of its judicial district.
The district attorney is not an officer of the county.
Wyandotte County is part of the twenty-ninth judicial district and is presently the only county in that
judicial district. The present district attorney is Jerome A. Gorman, who has served as district attorney
since January, 2005. The District Attorney is the chief law enforcement official for the Twenty-ninth
Judicial District of Wyandotte County, Kansas.
The mission of the Office of the District Attorney is to ensure the fair and just administration of justice
throughout Wyandotte County. The office is guided by ever changing Kansas statutes and federal and
state appellate decisions.
The chief duties of the Office of the District Attorney are to file and prosecute adult and juvenile criminal
cases that occur within the judicial district. The office files more than 1500 adult felony cases and 800
felony and misdemeanor juvenile cases each year. More than eighty cases result in a jury trial each
year, the second highest total in Kansas.
Other duties of the office involve the protection of children through Children in Need of Care cases
(CINC), consumer protection matters, involuntary commitments involving persons that may harm others
or themselves, truancies from school for juveniles under the age of 16, and search warrants and other
orders for law enforcement agencies. The office defends convictions that are obtained in the district
court before the appellate court of Kansas. More than sixty cases each year are briefed and argued
before either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. The District Attorney also litigates the
forfeiture of real estate, personal property and currency from criminal acts.
The District Attorney or one of his assistants responds 24/7 to every homicide and major case that
occurs within the county. The District Attorney currently has twenty-three assistant prosecutors working
under him. There is also a staff of twenty-nine investigators, victim advocates, litigation technologist,
and administrative support personnel.
In 2013 the District Attorney is creating an initiative to have a new diversion program. The program will
be administered entirely by the District Attorney’s staff and provide an alternative to convictions for nonviolent first time offenders. The program will also cover first time DUI offenders and certain traffic
offenses. The cost of operating the diversion program will be paid for by the offenders themselves.

Department Overview
District Court
Department Overview:
District Court is comprised of five divisions.
Within these divisions, sixteen judges handle
approximately 40,000 cases that are filed annually in Wyandotte County.
District Court Services is responsible for coordinating jurors, recording and transcribing all court
proceedings, and programming services for all divisions, judges, and staff.
The District Court Division is charged with the duties of filing, recording, and maintaining criminal, civil,
and child support cases. Probate, adoption, mental illness, marriage, and license records are an
integral part of this division.
Wyandotte Juvenile Department is one of the larger sections of the District Court. The Children in
Need of Care (CINC) division is charged with investigating cases filed alleging child abuse, neglect, etc.
and making recommendations to the Court to ensure that children are placed in the least restrictive
environment. If the children are removed from parental care, staff ensures that services from
community resources are provided to assist reunification of the family as soon as possible.
The Juvenile Offender division is mandated to conduct pre-sentence investigations and make
recommendations to the Court based on what is in the best interest of the child while ensuring public
safety. Those juvenile offenders who remain in the home on probation are supervised by this staff.
Adult Probation is the division that handles adult pre-sentence investigations and submits
recommendations to the Court based on Kansas sentencing guidelines. They also supervise adult
offenders on probation to this judicial district in an effort to rehabilitate offenders. Public safety is one of
the primary missions of this division.
Domestic Court Services provides court-ordered services in child custody and visitation disputes. They
also facilitate several groups such as Forward Focus on Family, Sensible Approach to Divorce (SAD),
etc. Mediation services and referral to the Child Exchange and Visitation Center are also provided.
The State Cases Division collects all case-related expenses that can be charged back to the State of
Kansas.
The Court Administrator is responsible for supervising and coordinating the administrative functions and
operations of the District Court and supervises and directs the activities of non-judicial personnel.

Important Issues:



The influx of non-English speaking persons continues to require additional translation expenses.
The Kansas Supreme Court ruling on June 20, 2008, allowed juveniles an opportunity for a jury
trial, instead of allowing judges’ discretion on which cases can have jury trials, and has resulted
in additional expenses. The full impact of this ruling will continue to be monitored in 2013-2014.

Department Overview
Municipal Court
Department Overview:
The Municipal Court processes traffic and misdemeanor tickets for Kansas City, Kansas and is
responsible for the collection of payments from violators. Law enforcement agencies that issue tickets
are the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department, Wyandotte County Sheriff’s Department, University of
Kansas (KU) Police Department, and railroad security. Other departments within the Unified
Government issuing tickets include Parking Control, Animal Control, Code Enforcement, License,
Building Inspection, and Water Pollution Control. The Probation Department (a subdivision of the
Court) monitors defendants placed on probation and refers defendants to House Arrest agencies and
monitors restitution payments ordered by the court.

Important Issues:






The Court is implementing a new records management system that will reduce data entry and
assist the Police Department with disposition history of tickets.
The Court is facing a backlog of state-mandated disposition reports. With the new RMS, staff
hopes to eventually develop an interface to reduce paperwork and errors.
The Court would like to implement a finger-printing system for all convicted of a misdemeanor.
With a new RMS, new interfaces will be required for the Sheriff’s Department and Code
Enforcement.
The Court is facing an increasing number of defendants who have mental health or substance
abuse issues. The Court has participated in jail population meetings and assisted with obtaining
grants to screen defendants with these issues. This has reduced jail population and the
problems associated with dealing with frequent offenders.

Highlights:
.
 Direct communication with the Kansas City, Kansas Police Department will be restored and the
Police Department will have access to important criminal record information needed for their
safety.
 Communications with the Driver’s License Bureau will be streamlined.
 Online payments will be accepted with new records management system.
 Frequent communication with the Sheriff and District Court has resulted in more cooperation.
 The Court implemented a new fine schedule on May 1, 2013.

New Initiatives:



Municipal Court continues to improve operations to provide efficient and expedient service to
those conducting business with the Court.
Municipal Court’s mission is to assure fair and equal treatment for all.

Division Overview
3-1-1 Operations
Division Overview:
3-1-1 is a unique customer service initiative that was deployed by the Unified Government (UG) to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of deliverable services to citizens in Wyandotte County. The
UG’s 3-1-1 network allows the operations center to proactively review/revise business processes and
organizational policies to meet expectations from constituents by providing a simple three-digit access
number to contact a live person to answer general questions, submit and track work orders, and provide
performance-based outcomes. 3-1-1 Operations also serves a project-based function, focused on
software application development for Microsoft Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Business
Intelligence (BI) to improve and measure customer service delivery and the dynamic/economic impacts
for Unified Government operations.
Important Issues:





3-1-1 offers opportunity to divert non-emergency calls from the 9-1-1 emergency call center,
improve citizen service, and better manage available resources.
3-1-1 improves the Unified Government’s customer service capabilities while providing important
tools for measuring an organization’s value and interdepartmental efficiencies, and provides
reductions in annual administrative costs.
3-1-1 Operations offers visibility and transparency in the Unified Government’s operations.
Ongoing staff reductions has directly impacted 3-1-1 Operations in respect to major increases in
abandoned and dequed calls, and extended on-hold times. Annual call volumes continue to
increase, but, our physical capacity to answer these calls has consistently diminished.

Highlights:





Provides citizens with a single point of contact by way of telephone, via the Web, email, fax, or
regular US Postal Service.
Serves as a catalyst for significant transformation—reinvents how municipalities serve their
citizens, improves constituent relationships, and more efficiently uses allocated resources.
Creates a central repository to analyze trends in service requests, timeliness, and effectiveness
of service delivery.
Utilizes hardware/software and live agents to answer/resolve call requests on a first-call basis.

New Initiatives:









Review current CRM business application model (Microsoft CRM V4.0) for viability and
recommend any/all system upgrades to enhance future performance.
Utilize existing 3-1-1 database to create organization-wide central repository. Using Public Works
as the initial pilot operation, an electronic, closed-loop business process will be developed, tested
and deployed to enhance/track current operations.
Develop managerial performance dashboard to: (a) communicate/refine business strategies; (b)
increase operational insight and coordination; (c) deliver a consistent view of the organization by
consolidating and integrating operational logistics; (d) reduce expenditures and redundancy; and
(e) deliver actionable information, timely data-driven reporting models.
The 3-1-1 contact center should maximize system efficiency by proactively issuing outbound
notifications. Proactive notifications might be used to alert citizens of important changes in
governmental services or program initiatives that improve citizen satisfaction.
Use newly developed mobility software to record specific on-hold voice notifications to inform
public of operational status and/or marketing of improved UG services.
Deploy decentralized staffing model to support operational requirements/efficiencies (handle daily
call-volume, improve abandoned call rates, on-hold times, etc.).
Create official Facebook page to publish current business content (i.e. general business updates,
statistical call volumes, quarterly online business reports). Create user feedback forum to
enhance public usage/awareness and current Best Management Practices across the industry.

Department Overview
Wyandotte/Leavenworth Area Agency on Aging and Disability Resource Center

Department Overview:
The mission of the Wyandotte/Leavenworth Area Agency on Aging and Disability Resource Center is to
act as the single point-of-entry, where older adults, persons with disabilities, and their caregivers can
navigate through a network and become linked with information that allow them to make informed
choices about services and supports, with a primary focus of maintaining independence in their own
home and communities.
The Area Agency on Aging is responsible for planning, implementing, and administering services to
seniors and the disabled at the local level. The focal point centers on services that allow consumers to
remain in their own homes independently.
Important Issues:


Governor Brownback has implemented an over-haul of Medicaid unlike any type of reform that
has taken place in recent years. Under this Medicaid reform, the Area Agency on Aging’s
service administration will be opened up to serve not only seniors, but consumers 18 years of
age plus. This sweeping change on how Medicaid consumers are served will significantly
impact the Area Agency on Aging in the areas of staffing and service delivery.
 The impending effect of the sequestration outcomes could impact the Area Agency on Aging’s
budget for the next fiscal year.
 The increasing number of baby boomers and disabled populations entering the service network
and the dwindling dollars being allocated for services is an important concern.
.
Highlights:




Responded to a Request for Proposal (RFP) from the state to provide statewide ADRC
coverage.
Received a sub-contract to provide three deliverables: information, referral and assistance
options, counseling and functional assessments to all populations in the Wyandotte and
Leavenworth service areas.
Anticipating move to the new transit hub in mid-town Kansas City, Kansas.

New Initiatives:



The Area Agency on Aging became a sub-contractor for The Center of Medicare and Medicaid
Transitions in Care grant. This program allows coaches to adequately transition consumers
back into the community from the hospital.
The Area Agency on Aging partnered with the Kansas Guardianship Program and Adult
Protective Services/Department for Children and Families to offer limited guardianship and
conservatorship to at-risk individuals who have been victims of abuse, neglect, or exploitation.

Department Overview

County Coroner

Department Overview:
The County Coroner’s office is established by the State of Kansas (KSA 22a-226). The County
Coroner takes charge of dead bodies, makes inquiries regarding the cause of death, and provides a
cause of death report to the Clerk of the District Court in the county in which the death occurred. The
County Coroner designates a qualified pathologist to conduct autopsies as necessary.

Highlights:


The cost associated with unclaimed bodies has been increasing. Unclaimed or abandoned
bodies become costly as paperwork for families and due diligence to find family members can
take days and weeks. There are storage fees charged to the Coroner for maintaining any
unclaimed or abandoned body.

New Initiatives:


The office would like to convert all of the death investigation files currently on microfilm to a
digital format.



Updating the computers used by the County Coroner’s office would be of benefit. The two
computers currently in use were transferred to the County Coroner’s office from the private
practice of Dr. Hancock when he closed his medical office. They were obsolete when he
donated them to the county in 2009.

Department Overview
Department of Economic Development and Property Management
Department Overview:
The Department’s goal is to attract new and maintain existing business, industry and residential
housing in the community. Through a close relationship with Wyandotte Economic Development
Council (WYEDC), this Department works with existing businesses and industry to help them find ways
to grow and improve their business in our county while utilizing various economic development tools to
attract new developments. This approach to growing our community’s tax base has reached over into
the housing area in recent years through the use of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Program (NRA) to
encourage homeowners to reinvest in their property. Additionally, this NRA tool has developed into a
good tool to assist small business growth in the eastern areas of our community. The Department is
also working to actively market and sell government-owned property in the County and, when possible,
will couple land deals with incentive programs in order to make developments come together.
Important Issues:
 Retaining, expanding, and reinvesting in the existing industrial base, especially within the
Fairfax area, is critical to the future success of our community’s growth.
 Resolutions for the existing “Food Desert” portions of the community.
 Redrafting incentive policies as a result of legislative changes to Prevailing Wage.
Highlights:
 Encourage small business development and growth throughout the County.
 Selection of NorthPoint as the developer for the 80-acre RACER Trust site in Fairfax. This
development uses TDD, CID and IRBs, and should account for over 1M square feet of new
industrial space and 2,000 new jobs.
 Selection of Industrial Realty Group (IRG) to manage and redevelop the Public Levee site, with
an anticipated new 300k square feet of industrial space.
 Multifamily projects in the West, including over 900 new units approved: Delaware Heights
(under construction by Gold Crown); Residents at Village West (under construction by
NorthPoint); and Prairie Heights (a Filio’s project, awaiting financing). These projects all used
multi-family revenue bonds with zero percent tax abatement and are market-rate units.
 Working with several developers who are in various phases of the development process to
construct residential units in the Downtown corridor, with an overall goal of 5,000 new units.
 General Motors is making a $600M improvement to the GM Fairfax Plant in upgraded paint
technology, increasing the viability of the plant.
 Staff is reviewing multiple proposals in response to the Urban Grocery RFP, with the hopes of
announcing a full-scale Grocery project by the end of the year.
New Initiatives:
 Consolidation of development efforts with the Land Bank. Administration is proposing to move
the Land Bank under Economic Development and Property Management where community
development efforts can be coordinated along with land sales.
 Issuance of a Notice of Need for Real Estate Brokerage services.
 EPA awarded a $600k Brownfield Assessment Grant to a coalition effort by the Unified
Government, Kansas City, MO, and Mid-America Regional Council (MARC).
 Staff is contacting developers and potential end-users who are interested in investing in the
Midtown Redevelopment area for commercial and retail opportunities.

status in order to provide housing, new industry, and jobs for the citizens of the county. This includes
marketing, removing prior year taxes and assessments, maintaining an inventory list, and researching
neighborhoods in Wyandotte County that contain delinquent taxes.

Important Issues:




Collaborating with other Unified Government departments in the maintenance of Land Bankowned properties.
Contacting and educating adjacent homeowners about incoming Land Bank properties for sale.
Positioning the Land Bank to assist Wyandotte County and its citizens in the current foreclosure
market.

Highlights:


Provided the Land Bank Board of Trustees and various Unified Government departments,
information and data that identify tax delinquent areas of the County.

New Initiatives:




Proposing a new policy that will position the Land Bank in coordination with the Department of
Economic Development and Property Management to effectively utilize its status and strategy in
order to provide housing, new industry, and jobs for the citizens of the County
Proposing that all proceeds of Land Bank sales go into a fund to assist the Land Bank with the
regular maintenance of Land Bank properties..
Increase presence on the Land Bank website by including an online application and point-click
inventory that will include information from the Lands website.

Department Overview
Community Development Department
Department Overview:
The Community Development Department is responsible for the promotion of housing development
services to spur neighborhood revitalization in the urban core areas of the city. The Department is
supported through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, which is the Unified
Government’s entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The entitlement grant includes CDBG, Home Investment Partnership Program, and Emergency
Solutions Grant (ESG) funds. According to HUD regulations, 70% of the CDBG funds expended must
benefit low and moderate income persons and respond to at least one of three national objectives:
benefit low and moderate income persons; prevent or eliminate slum and blight; and meet other urgent
needs of the community which are a significant and immediate threat to the health and welfare of
residents for which there are no other resources. Eligible CDBG programs include housing
rehabilitation, infrastructure investments, economic development, demolition, public services, and
program administration.
HOME funds may be used to carry out multi-year housing strategies through acquisition, rehab and
new construction of housing. A minimum of 15% of the annual HOME allocation must be set aside for
Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDO’s). Current CHDO activities include new
construction and rehabilitation of housing. HOME funds may be spent on other housing activities
including the Community Housing Investment Partnership (CHIP) down payment assistance program
for eligible homebuyers.
The ESG Program is designed to increase the number and quality of emergency shelters and
transitional housing facilities for homeless individuals and families, to provide for the operation of these
facilities, to provide essential social services, and to prevent homelessness.
Important Issues:
 The amount of CDBG and HOME entitlement funding for 2013 has not been released;
however, it is anticipated that funding will be reduced by 5%. There is an effort at the
Congressional level to restore funding.
.
Highlights:
 The Department is responsible for carrying out activities for the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program 1 (NSP1) funded with Housing & Economic Recovery Acts funds. These funds
have been used to acquire, rehab and resell foreclosed properties in targeted areas. Fiftytwo units were acquired with thirty-three properties being sold, fifteen leased/purchased,
three to green space, and one property being marketed for sale.
 The Department has also received NSP3 funding from HUD entitlement funds and the State
of Kansas Department of Commerce NSP3 funds. These funds were used to acquire, rehab
and resell foreclosed properties in the area along Quindaro Boulevard from 10th Street to
27th Street. Nineteen properties are under construction, five properties are being rehabbed,
and two properties have been sold.
Initiatives:
 Transfer the Neighborhood Business Revitalization (NBR) Program from the Community
Development Department to the Neighborhood Resource Center (NRC), as the NBR
agencies work closely with all of the NRC divisions. Some of the divisions they work with
include Business Licensing, Code Enforcement, Liveable Neighborhoods, Operation
Brightside, and Rental Licensing.

Division Overview
Liveable Neighborhoods
Division Overview:
The mission of Liveable Neighborhoods is to provide information, training, resources, and a forum to
have open discussion with Unified Government staff to improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods.
Liveable Neighborhoods advocates for policies and ordinances that will enhance the quality of life in our
community and supports efforts that will promote the benefits of having an organized neighborhood
group. The monthly Liveable Neighborhoods meetings held at the Neighborhood Resource Center
provide the opportunity for neighborhood leaders and others to share information. Liveable
Neighborhoods initiated the Wyandotte 500 Program in 2010, with a goal to accomplish 500
laps/projects that make a positive difference in making our community a safer, healthier place to live.
Liveable Neighborhoods coordinates the annual Unified Government Neighborhood Group Assistance
Grants and sponsors the annual luncheon/dinner where the grants are distributed. Additionally, a
copying and phone tree service is provided for neighborhood groups so that they can distribute
information to their members. Liveable Neighborhoods works closely with the Community Policing Unit
to enhance the livability of our community and to support efforts that will promote the benefits of having
an organized neighborhood group.
Important Issues:
 Continue funding for the annual Unified Government Neighborhood Group Assistance Grants.
 Continue to fund CDBG for Liveable Neighborhoods operating expenses, which is currently
$25,000 for two years.
 Liveable Neighborhoods has been operating without an Administrative Support Specialist since
June of 2010. Due to this vacancy, the Neighborhood Liaison position has had to put aside her
job responsibilities to fulfill the Administrative Support Specialist duties.
Highlights:
 Liveable Neighborhoods continues to publish a monthly newsletter for neighborhood groups.
The newsletters are updated monthly to our web site.
 Liveable Neighborhoods supports and assists with the coordination of Land Bank activities,
which include scheduling and submitting reports for the Land Bank Neighborhood Advisory
Committee meetings.
 Liveable Neighborhoods provides approximately 40,000 copies of newsletters, flyers,
informational brochures, etc. for organized neighborhood groups.
 A phone tree has been re-established and is available for any neighborhood group that supplies
Liveable Neighborhoods with a list of phone numbers in their boundaries.
 The Liveable Neighborhoods office stocks over 50 brochures and informational materials and
creates new brochures for timely and accurate information as it relates to Unified Government
programs and initiatives.
 The Liveable Neighborhoods Wyandotte 500 Program, which began in 2010, has accomplished
over 40 projects with various neighborhood groups and organizations.
 The Liveable Neighborhoods monthly meetings are ever increasing in attendance. At the March
2013 meeting, there were over 80 people in attendance.
New Initiatives:
 In January 2013, Liveable Neighborhoods released a video that captures the stories and work of
some of our NBR’s and neighborhood leaders. The video can be seen on the Unified
Government’s Liveable Neighborhoods web page.

Department Overview
Wyandotte County Election Office

Department Overview:
The Wyandotte County Election Office conducts fair and honest elections. The integrity of elections is
guaranteed by accurately registering voters, providing advance voting, recruiting and training election
workers, and ensuring that every voting machine or counting board tabulates every legally cast vote.
Important Issues:











One full-time, one part-time, and 15 temporary positions remain unfunded. The Election Office
needs all of these positions to be funded for the successful execution of the 2014 elections. If
these positions remain unfunded, it may be impossible to handle the expected volume of voters,
voter registration applications, and advance ballot applications.
The complexity of all elections is greater because of new election laws. Preparation for the
2014 primary and general (mid-term) elections begins in April 2013.
Statutory changes provide expanded voting opportunities. Without adequate funding, the
potential opportunities remain unaffordable and unavailable.
The numbers of ADA-accessible polling places is at an all-time low. Increasing numbers of
voters are choosing to show up at any polling place rather than going to their assigned location
which forces an increase in the numbers of provisional ballots.
Federal and state law drives the complexity of and need for comprehensive training of election
workers. Election worker training has increased in quantity, quality, and duration. Training
hours have increased because of electronic poll books, voter photo ID, and voter assistance,
especially for disabled voters.
Voter expectations necessitate greater numbers of well-trained election workers. The Unified
Government Commission-approved fee paid to election workers has slipped below minimum
wage. This makes it much more difficult to recruit and retain good election workers. The fee
paid must be increased from $100 to $150.
The Election Office conducts a primary and general election annually, and may be required, with
no more than 120 days advance notice, to conduct multiple other special elections.

Highlights:



Voter education to explain voter photo identification requirements will expand in relation to the
nearness of Election Day with planned peaks prior to each of the scheduled elections.
Proof of citizenship is now required for voter registration.

New Initiatives:




Voter education to explain voter options, especially advance voting by mail, and a possible
change to vote centers for all voting. Vote centers make it possible for voters to vote at any one
vote center at any time during the period of advance voting or on Election Day. Suitable
locations, geographically dispersed, and reasonable costs are necessary for this to work.
Voter outreach to increase voter participation, especially for persons with disabilities, persons in
assisted-living facilities, new residents, military voters and overseas civilians.

Department Overview
Public Health Department
Department Overview:
The Health Department promotes good health and a safe environment for a better community by
providing a variety of services ranging from promoting and encouraging healthy lifestyle behavior to
diagnosing, investigating and preventing health and environmental problems and hazards in the
community.
Important Issues:
 There have been funds included in the budgets that were transferred from the Health Levy. In
the past, these funds have been used for building improvements, new public health initiatives, or
stabilizing programs that have received significant reductions in grant funding. As the Health
Levy’s fund balance declines, the ability to respond financially to the future needs of the
department becomes a concern.
 A Quality Management System is being developed and implemented at the department. This is
being done in response to organizational weaknesses identified in a Public Health Accreditation
Board (PHAB) self-assessment conducted. The Public Health Department seeks to become an
accredited local public health agency.
 Due to the federal sequestration, all funding for state/local direct services from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is being reduced by 5%. These funds are received as
pass-through-grants from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, and the funding
reductions will affect the following programs: Maternal and Child Health, Family Planning,
Communicable Diseases, and Public Health Emergency Preparedness.
 With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the department no longer provides any
primary care services but maintains a role in specialty clinical services in the areas of sexually
transmitted diseases and women’s health.
Highlights:
 Healthy Families Wyandotte expanded services through the Maternal Infant Early Childhood
Home Visitation Grant to include three additional case managers. Serving the most vulnerable
families in the community, this program seeks to improve the pregnancy, child development,
and family self-sufficiency through evidence-based interventions, community resource
acquisition, and education.
 Reorganized the medical records division to gain greater efficiency in the registration and check
out of patients for our clinical services. This involved the retraining/relocation of staff, additional
implementation of our electronic medical records, and significant remodeling to the lobby and
medical records area. The department conducted satisfaction surveys with patients and
employees and saw significant increases in overall satisfaction.
 For the second consecutive year, the Public Health Department received a perfect 100% score
on the Local Technical Assistance Review (LTAR) from the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment. The LTAR reviews Wyandotte County’s ability to receive, distribute, and dispense
medications received from the federal/state government to the entire community within a 48hour period.
 A five-year grant was received from the Voices for Children Foundation to establish a Fetal
Infant Mortality Review Board. The goal of the review board is to enhance the health and wellbeing of women, infants, and families by improving the community resources and service
delivery systems available to the families of Wyandotte County.

Department Overview
Neighborhood Resource Center
Department Overview:
The Neighborhood Resource Center (NRC) assists with coordinating resources to address and
confront problems and issues facing the community's neighborhoods. NRC divisions, along
with assistance from Community Policing, Operation Brightside, Public Works, Liveable
Neighborhoods, Health Department, Legal Department, Municipal Court, and Community
Development form a single resource center. NRC works with many Unified Government
departments to address problems and works to empower and partner with neighborhood groups
to overcome neighborhood problems and issues.
Important Issues:
 Safety of staff
 Concern with the Department’s ability to keep NRC technology applications current and
efficiently operating, while trying to meet the everyday needs and demands related to the
database applications and hardware maintenance.
 Need to stay abreast of technology changes and initiatives that can provide efficiencies and
better serve our customers.
 A new home for the NRC is currently being renovated at 4953 State Avenue, with the
opening of the new facility scheduled for early this summer of 2013. During the process of
the move, a substantial number of temporary duties has been added for the NRC staff. The
Department has been housed inside the Indians Springs facility since 1999 and the site is
slated for redevelopment in the future.
 Continued training and education for staff to ensure professional and accurate enforcement
of codes and standards.
 Trying to recover from the past economic downturn and the impacts it has had on the NRC
Divisions and programs over the past several years.
New Initiatives:
 Current efforts are under way to upgrade our application server (MAUWI) and database to
the most recent version. This will open the door to provide future technology enhancements,
such as electronic plan review and acceptance of credit cards for payment. It will also revisit
and upgrade the Department’s ability to provide the capability to electronically receive and
update inspection information in the field. This application/data base is used by all of the
NRC Divisions as well as Planning, Health Department, and Engineering.
 Continue to engage community, neighborhood leaders, and groups in an effort to explore
potential solutions for addressing abandoned and nuisance properties. Currently, there is an
ad hoc committee that meets monthly to discuss and brainstorm how to best address those
concerns. The governing body will start to see Requests for Commission Action on some of
the efforts coming out of this group, as well as some associated sub-committees, later this
year.
 Transfer the Neighborhood Business Revitalization (NBR) program from the Community
Development Department to the Neighborhood Resource Center (NRC). The NBR agencies
work most closely with Business Licensing, Code Enforcement, Liveable Neighborhoods,
Operation Brightside, and Rental Licensing.
This will be an opportunity to align
departmental protocols and priorities with the Commission’s strategic planning goals and
objectives.

Division Overview
Business Licenses and Enforcement Division
Division Overview:
The Business License Division is responsible for the enforcement of numerous Unified
Government taxation and regulated licensing ordinances. The Division primarily bills, collects,
and processes fees prescribed by these ordinances.
Important Issues:


The Business License Division filled one vacant position and hopes to fill the remaining
vacant position. The Division expects the reduced staffing to be reversed resulting in an
increased capacity to collect revenue and identify unregistered businesses.

Highlights:





The Division continued the annual renewal process with a December 1 start date. Positive
results continue with the shift of a substantial amount of data processing from January to
December and a significant amount of 2013 revenue received in the month of December.
Collection of total revenues fell very slightly in 2012. The Division collected 1.04% less than
anticipated; however, since there was no increase in regulatory license fees, the actual
comparison to prior-year totals was about the same.
The Division supported the Fire Marshal on changes to retail fireworks sales, establishing
two fee levels for fireworks stands and requiring all locations to be current on property taxes.
The Division increased the amount of occupation tax penalty collected. This likely reflects
an increase in the number of businesses falling into delinquency amid economic struggles.

New Initiatives:








The Division continues multiple approaches to the collection of delinquent occupation tax
revenue and is making an effort to work with businesses in that process so they can remain
viable.
The Division is still trying to expand and strengthen partnerships with Neighborhood and
Business Associations to more effectively identify, pursue, and collect occupation tax
revenue. An increase in the number of inquiries regarding the status of a business or
contractor prior to engaging them for work has been observed.
Business License and Building Inspection suspended pairing the renewal mailings for
credentialed contractors because of staff shortages. Rather than using the two renewal
processes that contractors found confusing, the paired mailings addressed both at the same
time, resulting in less confusion and cost savings. Staff expects to repeat the paired mailing
process for 2014.
The Division continues to improve the tracking process of requests for business location
zoning. A more effective administrative follow up is still needed to reduce the number of
businesses failing to register and increase occupation tax revenues.
The Division is in the early stages of developing a streamlined process to guide new
businesses through the necessary applications, approvals and inspections. This guided
approach will be available on the Division’s web page and in hard-copy packets of
information.

Division Overview
Code Enforcement Division
Division Overview:
Code Enforcement engages in educating the public with regard to the minimum housing
standards, the property maintenance standards for both residential and commercial buildings,
as well as the regulations for various zoning uses. In addition, the Code Enforcement Division is
charged with the enforcement of these same standards. In an effort to educate and enforce
these ordinances, the Code Enforcement Division often partners with many other inspection and
enforcement divisions within the Unified Government in an attempt to ensure that the citizens of
Kansas City, Kansas live in a safe and healthy environment. Additionally, Code Enforcement
partners and works with various neighborhood groups and neighborhood business revitalization
organizations to help develop priorities for neighborhoods and the community, to resolve
neighborhood issues by abating crime-inducing blight, and to educate the public about the
resources available and services provided by the Unified Government.
Important Issues:






The Division continues to strive to fill inspector positions so supervisors can carry out their
specific duties rather than covering districts. Specific duties involves working to maintain a
high level of service in the Code Enforcement Division, training new staff, and working to
hire quality employees to replace any vacated positions.
The Division is preparing to move to a new location and is making the necessary plans to
maintain the expected level of service during the transition.
Abandoned homes are a continuing concern for the Division. Staff is participating in the
Abandoned Housing and Neighborhood Task Force in an effort to help bring quality
affordable housing to those who need it, transforming blighted properties into good
neighborhoods, and increasing tax base properties by continuing to address the neglect and
deterioration associated with abandoned and foreclosed properties.

New Initiatives/Goals:





With several new staff members, the Division will be emphasizing in-service training of new
and existing codes, ordinances, and Division policies. Additionally, the Division will continue
to develop ideas that will educate the general public with regard to these ordinances.
The Division is still seeking a means to assist with efforts to address illegal dumping. The
effort currently involves research and documentation of the problem along with the compiling
of current resources. The effort to combat the issue will include public education, staff to
address the illegal dumping, and the possible need of new regulations and stricter penalties
for violators.
The Division will continue to strive to achieve full staffing complement, allowing for a more
thorough and comprehensive education through enforcement in an effort to better serve the
community’s need for cleaner, safer, and healthier neighborhoods. This would also enable
the Inspector Supervisors to quickly respond to high attention situations and to assist the
inspectors with particularly challenging issues.

Division Overview
Rental License and Inspection
Division Overview:
The Rental Licensing Program enforces the Unified Government's ordinances regarding property
maintenance and building codes for residential rental property within the city. The program is in place to
improve the quality of residential rental property and to assist in addressing neighborhood issues that
arise around these properties. Rental Housing is a business and as such is recognized as a business.
The revenue collected from landlord rental licenses funds this program. All residential rental property
must be licensed annually and maintained according to the standards included in the Unified
Government's property maintenance and building codes.

Important Issues:



Inspections need to be made consistently and timely, but due to a shortage of personnel, this
has not been possible in 2012. Efforts are being made to get back on track for 2013/2014.
Rental licensing numbers have increased each year; however, they have gone up
approximately 12% this year. Staff, on the other hand, has remained the same. A request to
hire a new inspector position for Rental License has been submitted to Budget for 2014.

New Initiatives/Goals:
 Mandatory landlord training is being considered and will most likely be brought before the
governing body for consideration sometime in 2013. This will increase the work load for both
inspection staff as well as support staff.
Through a Rental Licensing Subcommittee
(subcommittee of Neighborhood Housing Taskforce), staff should be able to recommend a
landlord training process that will be easy for the landlords to complete and will limit an
immediate burden on staff. However, increased staff will be necessary to accomplish additional
stages of the training program.
 Requiring the use of the crime free addendum in every lease is being considered and will be
most likely be brought before the governing body for consideration sometime in 2013. This
would allow the landlord to take action on a tenant in the event of illegal activity that is
documented through the Police Department. It would also allow action against the rental
license itself if the landlord chooses to ignore the Police and allows illegal activity on the
property. After three notifications, if the landlord does not start eviction proceedings, their rental
license could be revoked.
 Staff has found it to be a challenge to determine or establish a good timeframe for the rotation of
inspections on rental properties. Efforts are being made to inspect multi-unit complexes every
two years, inspect single to five-unit buildings every five years, and handle complaints within 48hours if at all possible. The Division has established a way to ensure that all multi-family units
are on a two-year rotation and are currently looking at three-four units to get them on a fiveyear rotation
 Adding an additional inspector position would help alleviate the workload of increased
inspections due to new initiatives and would, thereby, help keep the inspection schedule on its
rotation. Complaints, currently handled by the inspection supervisor, could be addressed by the
inspectors. As a result, the supervisor would be available to handle more administrative duties,
as well as the training and evaluation of inspection staff. This would also allow the inspector to
be available for landlord training purposes and to help track the landlords who have completed
the training. Current revenues are more than sufficient to support an additional inspector.

Division Overview
Building Inspection

Division Overview:
The Building Inspection Division is responsible for the inspection of buildings for compliance with
building, residential, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and energy codes. The Division also reviews
construction plans and documents and enforces zoning regulations related to new construction.
The purpose of the Building Inspection program is to ensure the public's safety by assuring that
structures are built to a minimum standard and to promote a quality of life through the encouragement
of sound building practices. Staff is responsible for approving plans, issuing all construction permits,
and enforcing mechanical, plumbing, electrical, energy and building safety codes as adopted, using
standard code guidelines. The program provides prompt, efficient, and courteous service to all
developers, homeowners, and businesses when inspecting or evaluating construction plans.
Additionally, staff serves as a general resource to the community on building code requirements and
construction practices and methods.
Important Issues:





Foreclosures continue to create challenges for staff resources; however, the Division continues
to provide services for the rehabilitation of these structures. This requires inspection from staff
to restore the utilities to the vacant homes.
Staffing continues to be an issue. One inspector was lost because of medical issues and the
loss will place a strain on the Division’s inspection response time. The position is currently being
filled; however, it may be six months before the person hired is trained in all areas and able to
function on his own.
New development projects will test the Division’s inspection resources. The following projects
are currently under construction or review: Two 100+ unit apartment complexes, two new
elementary schools with another elementary school to submit plans this spring/summer; the
Cerner II complex; the 39th & Rainbow II project; the Wyandotte Plaza project; General Motors
project; and the continued transformation of the Legends Outlets. Additionally, plans are
scheduled for The Proctor & Gamble addition, a new industrial park in Fairfax, and a new
building for Zeolyst International. Since September of 2013, there has been a significant
increase in the number of single family residential permits being issued.

New Initiatives/Goals:


With the adoption of the 2009 set of codes, including the energy code, staff will continue to work
with our community partners, contractors, developers and designers to train and implement the
new code requirements.

Division Overview

Clearance and Demolition

Division Overview:
The Clearance and Demolition program is a tool to assist the community and neighborhoods through
Code Enforcement by removing structures that are blighted, abandoned, unsafe and structurally
unsound. These structures have been abandoned and pose a nuisance and dangerous conditions. In
many instances, owners cannot be found or they do not have the financial means to pay for the
demolition. Funds are currently derived from three sources: Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) funds, General Fund, and the Fire Insurance Proceeds Fund.
The Fire Insurance Proceeds Fund is established by Kansas State Statute and is a funding tool to
ensure that insured structures significantly damaged by fire, explosion, and windstorm are repaired
accordingly, or are razed to eliminate a nuisance and blight.
Important Issues:





Enforcement by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) of some existing
regulations associated with how CDBG dollars are used is limiting and further eroding the amount
of CDBG funds that can be used for demolition activity. This issue is limiting the Unified
Government’s CDBG demolition funding to approximately $300,000 for 2013, which is a reduction
by approximately 60% of last year’s CDBG demolition budget.
It continues to be a challenge to continually re-prioritize structures slated for demolition due to
changing property conditions, HUD and EPA requirements, restrictions, and increased
responsibilities in the program. Additional resources and/or funding are needed to do an adequate
job in addressing the number of properties now needing to be demolished in our community. This is
especially a concern for commercial structures where CDBG funds generally cannot be used.
The demolition program also assists Public Works/Engineering by removing buildings involved in
Right-of-Way (ROW) projects such as street widening, storm water shed creeks, and re-alignments
through capital projects. These projects are processed accordingly to ensure compliance with
environmental and state historical regulations.
Increases in labor and insurance costs, landfill fees, fuel oil costs, and special landfills for
contaminated materials continue to increase, which all negatively impact the program.

New Initiatives/Goals:





CDBG funding has been substantially cut by HUD, with more cuts expected this year. Since 2006,
the program has been reduced significantly. Since the housing market meltdown, more homes and
structures are being referred for the demolition process than ever. This is primarily due to owners,
banks, and mortgage companies defaulting and leaving the structures unsecured and in continuous
state of decay. Requests for additional funding from sources other than CDBG are being requested
to attempt to make up for the shortfalls.
Include in the demolition bidding process a new electronic internet format being offered through the
Unified Government’s Purchasing Department.

Department Overview
Register of Deeds

Department Overview:
The Register of Deeds serves as custodian and maintains a perpetual, comprehensive set of public
records dating back to the late 1850’s (K.S.A. 19-1204). These include legal documents such as
deeds, mortgages, powers of attorney, subdivision plats, etc.
Important Issues:





The Register of Deeds greatest challenge is to preserve millions of documents recorded in
various formats. Future access to records cannot be guaranteed unless they can be preserved
for as long as needed.
Plan for the use of the Register of Deeds technology resources by developing and scheduling
record preservation and record reformatting projects.
Promote sound preservation practices that address ease of use and archival priorities.
Implement statutory changes, system upgrades, program and procedure evaluation, and staff
development to assure a high level of customer service for our citizens.

Highlights:




Continuation of the records preservation process. Developing and implementing life-cycle
management policies for access and storage of the digital files created from reformatting
projects. These projects are funded under the Register of Deeds capital equipment technology
fund.
There were 19,547 documents and 3,670 mortgages filed in 2012 compared to 17,392
documents and 3,030 mortgages filed in 2011.

New Initiatives:





Register of Deeds forms have been added to the website for public use.
A free property fraud alert is available.
The electronic filing of documents has increased by 30%.
On-going initiative to promote a customer-friendly environment within the office.

Department Overview
Transit Department
Department Overview:
The Unified Government Transit Department provides transportation services for citizens throughout
Kansas City, Kansas. Programs include the public fixed-route transit system, a para-transit system for
persons with disabilities called Dial-A-Ride; and a senior group transportation service. Under Aging
Transit, programs include Meals on Wheels, transit service to nutrition sites, senior medical trips
including dialysis and chemotherapy, and senior grocery shopping. In addition to these services,
Unified Government Transit contracts annually for additional fixed-route bus service which is provided
by the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (The Metro).
Important Issues:
 Federal earmarks for funding bus capital have been eliminated. The new transportation
legislation is Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP 21). The Unified Government
must now try to get buses purchased through the area transportation authority which is the
KCATA. This new process is extremely competitive and favors the big rail projects on the
coasts. Bus capital may have to come from another funding source in the future.
 Petroleum fuel costs continue to be a major concern. Transit’s propane program mentioned
below will help offset our need for petroleum fuel.
 Regional transportation “connectivity” remains a major issue. This will require electronic
fareboxes/automated passenger counters to be installed on Unified Government buses in the
future.
 Federal transit funding continues to diminish sharply. The Congestion Mitigation Air Quality
grant funding will expire in 2013. Job Access Reverse Commute funding has been reduced.
Highlights:
 Implementation of the $10.49 million Federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic
Recovery (T.I.G.E.R.) stimulus grant for capital infrastructure improvements and enhancements
to State Avenue is still in progress. The 7th Street Transit Center is beginning the final phase of
construction. It will open in the summer of 2013. The roof has been constructed on the 47th
Street Transit MetroCenter. Interior finish has begun. The MetroCenter will open in early fall.
 Six brand new transit buses were purchased in the fall of 2012. These new buses are equipped
with bike racks, camera and audio systems, and state-of-the-art wheelchair lifts. Within the last
two years, Unified Government Transit has added thirteen new buses to our fleet.
 The thirteen new transit buses have all been equipped with a propane fuel conversion system.
These alternative fuel systems will save the Unified Government over $100,000 in fuel costs
and reduce harmful emissions to the environment.
 Heart safe “hands only” CPR training was held at the Fleet Center. All Unified Government
Transit employees have been trained in this new CPR “hands only” technique. This new
training could potentially save a life.
Relationship to Board of Commission Goal(s):
 The highlights reflect Commission’s goal of “Creating a transit system that moves people to
work, services, and amenities.”

Department Overview
Urban Planning and Land Use Department
Department Overview:
Urban Planning and Land Use promotes the long-term value and livability of the community by:
administering land use and development ordinances; advises the public, appointed and elected
officials on planning issues; coordinates development review with over 20 departments and
agencies; and provides technical assistance to neighborhoods. The Department is the technical
staff for planning to the Board of Commissioners, City Planning Commission, KCK Landmarks
Commission, and the Board of Zoning Appeals. In addition, staff helps to prepare and
implement the City’s Master Plan, Major Street Plan, and various neighborhood plans.
Important Issues:
 Implementation of private development plans. Occasionally, after a development is built and
approved, the site develops issues related to the original approval. Developing more
effective tools to deal with post-approval issues continues to be important.
 Continuing to implement the City Master Plan through development review and other
mechanisms is important to move the community forward.
 Continued expansion of MAUWI will allow more efficient review and tracking.
 Keeping within our engineering review time frame remains a difficult task due to the ebb and
flow of development applications.
 Review project timeframes and customer service.
.
Highlights:
 Completed application process and successfully entered the Community Rating Service
(CRS) program at the highest level in Kansas or Missouri which gives citizens up to a 20%
discount
on
flood
insurance.
http://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insuranceprogram/national-flood-insurance-program-community-rating-system
 Completed Phase 1 of the Strawberry Hill Historic Survey of Structures.
http://www.wycokck.org/InternetDept.aspx?id=33694
 Completed the city’s first Sidewalk and Trail Master Plan including a condition survey of all
existing sidewalks. http://www.wycokck.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=35762 and
http://www.wycokck.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=35761
 Assisted in developing two new USD 500 schools meeting overlay zone standards. Mark
Twain and Hazel Grove will be outstanding community assets. Mark Twain also met local,
State and Federal Historic Review Standards.
New Initiatives:
 Electronic plan review will be fully implemented by engineers and planners involved in the
development process. They will utilize digital review to expedite the review process and
provide better comments to assist applicants in future submissions.
 Staff will be working to finish a new website in conjunction with the Wyandotte Economic
Development Council (WYEDC). This site will cover all aspects of development from
planning and zoning, incentives, and building permits. Staff continues working with the
Neighborhood Resource Center (NRC) and the Wyandotte Economic Development Council
(WYEDC) on this new web application.
 Establish base line customer service standards and set goals to improve our customer
service.

Division Overview

 
Public Works/Engineering Division
Division Overview:
The Engineering Division is responsible for the engineering design and construction supervision of
street, bridge, traffic signal, storm sewer, and sanitary sewer infrastructure projects. The projects
include new facilities, major maintenance of existing infrastructure, and emergency repairs of public
facilities as necessary.
Important Issues:




Deferred maintenance of pavements, sewers, signals and sidewalks is creating an ever increasing
back-log of need. This budget continues to propose a steady restoration of funding levels for
street maintenance, priority bridge repairs, and traffic signal replacements.
Signing of the partial consent decree with EPA impacts many aspects of sanitary and storm
related projects and operations.
2013 is the first year under the newest five-year Stormwater Management Program, with more
rigorous federal mandates for pollution prevention, internal programs and training, and
development requirements.

Highlights:









$2.0 Million in “Commissioner Neighborhood Infrastructure Projects” (“CNIP”) will be under
construction this construction season, including sidewalks, park improvements, recreation centers,
and drainage upgrades.
State Avenue upgrades are underway from 73rd Street to 94th Street, supported in part by federal
funds.
Bike lanes on Southwest Boulevard will be opened from Iowa to 10th Street, with further expansion
through 2017 as part of several projects.
Major construction, as part of the Turkey Creek Drainage Improvements, is underway, including
the Cherokee Interceptor and Mill Street Bridge.
Traffic signals are being replaced at Fairfax and Stanley and along State Avenue.
A number of wastewater capital projects will be underway, including Kaw Point Wastewater Plant
Disinfection Unit and Dewatering Facility, Jersey Creek Sewer System Repairs, and Brush Creek
Pump Station.
Sidewalks are being constructed around Grant and Douglass Elementary as part of the “Safe
Routes to Schools” program.
Major bridge repairs at Shawnee Avenue and Riverview Avenue and 65th Street over Turner
Diagonal will be completed in 2013.

New Initiatives:



Design is underway on a major street renewal project along Merriam Lane and at 55th and 72nd
Street intersections along Leavenworth Road.
With the hiring of a full-time County Surveyor, staff is implementing new processes to better
monitor and assist private development projects while under construction. This includes enhanced
erosion and sediment control measures.

Division Overview
Public Works/Street Division

Division Overview:
The Street Division is responsible for the maintenance, pavement repair, right-of-way mowing,
pavement marking, traffic sign maintenance, snow removal, and right-of-way clean-up for over 1950
lane miles of improved roadway. The Street Division also has responsibility for cleaning up illegal
dumping throughout the county. The Street Division also responds to public emergencies, storm debris
clean-up, and special events as needed.

Important Issues:


Despite budget reductions, the Street Division in 2012 and the winter of 2012-2013
accomplished the following:
o Placed over 3,000 tons of asphalt street repairs
o Removed 1,200 cubic yards of street cleaning debris
o Mowed on a regular basis:
 More than 60 acres of right-of-way
 More than 800 vacant lots
 More than 150 Unified Government facilities
 Significant late snows (20+ inches in six days) will have a serious budget impact as the Division:
o Plowed more than 1,950 miles four times in six days moving almost two feet of snow.
o Treated more than 1,950 miles with salt and sand.
o Expended over $300,000 in labor, materials and fuel responding to these storms.
 Responded to numerous other storm events, removing hundreds of downed trees, limbs and
debris that wind and thunderstorms placed in right-of-ways or in the street.
 Cleaned more than 60 illegal dump sites.
 Collected more than 50,000 illegally dumped tires.
 The Quick Response Team cleaned and restored over 1,500 graffiti locations.
.
Highlights:




Despite the hot dry conditions in 2012, the Street Division was able to increase asphalt street
repairs by 20%.
The restoration of the Quick Response Trash Team in 2012 allowed the Division to respond
more quickly to illegal dumping, trash, graffiti, and mowing complaints.
Participating in the Fleets Division’s fuel reduction plan, the Streets Division now has three
propane vehicles and will have more in the future.

2013 Amended and 2014 Operating Budget

Division Overview

Public Works/Centralized Fleet Maintenance
Division Overview:
Fleet Services is responsible for the maintenance and procurement of all Unified Government vehicles,
including EMS units, but excluding fire apparatus. This unit is a complete service provider that also
maintains a record of vehicle repairs, fuel usage, and parts inventory. Fleet Services also maintains an
inventory of all Unified Government equipment, except for fire apparatus.
Important Issues:





Responsible for a diverse fleet that exceeds 1200 vehicular units.
The Fleet Maintenance Division has adopted a green program for the fleet. It involves vehicle
replacement, fuel, and vehicle selection.
The fluctuation in gas prices continues to impact the cost of operating the fleet.
Develop a fuel reduction strategy across the entire Unified Government fleet.

Highlights:





As a result of budget problems since 2008, all departments are significantly behind in their
respective vehicle replacement schedule. This in turn causes the Fleet Services operational
budget and parts inventory to increase as much as 10-15%.
Initiated a propane gas program in the Transit Department buses. Through the use of grants
and the propane vendor, a savings of over $100,000 will be achieved. The results are so
encouraging that staff is working with the propane company to convert more vehicles to the fuel.
Seven buses, two flare trucks, and one dump truck are currently running on propane. Staff
hopes to double this amount.
Procurement of new police vehicles which are smaller and equipped with more economical
engines. The Ford Crown Victoria is no longer in production, so the Police Department has
selected the Ford Explorer as the replacement. Twenty-six units were procured in 2013. Forty
are planned for 2014. All of the Explorers are equipped with the 6-cylinder eco-boost that is
more fuel efficient.

New Initiatives:


The principal initiative for the Fleets Division is the expansion of the alternative fuels and the
procurement of right sized vehicles. Gas prices fluctuate continually but are still in excess of
past budget cycles.

Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas
2013 Amended and 2014 Operating Budget

Division Overview
 

Water Pollution Control Division
Division Overview:
The Water Pollution Control Division is charged with the responsibility of maintaining five
wastewater treatment plants, eighty-three pump stations, and nine flood pump stations, as well
as over eleven hundred miles of sanitary and storm sewers. The Division is required to meet
Federal and State regulatory compliance with wastewater plant effluent, solids disposal, air
quality emissions from its incinerators, as well as ongoing maintenance, repair, and inspection
of all sanitary/storm sewers.
Important issues:




The disinfection by ultra violet light of the Kaw Point Plant effluent is underway. The goal
is to have the plant effluent disinfected by the end of 2014 in order to meet new
regulatory guidelines in the Kaw Point National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit.
The Unified Government (UG) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) settled on a
“Partial Consent Decree” this year. The UG will now have until 2016 to perform an indepth analysis of the most cost-effective means and methods to reduce the total number
of permitted combined sewer overflows (CSO) per year. The UG has hired several
engineering firms to begin the studies in the sewer system to develop an integrated
overflow control plan that will be negotiated between the UG and EPA in the future.

Highlights:




A solids master plan was done by Black & Veatch engineers in 2012. The study showed
that incineration of sewage sludge solids would not be cost effective for the long-term
future. A new solids dewatering facility project will be underway sometime in 2013 to
allow the disposal of sludge solids to a landfill. The goal is to begin using this new facility
before 2016 when new emission limits are imposed on all sewage sludge incinerators
across the nation.
The UG selected the firm of Burns & McDonnell engineering in 2012 to help facilitate the
negotiations and provide EPA with the necessary information that allowed the UG to
settle the Partial Consent Decree. This information consisted of financial data, as well as
the necessary detailed steps of analysis that are needed to assemble an affordable
integrated overflow control plan that will be submitted to EPA.

New Initiatives:




A grease reduction program has been undertaken by the Water Pollution Control
Division for 2013. The goal of the program is to prevent any grease-related problems in
the sewer system by monitoring and tracking all grease that is discharged from food
service facilities in Kansas City, Kansas, and providing education and instruction for
proper disposal methods for food-related grease.
A new Collection System Manager position was created in the Water Pollution Control
Division in 2012. This position will develop a new management program for the sewer
collection system. This effort is in response to the recent Consent Agreement with EPA.

Division Overview

Public Works/Solid Waste Division
Division Overview:
The Solid Waste Division manages and administers all programs related to solid waste including
weekly trash disposal, weekly curbside recycling, residential household hazardous waste collection,
and disposal. Additionally, staff works to develop green activities and clean-ups. Earth Day, E-waste
collection events, graffiti removal, and neighborhood group activities are part of the waste reduction
effort.
Important Issues:





The long-term solid waste contract has been extended for twenty more years and will continue
to provide unlimited trash collection and disposal service for a great price, including yard waste.
Reduction of waste-stream within the county through recycling and yard waste programs.
Continued Public Works response to Kansas Department of Health & Environment (KDHE)
regarding John Garland Park Landfill.
The disposal of illegally dumped tires continues to be a major problem. Annual cost is $75,000.

Highlights:





Solid waste collection and disposal charge is one of the lowest in the metropolitan area.
Staff will recommend that the issue of illegal tire disposal be part of the legislative package.
The return of Quick Response Trash Team was re-staffed in the spring of 2012 and will assist in
the mowing, dumpsite clean-ups, and neighborhood projects.
Garland Park environmental studies have been completed recently. They include two air
monitoring measurements, one ground analysis, and the reuse plan. As a result of these
efforts, Garland Park has been declared safe for use. The new plan outlines uses that comply
with site restrictions.

New Initiatives:






With curbside recycling available to all residents of the City as part of their weekly trash
collection and with the expansion of the private sector providing drop-off sites for glass, this
budget recommends closing the recycling drop-off center. The household hazardous waste will
remain open.
The issue of yard waste recycling is unsettled because of the Kansas law which pre-empts local
laws regarding Deffenbaugh’s landfill.
The emerald ash borer has been found in Wyandotte County. This resulted in a Department of
Agriculture quarantine of ash wood. It is anticipated that this will ultimately kill many ash trees in
our community.
John Garland Park’s reuse plan improvements include extensive fence installation and
replacement. The exterior fence will be replaced. The gas wells will be fenced to protect them.
New entrances in the south and west will feature an open concept with bollards replacing gates
which will improve access. The shelter has been repaired and re-stained. A walking trail will
meander around the interior of the fence line. It will consist of an easily walkable aggregate. A
soccer and ball field will be arranged in the center of the park. The intent of the improvements
is to return the park to the neighborhood.

Department Overview
Buildings and Logistics

Department Overview:
The Buildings and Logistics Department provides a safe and comfortable workplace for Unified
Government employees, along with convenience for citizens who visit government buildings. This
Department oversees and performs maintenance for Unified Government-owned and operated
facilities. This includes police facilities, fire stations, recreation centers, Election Office, Annex,
Neighborhood Resource Center, Health Department, Criminal Justice Complex, Juvenile Detention,
Court Services Building, McDowell Plaza Office Building, Memorial Hall, and Courthouse.
Important Issues:




With the reestablishment of the Public Building Commission, a procedure and prioritization
system needs to be developed for capital improvement projects.
A centralized receiving depot for mail and general deliveries needs to be established to create a
more safe and effective monitoring of incoming items and material.
With the transfer of management of the Public Levee, the Unified Government’s free storage
capacity has been drastically reduced. In the past, the Public Levee supplied free storage
space for Unified Government facilities. With the new levee management, the Unified
Government will need to program 50 to 100,000 square feet in the future.

Highlights:







State Historical Tax Credits (SHTC), 2012-2013 marked another year that the Buildings and
Logistics Department applied and received approval for $287,500 in state historical tax credits
for eligible CMIP projects. The additional tax credits will bring our program to over $1,447,500
in credits for the last seven years.
Authorization has been received from the State Historical Society to replace the windows at Fire
Headquarters with new energy efficient windows.
The annual roof program will be continued by replacing the roofs on three fire stations.
City Hall elevators will have a mechanical and cab upgrade beginning mid-year. The project will
take approximately six months to complete.
Under the New Energy Conservation and Management Program Pilot, the Unified Government
completed the first energy conservation project for the Court Services facility in 2012. Under
this program, the Unified Government is currently doing upgrades to City Hall. The majority of
the work will be in 2013.

New Initiatives:



A new parking garage study and assessment program to help identify critical structural and
nonstructural items with our major parking garages was completed in 2012 and Phase One of
critical repairs is being implemented on Parking Lot “C.”
Restructuring of janitorial services is proposed to provide management and a cost-effective
delivery of service to the Unified Government.

Division Overview
Security Division
Division Overview:
The Security Division provides daily officer security in ten Unified Government buildings. Four of the
buildings are equipped with metal detectors and two have x-ray equipment. All buildings have security
during regular business hours with the exception of the Neighborhood Resource Center, which is
manned only during hearings. After business hours the Municipal Office Building provides security
using manned camera surveillance twenty-four hours per day, seven days a week. The security
officers assigned to the Municipal Office Building also monitor all elevator emergency calls during and
after business hours. The security officers provide a vital role in protecting the government’s patrons,
employees, and property. In most cases, the security officers are the first contact with the public when
citizens enter a Unified Government building. The Security Division is committed to providing quality
security services and, at the same time, strives to serve in a public relations and information-providing
capacity for the Unified Government.
Important Issues:





To prepare and coordinate with the Sheriff’s Department and Police Department concerning the
Unified Government’s response to the newly passed legislation for conceal and carry.
Special requests and meetings continue to require additional security support, mainly after
hours; however, some hearings require extra security during business hours.
It is recommended that the Unified Government consider improved surveillance cameras, x-ray
machines, and metal detectors in all of the buildings to monitor the activities in these high-traffic
public facilities. Currently, budget concerns do not allow state-of-the-art equipment to be at all
stations.

Highlights:





In 2012 846,187 people passed through the Unified Government’s metal detectors as is
evidenced by the following counts:
Municipal Office Building
281,972
Courthouse
321,960
Justice Complex
70,721
Court Services Building
171,534
The following buildings have security presence but are not equipped with metal detectors:
Public Health Department, Willa Gill Center, Annex, Election Office and the Neighborhood
Resource Center.
New Area Agency on Aging facilities are scheduled to come open in the fall of 2013.

New Initiatives:




To expeditiously replace all officers who leave the Security Division to ensure full coverage of all
critical and high-use public facilities.
To transition to all Part A and FTE positions only. The goal is to provide maximum cover and
flexibility of security staff.
Special requests and after-hour meetings continue to require additional security support. Extra
security is requested from the Appraiser’s Office during Appeal Hearings.

Division Overview

Parking Control
Division Overview:
The Parking Control Division is responsible for the enforcement of city parking ordinances, the sale and
assignment of monthly parking to Unified Government employees and area businesses, as well as
oversees the area school crossing guard program. Parking Control Officers patrol designated areas
within the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, which includes Unified
Government parking facilities, parking meters, and on-street parking in highly dense and populated
areas of the city.
The Parking Control Division is committed to building collaborative partnerships with area businesses
and organizations to enhance and improve the downtown parking environment.
Important Issues:





Provide parking control enforcement during downtown business hours.
Respond to complaints and inquiries in a timely and efficient manner.
Supervise and maintain the school crossing guard program according to Kansas State
guidelines.
Handle new requests for parking and the re-assignment of parking in a fair, orderly, and timely
manner.

Highlights:






Worked closely with the Hilton Garden Inn to arrange for the honor boxes located at 500
Minnesota and 500 Armstrong to be covered due to large conventions.
During the Black History Celebration at the Reardon Center, our Parking Control officers
assisted in parking and traffic control.
In April of 2012, at the request of Mayor Reardon, the parking attendants directed event
participants to the proper location for the Wyandotte County Scholars Day event.
In November of 2012, our Parking Control officers assisted in the Mayor’s ChristmasTree
lighting by patrolling and monitoring the city-owned parking lots.
The honor boxes located at 500 Minnesota and 500 Armstrong have been covered indefinitely
to provide free parking.

New Initiatives:




In the process of working with the Building and Logistics Department to install a “Client Bridge”
in Lot “A”, which is a wireless connect between city hall and parking lot “A”. This will ensure a
stable connection, which will save the Unified Government money in the near future.
Additionally, this would allow Scan Net, our parking lot monitoring system, to run more efficiently
and effectively.
Parking Control is currently working with the Public Works Department to install speed bumps in
parking lot “4” to ensure vehicles coming off the viaduct are traveling at a safe speed.

CMIP Policy
_____________________________________________________________________________________ 

The Capital Maintenance Improvement Program (CMIP) of the UG is a long-term
planning tool intended to allow for prioritization, financing, coordination, and timely
technical design and application of projects and equipment to better serve the citizens.
The CMIP is a 5-year plan of capital project improvements and equipment needs. Each
year, this document is updated to represent the next five-year window. Projects
completed or scheduled to be completed by the end of the fiscal year – will drop from
the document. New projects will be added and other previously – scheduled projects
may be reprioritized.
Improvements can include construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or maintenance of
a capital asset and equipment needs can include replacement, upgrade or purchase of
new equipment. Capital projects and equipment are usually defined as one with a cost
estimate greater than $5,000 and may require engineering support or consulting
engineering services to evaluate, design, and prepare project documents. The capital
program may include maintenance projects that result in new fixed assets. Equipment
projects $5,000 and above are also authorized in the capital plan.
Process for including an item in the CMIP:


CMIP requests are submitted to the Finance Department by
-Department request in response to need in writing (form attached)
-Public request identified at a public hearing or direct contact with the
department
-Commission requests for improvement need in the district



Administrative Review – department
projects/equipment submitted



Planning Commission Review – commission meeting held for project review and
comment



UG Mayor & Commission Review – project and equipment committee meetings
are held for commissioners to review and comment on items that have been
submitted

and

Once finalized the CMIP Project and Equipment lists are submitted to the entire
commission for approval during the budget process.

2013 – 2018 Capital Maintenance Improvement Program (CMIP)

CMIP Policy
_____________________________________________________________________________________ 

This CMIP is directly linked to the budget process, land-use planning, facility plan
implementation, coordination with the state, county, and other local municipalities, and
the ongoing direction of the UG leaders.
The operating budget includes capital projects and equipment that are generally of a
recurring nature and are appropriated for one year only. Year to year changes for
annual or reoccurring projects represent incremental variances in the cost of doing
business.
Projects that result in procurement or construction of major physical assets for the UG
are aligned with the governments financial forecast. Resources for the capital plan can
come from the same resources as the operating budget, but the more costly projects
are funded by bond and temporary note financing. Also, the capital plan is a forecasting
device intended to assist management and is not intended to appropriate funds.
The first year of the adopted capital plan will be the capital budget for that fiscal year.
UG expenditures in the CMIP must equal the estimated resources available for capital
spending and weigh the full costs of proposed projects in relation to funding sources.
Capital and equipment projects should be funded on a Pay-as-you-go project (cash)
basis and/or debt financing (lease 3-10 years, general obligation bonds 15-20 years).
Periodic status reports will be presented to the UG Mayor, commissioners and staff to
share project progress and identify significant issues associated with a project.
Upon completion of a capital project, any remaining appropriated funds for the project
will revert to the fund balance of the funding source.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES (Adopted 5/03/12)
Purpose
To set forth the general public policy objectives of the Unified Government as relates to
fund balance policy. The overlying goal of this policy is to ensure that there will be
adequate liquid resources to serve as a financial cushion against the potential shock of
unanticipated circumstances and events.
Authority
The Board of Commissioners is the authoritative Governing Body of the Unified
Government. The Governing Body may approve the use of budgeted reserves in the
case of emergency events, or conditions that result in unanticipated expenditure
requirements or revenue fluctuations within a fiscal year, or to take advantage of an
extraordinary opportunity.
Minimum Fund Balance
It shall be the goal of the Unified Government to maintain a minimum fund balance in
the general fund of 10% of expenditures.
In addition, it shall be the goal of the Unified Government to maintain fund balances of
certain other fund balances in a given range as follows:
a. Special Revenue Funds
 Court Trustee
 Elections
 Health Department
 Jail Commissary
 Library
 Mental Health
 Mental Retardation
 Register of Deeds Technology
 Special Sales Tax 2010

Fund Balance Classification
The Unified Government desires to establish a fund balance classification policy
consistent with the needs of the Unified Government, and in a manner consistent with
governmental accounting standards. The following classifications serve to enhance the
usefulness of fund balance information:
a. Non-spendable Balance
Assets legally or contractually required to be maintained, or are not in
spendable form. Such constraint is binding until the legal requirement is
repealed or the amounts become spendable.
b. Restricted Balance
Assets with externally imposed constraints, such as those mandated by
creditors, grantors and contributors, or laws and regulations. Such
constraint is binding unless modified or rescinded by the applicable
external body, laws, or regulations.
a. Unrestricted Fund Balance
1.Committed
Assets with a purpose formally imposed by resolution by the Governing
Body of the Unified Government, binding unless modified or rescinded
by the Governing Body.
1. Assigned
Assets constrained by the government’s intent as expressed by the
Governing Body, County Administrator or designee. Encumbrances
shall be considered as assigned, unless they specifically meet the
requirements to be committed or restricted.
a. Unassigned
All amounts not included in other fund balance classifications. The
general fund shall be the only fund to report positive unassigned fund
balance. All other governmental funds may report negative unassigned
fund balance.
It shall be the policy to reduce restricted fund balance first, followed by unrestricted fund
balance. For unrestricted fund balance, committed amounts should be reduced first,
followed by assigned amounts, followed by unassigned amounts.
Compliance with this section will be reviewed in conjunction with the annual budget
process.

312

LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN POLICY
The UG’s financial forecast involves incorporating the Commissioner’s vision, values,
goals and strategies to provide for the community’s highest priority needs.
The UG prepares an annual long-term financial plan as a fundamental element of the
budget process. The purpose of the forecast is to evaluate current and future fiscal
conditions to guide policy and programmatic decisions; attain financial sustainability;
ensure the UG has sufficient long term information to guide financial decisions; has
sufficient resources to provide the core programs and services the community expects;
and ensure potential risks to on-going operations are identified in the long term financial
planning process and communicated on a regular basis.
In addition, the financial plan will be maintain long-term fiscal solvency by identifying
significant future expenses, liabilities, problems/challenges and identify strategies to
address potential issues.
A financial forecast is a fiscal management tool that presents estimated information
based on current and projected financial conditions to identify future revenue and
expenditure trends that may have an immediate or long-term influence on UG policies,
strategic goals, or community services. The forecast assists in the formation of
decisions that exercise fiscal discipline and deliver essential community services as an
integral part of the annual budgeting process.
Each year, UG staff shall develop a 5-year forecast of general and debt service fund of
the operating and capital expenditures. In addition, the UG will prepare a 5-year CMIP
plan that will also be adopted with this forecast. The financial forecast will be updated
prior to the start of the annual budget process and strive for balanced position in each
of the five years. As part of the budget message, the County Administrator will advise
the Commission of potential long-term positive and adverse trends along with his
analysis of the trends.
The financial forecast will consider, but not be limited to, an analysis that may include
such factors as:
Revenue
a. Casino related revenue
b. Franchise and utility payment in lieu of tax
c. Interest rate forecast
d. Property valuation
e. Retail sales activity
f. STAR Bond district revenues

313

Expense
a. Capital improvement projects 5-year plan
b. Fuel and utility cost trends
c. Future pension obligations, including KPERS/OPEB liabilities
d. Insurance/liability, including employee, workers compensation, and property
e. Schedule of debt payments
f. Union contracts
Government Actions
a. Federal and State mandates/legislation
b. Status of intergovernmental grants
Socio-economic
a. Development trends
b. Residential and socio-economic trends
The UG estimates included in the financial forecast are based on estimates formulated
through the utilization of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Historical revenues
and expenditures are analyzed primarily through trend analysis.
This policy will be reviewed on an annual basis.

314

REVENUE & USER FEE POLICY
Diversification and Stabilization: The goal of Unified Government is to maintain
diverse and stable revenue sources. We recognize the way to do that includes property
tax, sales tax, and franchise or payment in-lieu of tax (primary revenue sources).
Nearly 60% of revenue received by the UG is from the three sources stated above.
Equity: The UG will maintain a sound, consistent, and equitable ad valorem property
tax assessment program. Industry may be exempt from property tax abatement and are
assessed on all users of water and electric services. Therefore, if a property owner in
exempt from property taxes, they pay their equitable share of PILOT payment.
Relation to Economic Development: Tax incentives will be provided to encourage
reinvestment to both residential and commercial sectors that stimulate near growth and
future financial economic impact to the community.
Delinquent Revenue and Collections: The UG remains vigilant and aggressive in
collecting delinquent property taxes in order to achieve year-end account balance.
Non-recurring Revenues: Non-recurring revenues are not used towards funding
yearly/ongoing programs.
Capital investment towards fund balance is a more
appropriate use of the funds.
Forecasting Philosophy: The UG takes a conservative forecasting approach in
projecting revenues. Forecasting of revenues should consider prior year trends and
current economic conditions. Additionally, revenue forecasting revenue should be
monitored on an ongoing basis and adjusted if necessary. The UG’s financial plan of
government should be for the general and debt service funds.
New Revenues: New revenues will be evaluated in terms of their fairness, economic
impact and cost.

315

EXPENDITURE POLICY
Funding Operations: The primary goal of the Unified Government should be to offer
core services as efficiently as possible. The Unified Government recognizes that to
provide its core services in an era of declining revenues and increased costs, taxes
might have to increase. As part of the assessed maintenance, the UG adopts a Capital
Maintenance Improvement Program for the next 5-years. Equipment and maintenance to be
funded over 5-year period with consideration to target expense levels for current year and debt
funded projects. Grants will not be used to fill positions for the long-term, but based on the
grant funded positions. If the grant concludes, the UG will evaluate the services and position for
continuation.

Personnel Compensation: The UG recognizes that personnel represent the greatest
cost of expense category. All employees will be treated in a fair manner. UG provides
compensation package that attracts and retains quality employees and are competitive
in the public sector. Funding will be maintained to fund the approved positions and
provide merit increases. Staff positions filled using grants approved by the commission
should not exceed the authorized level indicated in the funding personnel inventory.
The UG will consider the pay-out before filling vacant positions. Overtime will be
approved by department administrators before used. Because the largest expense in
the Unified Government is related to employee pay and benefits, the Commission
recognizes that reduction in those areas might be necessary to minimize the tax burden.
Funding Non-Current Liabilities: Asset maintenance and replacement Capital
improvement tax dollars should be strategically invested to support the community
vision.
Pensions & OPEBs: The UG recognize pension/OPEB liability increases as a
significant future liability. It is important to review policies to minimize future cost
impacts.
Efficiency and Equity: Expenditures must be made to have the most impact. Value in
providing services will evaluate most effective cost efficient way to provide the service.
The UG will consider equally the merits of public or private workers for any given
service.

316

DEBT POLICY
The UG Debt Policy sets forth comprehensive guidelines for the issuance and
repayment of debt. The UG issues debt primarily as a tool to finance large capital
investments that cannot be funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.
The UG will not issue long-term debt to finance current operations and maintain
conservative financial policies to assure strong financial sustainability both in the shortand long-term.
The UG is committed to systematic capital planning and
intergovernmental cooperation and coordination.
The UG is constantly working to improve its financial policies, budgets, forecasts, and
financial health by:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Maintaining the UG’s bond rating
Access to cost effective borrowing
Maintaining full and complete repayment of debt
Establishing criteria that will protect the UG’s financial integrity
Obtaining financing only when necessary
Securing the most favorable interest rate
Allowing for financial flexibility are important objectives of the financial policies

Debt financing, which includes general obligation bonds, special assessment bonds,
revenue bonds, temporary notes, lease/purchase agreements, and other obligations
permitted to be issued, will be issued in accordance with all applicable federal and state
laws governing the issuance of public debt. Additionally, the UG will maintain full and
complete financial disclosure and reporting systems.
The policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the County Administrator and
Finance Department and any substantive modifications made to the policy must be
approved by the Commission.
Debt Issuance factors the UG will consider are:
•
•
•
•
•

2013-2014 target for general obligation support for new debt is $13-$14 million
Current bond ratings with the goal to maintain UG’s AA-rating from Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s
Debt should not exceed beyond asset life
Enterprise Funds (Sewer, Storm-water, EMS, Golf Course & Public Levy) should
support debt issuance
Debt should not be used for annual capital expenditures unless deemed a high
priority by the UG Commission

317

•
•
•
•

General obligation backing should be used for essential government services or
projects with an asset life of 5-years or greater
Economic development and Tax Increment Financing (TIF) should be supported
by project revenues, unless otherwise approved by the Commission
Issuance of debt should be consistent with the UG’s financial forecast
The UG will make a determination if the debt should be issued on either
city/county basis.

Debt Restrictions and conditions supporting debt issuance include:
•
•
•
•
•

The UG will not burden or strain government services by issuing long-term debt
to finance current operations
UG debt financing should not exceed beyond asset life
The amount of outstanding debt cannot exceed 30% of the counties assessed
valuation, per Kansas State Statute
The size of bond issuance should consider bond markets
The UG will use temporary note financing to complete projects before entering
into long-term financial obligations unless final project costs and timelines are
established

The UG will use the following criteria to evaluate pay-as-you-go versus long-term
debt financing in funding capital improvements. Factors favoring pay-as-you-go
financing for projects include:
•
•
•
•

Projects can be funded using available revenues
Available revenues meet the project timeframe for completion
UG debt levels negatively impacting credit rating
Unstable market conditions

Factors favoring long-term debt financing for projects include:
•
•
•
•

Interest rates and debt financing demand are favorable for the UG
Insufficient funding for mandated federal and state projects
Insufficient funding for an immediately required project
Project life is 5-years or longer

Financial Limitations established by the UG include:
•
•
•

Annual debt service payments, excluding Enterprise Funds, are targeted at $23$25 million
General obligation supported debt should not exceed 15% of general
expenditures and should not exceed 15% of tax levy operating funds
The UG will follow Kansas Statutes setting financial debt limitations

318

•

The UG will examine and consider other indicators, such as per capita and net
direct debt as measures of the community’s ability to support debt

Debt Structuring will be for the shortest period possible and match project cash flows,
minimize the impact on future property tax levies, and maintain a relatively rapid
payment of principle.
•
•
•
•
•
•

Debt schedules are structured for 20-years, unless the asset life is less
UG general obligation bonds will be amortized on a level principle basis to extent
practical, and revenue bonds will be amortized on a level debt service basis to
the extent practical considering the forecasted available pledged revenues
Enterprise funds will transfer their debt obligations to debt service fund if
expected projects are financed using general obligation authority
Credit enhancements may be used if the cost of enhancements will result in a net
decrease in borrowing costs or otherwise provide significant benefits, such as
bond insurance
The UG will in most debt financing include call options to achieve interest savings
by potentially refunding bonds early
Capitalization of interest is an appropriate method to financing that allows the
asset to be built without the need for idle funds to pay interest on debt before the
revenue stream from the asset becomes available. Capitalization of interest may
be an important tool moving development projects forward

Debt Issuance Process for long-term financing will comply with all federal, state and
local legal requirements; Commissioners and Economic Development and Finance
Committee approval; and analyze the long-term affordability of debt and financial
impacts to the UG.
•
•
•
•

The UG shall seek to issue its general or revenue bond obligations in a
competitive sale unless it’s determined by the Chief Financial Officer that such a
sale method will not produce the best results
If competitive bids are received unsatisfactory to the UG, it may, at the advice of
the Chief Financial Officer enter to negotiation for the sale of the bonds
When a negotiated sale process is determined to be in the best interest of the
UG, the UG will use a competitive process to select its investment banking team
The UG preferred method of sale is through a public offering and may use a
private offering under special circumstances

Considerations for a negotiated sale include:
•
•

Market interest rate timing
Special obligation/development financing by project revenues

319

•

Financing time schedule

The UG will use professional service providers to assist in authorization, structure
and market debt obligations. The outside professionals include financial advisor,
bond counsel, underwriter, bank trustee, and paying agent/registrar. If special
circumstances exist, the CFO is will engage consultants directly through the
issuance process.
The process for selection of the professional service provider will be competitive and
utilize the following criteria:
•
•
•

Submit a formal request for proposal to allow the UG to evaluate and compare
services
The UG will limit conflict of interest by minimizing the involvement of the
underwriter counsel
Selected based on experience, meeting all necessary tasks in a timely manner
and lacks the potential for conflicts of interest

The UG recognize credit ratings are an integral part of debt financing.
Debt issued by the UG will be managed and monitored by the Chief Financial Officer.
•
•
•

Investment Bond Proceeds – The Cash Management and Investment Policy and
Procedure will be followed.
Compliance Practices – the UG has implemented a Tax-Exempt Financing
Compliance Policy and Procedure. The policy includes arbitrage monitoring and
filing.
Bond Refunds – The UG will consider the refunding debt to accomplish one or
more of the following objectives:
-

•

ARTICLE II
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Section 2.1. Purpose of Compliance Procedure.
The Issuer uses
Governmental Tax-Exempt Bonds to fund Costs of Project Facilities and uses Conduit
Tax-Exempt Bonds and loans or otherwise makes the proceeds available to Conduit
Users to fund Costs of Project Facilities. The Issuer understands that in exchange for
the right to issue Tax-Exempt Bonds at favorable interest rates and terms, the Code and
related regulations impose ongoing requirements related to the proceeds of the TaxExempt Bonds and the Project Facility financed by the Tax-Exempt Bonds. These
requirements focus on the investment, use and expenditure of proceeds of the TaxExempt Bonds and related funds as well as restrictions on the use of the Project
Facility.
The Issuer recognizes that the IRS has stated that all issuers of Tax-Exempt
Bonds should have a separate written policy and procedure regarding ongoing
compliance with the federal tax requirements for Tax-Exempt Bonds.
The Issuer is committed to full compliance with the tax-exempt bond
requirements for all of its outstanding and future tax-exempt financings. This
Compliance Procedure is adopted by the Governing Body to comply with the IRS
directive and to improve tax compliance and documentation. Since the Conduit User for
each Conduit Tax-Exempt Bond issue is primarily responsible for the expenditure and
investment of its Conduit Tax-Exempt Bonds and the use of the Financed Assets and
the Project Facility, this Compliance Policy provides that the Conduit User will assume
substantially all obligations related to post-issuance tax compliance for Conduit TaxExempt Bonds issued for its benefit.
Section 2.2. Scope of Compliance Procedure; Conflicts. This Compliance
Procedure applies to all Tax-Exempt Bonds currently outstanding and all Tax-Exempt
Bonds issued in the future. If the provisions of this Compliance Procedure conflict with
a Tax Compliance Agreement or any other specific written instructions of Bond Counsel,
the terms of the Tax Compliance Agreement or specific written instructions of Bond
Counsel will supersede and govern in lieu of this Compliance Procedure. Any exception
to this Compliance Procedure required by Bond Counsel as part of a future issue of
Tax-Exempt Bonds will be incorporated in the Tax Compliance Agreement for the future

327

issue. Any requirements imposed on the Issuer in the Tax Compliance Agreement, will
be noted by the Bond Compliance Officer and incorporated into the Annual Compliance
Checklist.
Section 2.3. Amendments and Publication of Compliance Procedure. This
Compliance Procedure may be amended from time-to-time by the Governing Body.
Copies of this Compliance Procedure and any amendments will be included in the
permanent records of the Issuer.

of this Compliance Procedure, the Bond Compliance Officer will request each Conduit
User to confirm annually in writing its compliance with the terms of the Tax Compliance

329

Agreement for the Conduit Tax-Exempt Bond issue. Where possible, the Bond
Compliance Officer will combine this certification request with other disclosures the
Conduit User regularly provides to the Trustee (such as ongoing continuing disclosure).
Certifications completed by the Conduit User will be retained by the Bond Compliance
Officer.
Section 5.5. Correcting Prior Deficiencies in Compliance. In the event a
Conduit User informs the Bond Compliance Officer of a deficiency in compliance with a
Tax Compliance Agreement for an outstanding Conduit Tax-Exempt Bond listed on
Exhibit A-2, the Bond Compliance Officer will direct the Conduit User to follow the
procedures described in Treasury Regulations or the Tax-Exempt Bonds Voluntary

LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Foster an environment in which small and large businesses thrive, jobs are created,
redevelopment continues, tourism grows and businesses locate in the community.
Economic Development Division takes very seriously. Whatever the needs may be,
the Unified Government's Economic Development Division is committed to working for:
• Increased job opportunities for local residents
• Increasing the tax base of the community in order to continue to provide high
quality services to businesses and citizens
• Creating a quality of life characterized by stable neighborhoods and diverse
opportunities
• Diversifying the local economy with growth in new technology, service sector,
and tourism industries
Community Improvement District (CID) - Under Kansas Statute KSA 12-6a29 cities
may create districts that help to fund community improvement. The Unified Government
has done so through Community Improvement Districts (CID). A CID is an area within
which businesses pay an additional sales tax (typically 1% or less) or a special
assessment that fund improvements within that district.
Economic Development Exemption (EDX) - Article 11. Sect. 13 of the Kansas
Constitution allows the counties of Kansas to grant exemptions of ad valorem taxes
(property taxes) for business with a lifetime of up to 10 years. There are certain
qualifications these businesses must meet. The property (real or personal) must be
used exclusively for manufacturing articles of commerce, conducting research or
development, or storing goods which are sold or traded in interstate commerce.
Investment Revenue Bonds (IRB) - Investment Revenue Bonds (IRBs) are used in
Kansas to finance acquisition and construction of a broad variety of industrial,
commercial and industrial properties under K.S.A. 12-1740 et seq on behalf of private
businesses or non-profit agencies. IRB’s require a governmental entity (the Unified
Government) to act as the "Issuer" of the bonds, who will hold an ownership interest in
the property for as long as the IRBs are outstanding. The businesses gain several
benefits with the use of IRB's including the possibility of tax exemption.
Neighborhood Revitalization Program - Tax Rebate Program - The Unified
Government Board of Commission is offering tax rebates to homeowners, nonoccupying developers, retail, commercial, and industrial businesses who make
significant improvements to their property.

345

The Neighborhood Revitalization Tax Rebate Program provides owners within the
designated area the opportunity to receive a rebate of any additional property taxes
assessed as a result of the significant property improvements.
The Tax Rebate Program is a refund of the additional taxes paid because of a qualified
improvement. The rebate applies only to the additional taxes resulting from the increase
in the assessed value of the property due to the qualified improvement. The property
taxes prior to the improvement will continue to be payable. Taxes must be paid when
they are due, a rebate check will be issued.

Revolving Loan Fund - The Unified Government recognizes the needs of the small
business community. To address this challenge, we are pleased to offer the Revolving
Loan Fund (RLF).
Loan Types 1. Real Estate Loan – Up to 15 year term
2. Machinery & Equipment Loan – Up to 10 year term
3. Working Capital – Up to 3 years
4. Maximum Loan of $200,000
Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (STAR Bonds - Sales Tax Revenue (STAR) Bonds the
Unified Government the opportunity to issue bonds to finance the development of major
commercial, entertainment and tourism areas and use the sales tax revenue generated
by the development to pay off the bonds. The most popular example of the issuance of
STAR Bonds by the Unified Government is the Village West development in Western
Wyandotte County.
Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Section 42- - The Tax Credit Program does not
provide loans or grants but rather a tax incentive to owners of affordable rental housing.
The incentive is an annual tax credit (a dollar for dollar reduction in the tax payer’s
federal taxes) earned in the initial ten years following when the units are placed in
service assuming program requirements are met. A developer markets or “syndicates”
the credits allocated to the development to investors whose contributions are used as
equity in the development’s financing plan.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) - A Tax Increment Financing (TIF) District allows the
Unified Government to use its power of eminent domain (i.e. condemnation) to acquire
property needed for a development project and to use the funds generated by the tax
increment (new property taxes generated by the project) in the project.
TIF Districts may exist for up to twenty (20) years per project. In accordance with
Kansas Laws, these funds may only be used for TIF-eligible expenses, which include
but are not limited to:

346

•
•
•

Land Acquisition & Relocation (of families)
Public Improvements (curb, sidewalks & streets)
Site Preparation (demolition)

Section 2.

Scope. This Policy shall apply to the City of Kansas City, Kansas (“City”).

Section 3. Policy Statement. To meet the economic goals of the community, it shall
be the policy of the Unified Government to typically provide a 45% real property tax
abatement for portions of a Project that qualify for tax abatement under Kansas law so
long as the Project meets the criteria established by the Unified Government. Depending
how the tax abatement is structured over the term, tax abatement for a Project may
exceed an overall average of 45%. It shall be the policy of the Unified Government that,
regardless of the percentage amount of bonus provisions an applicant may be eligible
for, the maximum percentage of abatement provided for any Project shall not exceed
75% for 10 years.
It shall also be the policy of the Unified Government that economic development
Projects pay their fair share of property tax, special improvement district assessments,
and cost of utility services. Economic development Projects shall have a positive
financial impact on the community, and the Unified Government reserves the right to
approve the cost-benefit analysis model used to determine the financial impact. The
Board of Commissioners shall consider the following factors when granting property tax
incentives pursuant to Section 13 of Article 11 of the Kansas Constitution and K.S.A. 121740 et seq. and 79-201a.
A.

Existence of Economic Benefit. The Project must add to the local
economy. Evaluation criteria to be used in determining benefit to the

348

community shall include but shall not be limited to the following: the
amount of Capital Investment; whether the Project produces value- added
products and services; number of jobs created and associated payroll;
and whether the Project provides a positive fiscal impact and
economic impact.
B.

Type of Business. The Project shall be of a nature that is desirable and
stimulates
the local economy and improves the quality of life for its
citizens. Additional considerations may include whether the Project has
the effect of supporting or spurring other development and whether a
Project would help achieve successful completion
of
an
existing
commercial or industrial park or the development of a new commercial
or Industrial enterprise.

C.

Compatibility with Adopted Plans. All Projects shall be consistent with
the Unified Government Comprehensive Plan, any applicable corridor
plans, and other plans of the Unified Government which may be relevant
to the Project. When evaluating proposed Projects, the Unified
Government will consider a variety of factors to determine compliance,
including compatibility of the location of the business with land use and
development plans of the Unified Government and the availability of
existing infrastructure facilities and essential public services.

D.

Excluded Businesses. In addition to the uses of property prohibited by
K.S.A. 79-201 (a) Second, the following uses shall not be eligible for
property tax abatement: car wash, day care, private school, veterinary
clinic, storage facility, and branch bank offices. The Unified Government
may, at its sole discretion, waive any of these prohibitions if the applicant
demonstrates compelling and unique circumstances regarding its Project.

E.

Maintain Existing Tax Base. To facilitate new development, the Unified
Government shall assist new industries that invest in new buildings and
building expansion. However, the amount of property taxes or
special assessments on the existing land and facilities shall under no
circumstances be reduced for new development Projects.

F.

Transfer of Ownership. The owner or lessee of any property that is all or
partially exempt from ad valorem taxes as the result of the Unified
Government having granted the exemption shall obtain the Unified
Government written consent before transferring majority ownership of the

349

property unless the transfer is to an affiliate or a related entity.
Section 4. Definitions. For purposes of this Tax Abatement Policy, when used in this
Policy, the following words shall have the following meanings. Additional definitions may
be added in exhibits to this Policy.
ABATEMENT: The difference between the amount of ad valorem property taxes an
entity would pay if there were no abatement granted and the amount required to be
paid as payments in lieu of taxes. For example, if the taxes required with no abatement
were $5,000, and the required in lieu payments were $3,000, the “abatement” would be
$2,000.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, or entity making application to receive private activity
conduit financing and/or requesting tax abatement.
BOND COUNSEL: That firm or individual designated by the Unified Government to
handle legal and financial matters and issues associated with the issuance of
temporary notes and bonds by the Unified Government.
CAPITAL INVESTMENT: Capital investment shall include expenditures for land,
buildings, or personal property subject to ad valorem taxation.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EXEMPTION or EDX: For purposes of an abatement
pursuant to the Kansas Constitution, this term shall mean the establishment of a new
business or the expansion of an Existing Business, engaged in manufacturing
commodities which are sold or traded in interstate commerce.
EXISTING BUSINESS: A business shall be an “Existing Business” if it has had

Section 5. Abatement Criteria and Adjustments.
Adjustments made to increase
the total amount of abatement are intended to be provided as an extra incentive to
exceed certain criteria when others may not be met and to fulfill certain goals of the
community. The following are the criteria for abatement and adjustments to the total
amount of abatement.
A.
Project Investment Bonus.
It is the goal to strengthen the local
economy through the growth of the local tax base. Capital Investments
produce a long-term tax benefit to the community; therefore a major Project
may be eligible for an additional abatement percentage determined by the level
of capital investment. To be eligible for the Project Investment Bonus, the
Project’s construction labor costs must comply with the provisions of the DavisBacon Act, 40 USC 276(a). Depending upon the Project’s capital investment,
an increase in the abatement may be considered as follows:
a. Capital Investment of up to $24,999,999 may receive a bonus of up to

5%
b. Capital Investment of $25,000,000 to $49,999,999 may receive a
bonus of up to 10%

351

c. Capital Investment of $50,000,000 and above may receive a bonus of

up to 15%
B.

Target Area Bonus. It is a goal to encourage development/
redevelopment in distressed areas of the community.
Strong
consideration will be given for a business that will be located in a targeted
area for economic development or redevelopment. An abatement
adjustment of up to 10% may be considered for Projects that locate in the
targeted area. The Target Area is defined in Exhibit A of this document.

C.

Targeted Industries. It is a goal to attract and retain certain targeted
industries for the community due to their long term economic impact. An
abatement adjustment of 5% to 15% may be considered for Projects that
are in targeted industries. The current targeted industries generally
include Class A office, high technology and bioscience-related
businesses and development. The attached list of Targeted Industries
and associated abatement bonuses are defined in Exhibit B of this
document.

D.

Residency Bonus: It is a goal to create new employment opportunities
for community Residents. An abatement adjustment from 5% to 10% will
be considered depending on the percentage of Wyandotte County
Residents employed by the company receiving tax abatements; the
required percentage of Wyandotte County Residents and the associated
abatement percentage are attached in Exhibit C of this document. To be
considered for this abatement bonus a minimum of 35 total jobs must be
created in the first year of operation. Existing Businesses which apply for
abatement will be examined for the

amount of existing Wyandotte County Residents currently employed in operations, as
well as commitment for new hires due to the Project receiving abatement. To maintain
this abatement bonus, the company will be required to provide an annual certification of
the number of Wyandotte County Residents employed.
E.

Minority, Women, and Locally Owned Businesses Bonus: It is a goal
to give opportunities for the utilization of Minority, Women, and Locally
Owned Business where available and applicable. A bonus of 5% to 10%
may be given depending on the participation of MBE, WBE, and LBE in
the construction of the Project receiving tax abatement; the attached list
of MBE, WBE, LBE percentages and associated abatement bonuses are
defined in Exhibit D of this document. It is the intent that the designated
percentages for each of MBE, WBE, LBE categories are achieved, but an
adjustment may be made for a designated level of cumulative

352

participation by MBEs, WBEs, and LBEs.
F.

Environmental Design Bonus. It is a goal to create quality and
sustainable developments / structures throughout the City. The City, at its
sole discretion, may require higher design standards for the design of
buildings and materials used for Projects receiving property tax
abatement. An abatement adjustment will be given to businesses whose
new construction achieves U.S. Green Building Council LEED
Certification. This abatement adjustment shall range from 5% to 10%
given the level of LEED Certification. The levels of certification and
associated bonuses are defined in Exhibit E of this document.

Section 6.

this Policy will be determined by the amount of new Capital Investment in the City.

to this Policy shall be accompanied by a performance agreement between
the applicant and/or lessee and the Unified Government. Any tax
exemption or abatement is subject to annual review and determination by
the Unified Government County Administrator that the conditions qualifying
the business for the exemption or abatement continue to exist. The
Unified Government at any time may review information provided by the
company, lessee, or State of Kansas, or may request additional
information to determine compliance with the performance agreement. If
the Board of Commissioners finds that the business or Project is not in
compliance, then the tax exemption or abatement may be modified
pursuant to the performance agreement or eliminated as the Board of

354

Commissioners deems appropriate. The County Assessor and the Board
of Tax Appeals shall be notified of such action. Each performance
agreement shall contain a notice and waiver disclosing to each applicant
that the Unified Government reserves the right to grant future tax
exemptions or abatements on comparable Projects in amounts different

and waiver shall include a provision that the applicant waives any right to
request a modification or amendment of such exemption or abatement
based upon such differences.
B.

Clawbacks. Each performance agreement for a Project shall provide
that the percentage of property tax abatement shall be scaled back to the
term provided for in this Policy if, within three years after the issuance of
the Private Activity Bonds, the applicant has not incurred the required
Capital Investment.

C.

Utilization of UG Services. The performance agreement shall require
that the company receiving the property tax abatement (or any other
user of the property) utilize solid waste services provided by the Unified
Government. This requirement shall not apply to any user if the user
demonstrates that solid waste services provided by the Unified
Government are not adequate to serve such user’s reasonable needs.

D.

Fee Schedule. The Fee Schedule for applications, issuance, and
monitoring is contained in Exhibit F of this document. Such Fee Schedule
shall apply to both Private Activity Bonds and EDX abatement requests.
The Fee Schedule will be made available upon request.

Section 9. Authority of UG Commission. The Board of Commissioners reserves
the right to deviate from this Policy, but not any procedure set forth in this Policy or
any other procedural requirements of State law, when it considers such action to be of
exceptional benefit to the Unified Government or extraordinary circumstances prevail
that the Commission believes such deviation is in the best interests of the Unified
Government.

employees) are administered 54 through a third party administrator for the Unified
Government’s self-insured plan. Premiums are paid by employer and employee
contributions into an internal service fund and are available to pay claims and costs of
an administrative service agreement. An excess insurance policy covers individual
claims in excess of $190,000. Incurred but not reported claims of $1,835,000 have been
accrued as a liability. In 2011, $24,099,715 was paid for claims and administrative
costs. The outstanding claims liability is calculated from historical data and future
expectations. This includes an estimated liability for known claims as well as an
estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported. The BPU is self-insured on
essentially up to 100% of their health claims.
Workers’ Compensation. The Unified Government is self-insured for workers'
compensation. Premiums are paid from the general fund into an internal service fund
and available to pay claims, claim reserves and administrative costs of the program.
During 2011, a total of $1,753,571 was paid in benefits and administrative costs from
the fund. An excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of
$750,000. Incurred but not reported claims of $3,450,000 have been accrued as a

liability is calculated from historical data and future expectations. This includes an
estimated liability for known claims as well as an estimated liability for claims incurred
but not reported. The BPU is self-insured to the first $350,000 per employee / per
occurrence for workers' compensation. Claims exceeding $350,000 and up to
$35,000,000 per employee / per occurrence are fully insured.
General Liability. The Unified Government is also self-insured for liability claims with
no premium paid to any insuring firm. All liability claims are reviewed, challenged if

If outside investment professionals are retained, they shall be held to the “prudent
expert standard,” that is, they shall exercise the judgment, care, skill, prudence and
diligence, under the circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence,
discretion and intelligence acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would
use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims by diversifying
the investments so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless, under the
circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so, and not in regard to speculation but in
regard to the permanent disposition of similar funds, considering the probable income
as well as the probable safety of their capital.
The Chief Financial Officer, other investment officials, and the members of the CMC,
when acting in accordance with the written Investment Procedures and the Cash
371

Management and Investment Policy, and when exercising due diligence, shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price
changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
B.

Ethics and Conflict of Interest
Unified Government officers and employees authorized to perform investment duties
shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution and
management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make
impartial decisions. For purposes of this Policy, “officers and employees” means voting
members of the Cash Management Committee and the Cash Manager; it shall not
mean elected officials.
No officer or employee shall use his or her official position or office to obtain direct or
indirect personal financial gain for himself or herself, his or her family, or any business
in which the officer or employee has a financial interest. Officers and employees are
governed by this Policy, the Unified Government Code of Ethics, and any applicable
state laws.
Investment staff shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the
same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the Unified Government.
Officers and employees shall disclose annually to the Legislative Auditor and to the
Ethics Administrator any financial interest in financial institutions with which the Unified
Government conducts business or any benefit which the officer or employee obtains
from any Unified Government contract or from placement of an investment of Unified
Government funds. For purposes of this Policy, “financial institution” means banks,
savings banks, or savings and loan associations as defined in K.S.A. 12-1675a and
amendments thereto. For purposes of this Policy, “financial interest” means (a)
ownership or any interest or involvement in any relationship from which, or as a result of
which, a person within the past year has received, or is presently or in the future entitled
to receive, more than $5,000 per year, or its equivalent; (b) ownership of such interest in
any property or any business as may be specified by the Ethics Commission; or (c)
holding a position in a business such as an officer, director, trustee, partner, employee,
or the like or holding any position of management. Financial interest does not include
household operating accounts or a depository relationship with a financial institution.
Each financial institution in which the Unified Government deposits funds and each
investment manager and each consultant retained by the Unified Government shall be
notified of this section of the Policy and shall conform to its provisions and shall not
participate in any violation of this section or in any effort to influence any officer or
employee to breach the standards of ethical conduct set forth in this section.

372

Section 10. Objectives
The primary objectives of the Unified Government investment activities, in priority order, shall
be:
A.

Safety.
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program.
Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of
principal in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit and interest rate
risk.
1. Credit Risk
Credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, will be
minimized by:
a.
b.
c.

Limiting investment to the safest types of securities;
Pre-qualifying financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries, and
advisors with whom the UG will do business; and
Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential loss on individual
securities will be minimized.

2. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk, the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall
due to changes in general interest rates, will be minimized by:
a.

b.
B.

Structuring the investment portfolio so that the securities mature to meet
cash requirements of the general operating fund, thereby avoiding the
need to sell securities prior to maturity; and
Investing general operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities.

Diversification.
1.

In General
It is the policy of the Unified Government to diversify its investment portfolio so as
to protect its funds from material losses due to issuer defaults, market price
changes, technical complications leading to temporary lack of liquidity, or other
risks resulting from an over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a
specific issuer, or a specific class of securities.

2.

By Institution
Investments will be diversified so that reliance on any one issuer or financial
institution will not place an undue financial burden on the Unified Government in
the event of default. Accordingly, no more than 60% of the total investment
portfolio in a given 12- month maturity period shall be with the same institution,
373

unless it would be prudent to do so under prevailing circumstances. If the above
limit is exceeded, the Chief Financial Officer will notify the CMC.
3.

By Instrument Type
Market risk will be minimized by diversification among investment types. The
following are maximum limits for the percentage of Unified Government
investable funds to be invested in each investment type.
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.
h.

Certificates of deposit
U. S. Treasury bills or notes
U. S. Government agency obligations
Kansas Municipal Investment Pool
Money market funds
Repurchase agreements
Bank trust department municipal pools
Temporary notes or no-fund warrants

100%
100%
50%
50%
10/100%*
25/100%*
25%
10%

Because of distortion created by deposit of proceeds from the sale of temporary notes
issued by the Unified Government, measurement of the maximum limits on investments
by institution and by instrument type for purposes of this subsection 10.B. shall occur at
least one week after the deposit of such proceeds.
* NOTE:Investments in money market funds shall be limited to 10% of investable funds
and investments in repurchase agreements shall be limited to 25% of investable
funds except as set out below. While it is not the goal to invest 100% of
investable funds in either money market funds or repurchase agreements, the
ability to invest the maximum limit in these two investment types is recognized as
an option in certain market circumstances when these investments offer higher
returns than other investment types at minimal risk. The option to invest more
than the 10% or 25% limit respectively will be used only when the Cash Manager
determines, with the concurrence of the Chief Financial Officer and the Unified
Government’s Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous and prudent to do so.
C.

Liquidity.
1.

The Unified Government’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to
enable it to meet all operating requirements that might be reasonably anticipated
without incurring material losses by structuring the portfolio so that securities
mature concurrent with anticipated cash needs. Since all possible cash
demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities
with active secondary or resale markets.

2.

The Unified Government understands the importance of having sufficient funds
invested in overnight sweep accounts to meet weekly payrolls, accounts payable,
scheduled debt service, and extraordinary expenses that may occur, which may
range from 3% to 10% of available investment funds.
374

3.

D.

It is important for a county government to have the necessary funds for the
scheduled tax distributions to other governmental entities. In particular, liquidity
is essential for the January and June tax distributions. Therefore it is critical to
time the maturity of investments to meet this requirement.

Maturity.
1.

2.

All investments shall be made to mature in accordance with cash needs identified
in regularly prepared and updated cash flow forecasts. The Unified Government
recognizes that the laddering of investments is a sound approach to mitigate
short-term interest rate fluctuations. Additional considerations in the structuring
of investments shall include:
a.

Review of economic and financial indicators, such as Federal Reserve
monetary policy position statements and the U.S. Treasury yield curve;
and

b.

Input from the Unified Government’s financial advisor.

The Unified Government has adopted the following maturity target ranges for its
core investment portfolio. Core investments exclude the investment of bond
proceeds and the health care reserve funds.
a.
b.
c.
d.

0 – 12 months
12 – 24 months
24 – 36 months
36 – 48 months

30% to 60%
20% to 40%
15% to 30%
10% to 20%

Notwithstanding the above maturity target ranges, cash flow requirements and
existing interest rate markets may dictate the need to adjust the timing of
investment maturities.
3.

Extending the maturities in the investment portfolio is subject foremost to the
cash flow requirements of the Unified Government. To extend the maturity of an
investment for an additional12-month period a minimum gain in investment
earnings of 10 basis points is required.

4.

The sale of securities before maturity shall require the prior approval of the Chief
Financial Officer based on the following reasons:
a.
A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of
principal.
b.
Liquidity needs require a security to be sold.
c.
It is advantageous to the portfolio to sell such securities.
d.
Financial failure of the issuer is likely.
375

5.

E.

As long as this Policy continues to be approved by the State Pooled Money
Investment Board, the maximum maturity for investments shall be four years.
Otherwise the maximum maturity for investments shall be two years.

Return on Investment. The investment portfolio shall be designed to attain a
market-average rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into
account the UG’s investment risk constraints, state statutes, cash flow characteristics of
the portfolio, and prudent investment principles. As a benchmark for risk-free
investment transactions, the three-month constant maturity U.S. Treasury bill rate will
be the minimum standard for the portfolio’s rate of return. Return on investment is of
secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above.

Section 11. Performance Evaluation and Reporting
Investment performance shall be continually monitored and evaluated by the CMC.
Investment performance statistics and activity reports will be generated by the Cash
Manager. Summary investment reports will be provided quarterly to the Economic
Development and Finance Standing Committee of the Unified Government Board of
Commissioners, with copies to the County Administrator and to the Unified Government
Commission, and to the Cash Management Committee.
Reports shall include but not be limited to information on interest received, interest
earned, investment yield, types of investments, distribution by type of investments, ,
maturity schedule by month, weighted average term to maturity, evaluation of portfolio
to selected benchmark, and any other information deemed necessary by the Chief
Financial Officer or requested by the County Administrator or the Board of
Commissioners.

Section 13. Authorized Investments
A.

Idle Funds
The investments authorized for the idle funds (those funds not immediately required for
the purposes for which the moneys were collected) under this Policy shall be in
conformance with K.S.A. 12-1675, K.S.A. 12-1677b, and amendments thereto, and any
other applicable statutes or ordinances or resolutions and amendments thereto. As
long as this Policy continues to be approved by the Kansas Pooled Money Investment
Board, the investments permitted by K.S.A. 12-1677b shall be authorized investments
under this Policy. For purposes of this Policy, “investment rate” means a rate which is
the equivalent yield for United States government securities having a maturity date as
published in the Wall Street Journal, nearest the maturity date for equivalent maturities.
The 0-90 day rate shall be computed on the average effective federal funds rate as
published by the Federal Reserve system for the previous week.
If for any reason this Policy is not approved by the Kansas Pooled Money Investment
Board, the investments permitted by K.S.A. 12-1675 shall be the only authorized
investments under this Policy until such time as this Policy obtains the approval of the
Kansas Pooled Money Investment Board.
As long as this policy continues to be approved by the Kansas Pooled Money
Investment Board, the following are authorized investments, pursuant to K.S.A. 12-1675
and 12-1677b. The maximum maturity for investments under this subsection shall be
four years.
1.

United States Treasury and Agency Securities. Direct obligations of, or
obligations that are insured as to principal and interest by, the United States of
America or any agency thereof and obligations and securities of United Statessponsored enterprises which under federal law may be accepted as security for
public funds, except that such investments shall not be in mortgage-backed
securities. Investments under this paragraph shall be limited to securities which
do not have any more interest rate risk than do direct United States government
obligations of similar maturities. For purposes of this subsection, “interest rate
risk” means market value changes due to changes in current interest rates.

thereto, and this Policy.

Local Emphasis
1. Subject to the other requirements of this Policy, funds available for investment under
this section will be offered first to eligible financial institutions with a main or branch
office located in Wyandotte County. If such financial institutions cannot or will not
make the investments available at interest rates equal to or greater than the
investment rate as defined in K.S.A. 12-1675a, and amendments thereto, or if such
financial institutions are limited from bidding on the investment by the diversification
requirements of this Policy, then the funds may be offered to other eligible financial
institutions or entities permitted under this Policy.
2. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this Policy, the Unified Government will
offer $95,000 to every financial institution with a main or branch office located in
Wyandotte County. If such financial institutions will make the investment at interest
rates equal to or greater than the investment rate as defined in K.S.A. 12-1675a, and
amendments thereto, the Unified Government will make such investment for a term
selected by the Unified Government.

C.

revenue bonds for which the Unified Government is merely a conduit issuer) and
temporary notes in conformance with K.S.A.10-131, and amendments thereto.
The following lists the investments, which the Unified Government will consider

the obligations of which at the time of investment are rated in the three
highest rating categories by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard and

9.

Investments in shares of units of a money market fund or trust, the
portfolio of which is comprised entirely of direct obligations of the U.S.

381

13.

D.

No moneys shall be invested in a derivative as that term is defined in
K.S.A. 10-131, and amendments thereto.

Arbitrage
The Internal Revenue Code provides that on a periodic basis the Unified
Government is required to compute rebate on each bond issue. Rebate is the
calculated dollar amount representing the difference between what the issuer
actually earned from the investment of certain funds related to the bond issue
and the amount the issuer would have earned had those same funds been
invested at an interest rate equal to the yield on the bond issue. Absent an
exception to rebate, the Unified Government is required to pay or “rebate” to the
United States the dollar amount representing these excess earnings.
For each bond issue, rebate must be calculated and paid at least once every five
years and within 60 days after the last bond of the issue is paid. Payment of
rebate is a condition to maintaining the tax-exempt status of each bond issue,
and failure by the Unified Government to comply with the rebate requirements
may cause the interest on an issue of bonds to become taxable, retroactive to
their date of issuance.
The Unified Government’s investment position is to pursue the maximum yield on
investments without jeopardizing the tax-exempt status of the bonds. To the
extent possible, the Unified Government will seek to comply with applicable
exceptions to rebate and when necessary rebate any excess earnings to the
United States. The potential rebate of excess earnings will not influence the
Unified Government’s investment policies.

Section 14. Collateral Requirements
A.

Full Collateralization Required. All Unified Government deposits shall be fully
collateralized at all times.

B.

Initial Placement. Moneys to be deposited in financial institutions shall not be

invested in financial institutions in the form of a repurchase agreement where the
Unified Government takes delivery of the underlying securities.

C.

including idle fund investments, as permitted by K.S.A. 9-1402, and amendments
thereto, shall be limited to:

which is equal to 125% of the Unified Government deposits. Not more
than 5% of the Unified Government’s total idle funds portfolio may be
collateralized by the following securities.
a.

Peak Period Agreements. Peak-period agreements permitted under K.S.A. 91403 are not permitted under this Policy.

E.

Collateral Substitution. Collateralized investments often require substitution of
collateral. Any financial institution requesting substitution must contact the Chief
Financial Officer and receive written approval of any collateral substitution.
Substitution of collateral shall be required whenever, in the opinion of the Unified
Government Chief Financial Officer, the collateral no longer satisfies or complies
with the security requirements established under this Policy. Immediate written
notice shall be given to the financial institution when the Chief Financial Officer
makes such determination.

384

RED FLAG POLICY AND IDENTITY THEFT
PREVENTION PROGRAM (Adopted 5/11/11)
I.

Introduction

The Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas (the "UG")
developed this Identity Theft Prevention Program to comply with the Federal Trade
Commission's Red Flag Rule, which implements Section 114 of the Fair and Accurate
Credit Transaction Act of 2003. See 16 C. F. R. § 681.1; 15 U.S.C. § 1681c(h). This program
is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening and
maintenance of the following UG accounts:
1.

Any account that the UG offers or maintains primarily for personal, family, or
household purposes and that involves multiple payments or transactions; and

2.

Any other account that the UG offers or maintains for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the UG’s safety and soundness
from identity theft.

For the purposes of this program, "identity theft" is defined as fraud committed or attempted
using the identifying information of another person without authority.
This program was developed with oversight and approval of the chief financial officer. After
considering the size and complexity of the UG’s operations and account systems and the
nature and scope of the UG’s activities, the Board of Commissioners determined that this
program is appropriate for the UG and approved it on May 5, 2011.

II.

Identification of red flags

A “red flag” is a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of
identity theft. To identify relevant red flags, the UG considered the types of accounts that it
offers and maintains, the methods that it provides to open accounts, the methods that it
provides to access accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft. The UG has
identified in the listed categories the following red flags:
Category A: Alerts, notifications, or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency or service provider

391

Red flags:
1.

A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer report.

2.

A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze in response
to a request for a consumer report.

3.

A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address discrepancy.

4.

A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is inconsistent with a
person’s history or usual pattern of activity, such as a recent and significant
increase in the volume of inquiries; an unusual number of recently
established credit relationships; a material change in the use of credit; or an
account that was closed for cause or identified for abuse of account
privileges by a financial institution or creditor.

Category B: Suspicious documents
Red flags:
1.

Documents provided for identification appear to have been altered or
forged.

2.

The photograph or physical description on the identification is not
consistent with the appearance of the person presenting the identification.

3.

Information on the identification is not consistent with other information
provided by the person presenting the identification.

4.

Other information on the identification is not consistent with readily
accessible information on file, such as a previous signature or recent check.

5.

An application appears to have been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.

Category C: Suspicious personal identifying information
Red Flags:

392

1.

Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent with other sources
of information (such as an address not matching an address on a consumer
report or a Social Security number [SSN] that was never issued).

2.

Personal identifying information provided by a person is inconsistent with
other information provided by the person (such as inconsistent SSNs or
birth dates).

3.

Personal identifying information (for example, address or phone number) is
the same as shown on other applications or documents known to be
fraudulent.

4.

Personal identifying information is of a type commonly associated with
fraudulent activity (such as a fictitious billing address or an invalid phone
number).

5.

The SSN provided is the same as another customer’s SSN.

6.

The address or phone number provided is the same as or similar to that
submitted by an unusually large number of other persons opening accounts
or by other customers.

7.

A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information on an
application or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.

8.

Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with information
that is on file.

Category D: Unusual use of or suspicious activity related to an account
Red flags:
1.

A change of address for an account followed by a request to change the
account holder's name.

2.

An account is used in a way that is not consistent with prior use (such as
late or no payments when the account has been timely in the past).

3.

Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as undeliverable even
though transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
account.

393

4.

The UG receives notice that a customer is not receiving paper account
statements.

5.

The UG receives notice that an account has unauthorized activity.

6.

The UG receives notice that there has been a breach in the UG’s computer
system.

7.

The UG receives notice that there has been unauthorized access to or use of
customer account information.

8.

The UG receives notice that there has been unauthorized access to the UG’s
plans to take steps with certain data it maintains that contains customer
information (i.e. destroying computer files).

Category E: Notice of possible identity theft
Red flags:
1.

The UG receives notice from a customer, an identity theft victim, law
enforcement, or any other person that it has opened or is maintaining a
fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.

2.

The UG receives notice from another company or utility that identity fraud
is suspected.

III. Detection of red flags
To detect red flags in connection with the opening of a new account, UG personnel will take
one or more of the following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
1.

Require identifying information such as name, date of birth, residential or
business address, principal place of business for an entity, SSN, driver's license, or
other identification;

2.

Verify the customer's identity, such as by copying and reviewing a driver's license
or other identification card;

3.

Verify identity via a consumer reporting agency;

394

4.

Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity; or

5.

Independently contact the customer.

To detect red flags for an existing account, UG personnel will take the following steps to
monitor account transactions:
1.

Verify the identification of customers if they request information (in person, via
telephone, via facsimile, or via email);

2.

Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses;

3.

Do not share identity and banking information with anyone, including the
customer, but require the customer to give the information and verify with the
information on the account; and

4.

Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment purposes.

IV. Preventing and mitigating identity theft
UG personnel who detect red flags will take one or more of the following steps, depending
on the degree of risk posed:
1.

Continue to monitor the account for evidence of identity theft;

2.

Contact the customer;

3.

Change passwords or other security devices that permit access to the account;

4.

Reopen the account with a new number;

5.

Do not open a new account;

6.

Close the existing account;

7.

Notify law enforcement;

8.

Determine that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances; or

9.

Notify the program administrator for determination of the appropriate steps to
take.

395

To prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to UG accounts, the UG
will take the following steps with respect to its internal operating procedures:

V.

1.

Provide a secure website or clear notice that a website is not secure;

2.

When destroying paper documents or computer files containing customer
information, completely and securely destroy the documents or files;

3.

Password protect office computers and set computer screens to lock after a set
period of time;

4.

Require only the last 4 digits of SSNs (if any);

5.

Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information;

6.

Review reports and documentation and delete unneeded identity information;

7.

Keep computer virus protection is up to date;

8.

Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are necessary for
program administrative purposes; and

9.

Secure information that is being stored for state or federal retention guidelines.

Duties regarding address discrepancies

When the UG receives notice from a nationwide consumer reporting agency that the
address given by a customer substantially differs from the address contained in the
consumer report, the UG may reasonably confirm that the address provided by the
customer is accurate by any of the following means:
1.

Verifying the address with the customer;

2.

Reviewing utility records;

3.

Verifying the address through third-party sources; or

4.

Other reasonable means.

If an accurate address is confirmed, the UG will furnish the address to the nationwide
consumer reporting agency from which it received the notice of address discrepancy if the

396

UG establishes a continuing relationship with the customer and regularly and in the
ordinary course of business furnishes information to the consumer reporting agency.

VI. Updating the program and red flags
This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to
customers or to the UG’s safety and soundness from identity theft. At least annually, the
chief financial officer will consider the UG's experiences with identity theft; changes in
identity theft methods; changes in identity theft detection, prevention, and mitigation
methods; changes in types of accounts that the UG maintains; and changes in the UG's
business arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, the chief financial
officer will determine whether changes to this program, including the listing of red flags, are
warranted. If the chief financial officer determines that administrative changes are
warranted, he or she will implement such changes. Specific policy changes will be
presented to the Board of Commissioners with the recommended changes and the Board of
Commissioners will determine whether to accept, modify, or reject them.

VII. Program administration
A. Oversight. The chief financial officer will act as program administrator and oversee
this program. The program administrator will be responsible for the program's
implementation and administration, including ensuring appropriate training of staff,
reviewing staff compliance reports , determining which preventive or mitigating measures
should be taken in particular circumstances, and approving changes to the program to
address changing identity theft risks.
B. Staff reports. UG staff responsible for developing, implementing, and
administering this program will report to the program administrator at least annually on
compliance by the UG with the Red Flag Rule, 16 C.F.R. § 681.1. The report will address
material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as the effectiveness of
policies and procedures in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the
opening of accounts and existing accounts; service provider arrangements; significant
incidents involving identity theft and management’s response; and recommendations for
changes to the program.
C. Service provider arrangements. When the UG engages a service provider to perform
an activity in connection with one or more accounts, it will take steps to ensure that the
service provider conducts its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures

397

designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. These steps may include
requiring the service provider by contract to have policies and procedures to detect red flags
that may arise in the performance of its activities, to report any red flags to the program
administrator, and to take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.
