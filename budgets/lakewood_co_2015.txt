City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) presented a Distinguished Budget
Presentation Award to City of Lakewood, Colorado for its annual budget for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014.
In order to receive this award, a governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets program criteria as a policy
document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan, and as a communications device.
This award is valid for a period of one year only. We believe our current budget continues to conform to program
requirements, and we are submitting it to GFOA to determine its eligibility for another award.

City Maanager’ss Budgeet Messaage

October 133, 2014 
 
 
e Mayor and Members of Cityy Council: 
Honorable
 
The  City’s   financial  posiition  is  as  stro
ong  as  it  has   ever 
e
been.    Yeet,  economic   volatility  and   uncertainty  p
persist.   
Because of this insecuritty, we must remain cautiouss and prudent  in the projectss we plan and  the level of seervices 
we  provide  to  the  public.    Sales  tax   revenue 
r
is  the
e  City’s  primarry  source  of  in
ncome.    Unlike  income  taxees  and 
property  taxes, 
t
discretio
onary  consum
mer  spending  drives  sales  taax  revenues  ffrom  year‐to‐yyear  and  mon
nth‐to‐
month.  Co
onsumer confidence and sales tax receiptss can fluctuatee in large amouunts, and in sh
hort periods off time.  
Because of this, the Cityy has been carreful to manag
ge its spendinng wisely, and  contain costs  whenever possible.  
Management  has  gained  valuable  exp
perience  doing
g  this  during   tthe  recent  reccession,  and  w
we  remain  poissed  to 
respond to
o economic fluctuations.  We
e remain thoug
ghtful in our plaanning, and sttrategic in our  decisions.   
 
Management  has  been   successful  in   containing  operating  costss  which  has  eenabled  the  C
City  to  make  ccritical 
investmen
nts in infrastruccture.  With co
ost containmen
nt and sensiblee planning, thee City added to its reserves d
 during 
2013, for the 9th consecu
utive year.  Due
e to this carefu
ul managemennt, the 2015 Buudget plans a d
 decrease in reserves 
in  order  fo
or  the  City  to
o  construct  sig
gnificant  infrastructure  proj ects  in  the  co
ommunity.    W
We  can  utilize   these 
reserves w
while maintainiing consistent  levels of service.  In additioon, managemeent will seek to
o partner with
h other 
governments and the private sector in  delivering services, and reduucing costs.  T
The City’s overaall financial strrength 
provides  flexibility 
f
until  the  consumer  economy  becomes  morre  stable.    Co
onsistent  and   sustained  fin
nancial 
strength iss critical to the success of the
e community.     
 
As mentio
oned, the City  is vulnerable t
 to economic fluctuations annd unpredictab
ble revenues.    The City’s revvenues 
are also lim
mited by the T
Taxpayer’s Bill  of Rights (TABOR) constituutional amendment.  In 20155, the City will make 
another re
evenue refund  of $1.3 million
n.  Forecasting the revenue l  imitations is an additional challenge in plaanning 

22

City Maanager’ss Budgeet Messaage
the  City’s   future.    As  we  plan  for  eco
onomic  growth
h,  and  experieence  the  resullts,  we  must   rremain  mindfu
ul  that 
revenues w
 will remain limited by TABOR
R.           
 
In  addition
n  to  City  government,  the   Lakewood  co
ommunity  is  eexperiencing  n
noticeable  eco
onomic  growtth  and 
reinvestme
ent  since  the
e  national  reccession.    Lake
ewood  is  advvancing  its  quuality  of  life   by  focusing   on  its 
neighborhoods,  schools  and  commun
nity  sustainability.    This  is  a  result  of  the  combined  eefforts  of  the   entire 
community,  including  ciitizens,  small   and  large  businesses,  the  nnon‐profit  com
mmunity,  the  eeducation  and  faith‐
based com
mmunities, eleccted officials, aand City worke
ers.   
 

Opera
ations and  Commun
nity Activitties 
 
In the last  year, the Cityy has made furrther progresss in its multi‐yeear effort to reevise its Comp
prehensive Plaan and 
create its f
 first Sustainab
bility Plan.  The process was designed to ggather public i input, create w
 working group
ps, and 
finalize a p
 plan in 2015.  L
Later this yearr we will conclu
ude the plan d
 development p
 phase and tran
nsition into an  open‐
house  form
mat  before  ne
ext  year’s  ado
option.    The  City 
C is  celebratting  the  addittion  of  two  neeighborhoods   to  its 
Sustainablle  Neighborho
oods  Program
m.    Lakewood’’s  Sustainablee  Neighborhoo
ods  Program   gives  residents  the 
opportunitty  to  becom
me  active  parrtners  in  maaking  Lakewoood  a  vibran
nt  and  sustainable  comm
munity.  
Neighborh
hoods  particip
pating  in  this   unique  certification  prograam  use  guidaance  from  City  staff  to  org
ganize 
workshopss, projects and
d events that enhance the livaability of their r neighborhood
d, and reduce  residents' ecollogical 
footprint.   Participating  neighborhood
ds earn prograam credits for  their efforts a
 and, depending on the num
mber of 
credits earrned in a given year, they maay receive City  designation ass a “Participating Sustainablle Neighborhood” or 
an “Outsta
anding Sustain
nable Neighbo
orhood.”  As a  leader in the  community’s c
 commitment t
 to sustainability, we 
have  partn
nered  with  Cle
ean  Energy  Co
ollective  for  th
he  City’s  first   pparticipation  in
n  solar  energyy  generation.     Clean 
Energy Co
ollective has bu
uilt a communiity solar garde
en in which thee City has purcchased forty peercent of the e
 energy 
capacity off a ground‐bassed solar arrayy.  It is estimate
ed that the Citty’s portion of  the solar garden will generate 274 
kilowatts o
of electricity pe
er year.  The p
power generate
ed by the arrayy will be purch
hased by Xcel E
 Energy, and creedited 
to  our  govvernment  facilities.    The  Su
ustainability  Division  is  dedi cated  to  enhaancing  the  livees  of  residents,  and 
workers th
hroughout the City.  Neighborhood, enviro
onmental, andd economic suustainability will continue to  be an 
operating  focus for the C
 City for the fore
eseeable futurre.   
 
Amongst   a  number  of   the  City’s  sub
bstantial  econ
nomic  developpment  initiativves,  two  outp
puts  are  particcularly 
noteworth
hy.    Terumo  BCT  will  expand
d  its  global  he
eadquarters  inn  Lakewood.    Terumo  BCT,   Lakewood’s   largest 
private secctor employer,, is a global leaader in blood c
 component annd cellular tech
hnologies.  The company em
mploys 
more  than
n  4,500  associates  in  37  cou
untries,  and  se
erves  customeers  in  120  couuntries.    Today,  more  than   1,900 

23

City Maanager’ss Budgeet Messaage
associates work at Terum
mo BCT’s Lake
ewood campuss.  The companny broke groun
nd earlier this y
 year on a $45 m
 million 
expansion  with the pote
ential to create
e 250 jobs in the next five yeears.  In additiion to Terumo
o BCT, the FirsstBank 
Corporatio
on announced  a $40 million  expansion of  its headquarteers in Lakewo
ood.  FirstBankk has more thaan $13 
billion in assets and overr 115 locationss in Arizona, Caalifornia, and C
 Colorado. To a
 accommodate additional staaff and 
infrastructture for its grow
wing business,, the companyy is in the proceess of expandin
ng its headquaarters campus  with a 
120,000‐sq
quare‐foot,  fo
our‐story  build
ding  addition   and  a  new  sttand‐alone,  fo
our‐level  parkking  structure.    The 
company w
 will relocate so
ome regional  staff to the larger campus,  and it will increase the num
mber of jobs on site, 
along with
h its overall gro
owth. 
 

General  Fund Reven
nues 
 
As mentioned above, Citty government remains heavvily reliant on  sales and use  taxes.  During
g 2013, sales an
nd use 
taxes mad
de up more tha
an 62% of gen
neral fund reve
enues.  Sales t
 taxes increased 5.8% during
g 2013 over thee prior 
year as con
nsumers felt m
more confidentt in their spend
ding.  In spite o
 of this, we rem
main aware of t
 the volatility of sales 
taxes  as  experienced  du
uring  the  recesssion.    The  Citty’s  sales  tax   rrevenues  decrreased  by  7.6%
%  during  2009
9.    The 
current forrecast is for 20
014 sales taxe
es to grow at a
 a rate of 4.5%
% which is reassonable compaared to what w
 we are 
experiencing this year to
o date.  In add
dition, state ecconomists aree predicting evven larger ratees of growth in
n sales 
taxes,  acro
oss  the  state,   for  2014  and  2015.    Based
d  on  this,  we  believe  that  o
our  estimates   are  reasonable  and 
conservative.   
 
In  view  off  the  recent  an
nd  historic  revvenue  volatility,  the  City  haas  continued   tto  focus  on  itss  economic  baase  by 
promoting
g primary jobs,, and retail shopping in the  community.    In 2014, the A
Alberta Corporration completted its 
constructio
on  of  a  new  10 
1 acre  retail   center 
c
at  the   Denver  West   Promenade.     Some  new  bu
usinesses  opened  in 
Novemberr  2012,  while   additional 
a
new
w  retail  opened  in  2013  andd  2014.    This   is  a  meaningfu
ul  revitalizatio
on  of  a 
prominentt  site  in  the   Lakewood  co
ommunity.    The 
T
site  had   been  an  unuused  former  ccar  dealership
p  with 
environme
ental  needs  th
hat  had  becom
me  an  eyesore
e  in  the  comm
munity.    The  C
City  will  contin
nue  to  enhancce  and 
diversify itts tax base as a
 a guard againstt future economic ups, and d
 downs.        
 
Together,  overall General Fund revenu
ues increased  in 2013, and h
 have increased
d in 2014 comp
pared to last y
 year at 
this time.    Because of th
he quick and vo
olatile changess to revenues,  predicting thee short‐term and long‐term  future 
is difficult.  While our forrecast for incre
easing sales taxx revenues is 33.5% for 2015, w
 we believe thaat this is prudent and 
conservative  compared   to  economic   forecasts.    While 
W
there  arre  myriad  sceenarios  for  possible  improving  or 
worsening trends, this bu
udget projectss the current trrend plus modeest growth in 22015.

plans to uttilize some reserves, contain

During 2013, th
he City 
underspen
nt its operating
g budget by 6.3%, allowing u
us to increase  reserves.  While underspend
ding our budget, we 
remain mindful that we  spent 3.5% more in 2013 than in 2012.  Foor 2014 and 20015, managem
ment will contin
nue to 
monitor sp
pending in an  effort to contaain cost increaases.  Because  we deliver services to the c
 community, ou
ur City 
workforce   is  critical  to   our  success.     In  order  to   deliver  consiistent  and  effficient  servicees,  a  well‐equipped, 
competitivvely compensa
ated workforce
e is necessary.   In spite of ou r careful effortts, certain costts have continued to 
increase.     At  the  mome
ent,  the  City  iss  purchasing  electricity 
e
for   iits  street  lightts  and  signal   llights  at  a  cosst  that 
remains vo
olatile.  As we  do this, the m
managers of the
e City’s street  lights and sign
nal lights continue to analyzze, and 
implementt new ways of  doing business.   
 
The cost of providing me
edical benefits for City worke
ers has increassed by 10% oveer the last yearr.  In response  to the 
market, we have implem
mented alternaatives at a man
nageable cost  for the City and its workerss.  To be clear,, costs 
continue t
  o increase, butt we are slowin
ng the rate of  growth by impplementing these initiatives.  Beginning in
n 2010, 
the City sw
witched medical providers ass a result of a c
 competitive Reequest For Pro

offered itss workforce a l

General  Fund Balan
nce 
 
d  of  2003,  the
e  General  Fund
d  Balance  as   a 
a percent  of  tootal  operating
g  expendituress  was  11.9%  o
or  $8.8 
At  the  end
million.    The 
T same  calcu
ulations  for  the  2013  year‐end  General  Fuund  Balance  w
were  36.8%  or   $36.6  million.    City 
Council’s B
 Budget Policy  requires a min
nimum Generaal Fund Balancce of 10% whiile the TABOR
R requirement  is 3%.  
This 2015 B
Budget exceed
ds both require
ements. 
 
In  2012,  we 
w planned  forr  a  project  thaat  necessitated
d  a  transfer  off  fund  balancee  reserves  durring  2012,  2013,  and 
2014.  For  2014, we have transferred t
 the final amou
unt to the Cappital Improvem
ment Fund, neccessary to com
mplete 
the  projecct.    This  fundin
ng  provides  fo
or  the  overhau
ul  and  reconst ruction  of  thee  Civic  Center’’s  plaza  space,,  drive 
aisle, and  parking garage.  This infrasttructure had deteriorated siggnificantly in r
 recent years, aand was in diree need 
of  rehabilitation.    The  fa
acility  is  signifficant  in  servin
ng  as  the  centter  of  the  com
mmunity’s  civic  activities.    P
Project 
funding prrovided for a fu
ull evaluation,  design, and co
onstruction, whhich was comp
pletely funded in our 2014 Bu
udget.  
We will takke on another  phase of the p
 project in 20155 by rehabilitatting the neighboring Public S
 Safety Center  which 
has  sufferred  similar  de
eterioration.    The  Public  Safety 
S
Center   rehabilitation
n  will  be  fund
ded  by  the  C
Capital 
Improvement Fund.  Lasstly, we will traansfer $2.0 milllion in Generaal Fund Balance in 2015 to su
upplement thee City’s 
sidewalk construction prrogram.     
 
This  budge
et  will  reduce   the  fund  balaance  reserves  by 
b $2.3  millionn in  2014  and   $2.5  million  in
n  2015.   The   eending 
fund balan
nce for 2015 will be greater t
 than forecasted during last y
 year’s budget,  and finish 20114 at a level off $34.3 
million or 332% of expend
ditures.  This b
 budget forecassts 2015 year e
 end fund balan
nce reserves to
o be $31.8 million or 
29% of exp
penditures which is higher th
han the curren
nt policy.  It is t
 the strength in
n General Fund
d Balance that  offers 
the flexibillity to continue
e providing serrvices without  dramatic flucttuations from  year to year, aand for the pro
ovision 
of meaning
gful one‐time  infrastructure  projects.  
 
The follow
wing chart refle
ects the Generral Fund Balan
nce from 2008  through 20199, and comparees the Fund baalance 
to  10%  off  expendituress  plus  operatin
ng  transfers  out. 
o
  The  econnomic  uncertaainties  that  the  City  faces  w
will  be 
mitigated  by the use of  General Fund  Balance.  In ad
ddition, by buiilding fund ballance, the com
mmunity has crreated 
the opporttunity to provide for meaningful infrastruccture improvem
ments, as desccribed above.    This budget an
nd the 
long‐term   forecast  are   conservative, 
c
  and  anticipate
e  further  reduuctions  in  Gen
neral  Fund  Balance.    As  disccussed 
above,  the
e  current  revenue  trend  mayy  not  provide   adequate  lon g‐term  incom
me,  and  therefo
ore  services,   ffor  the 
long term.  Maintaining a
 an adequate fu
und balance will remain a priiority.

  Given the currrent economic environment, the Capital  Improvementt Fund (CIF) haas added only  a few

which
are subjecct to constant change. Thee Strategic Fin
nancial Plan ddoes not illusttrate future buudgets, servicces, or
programs in any detail, but only by fund type. The
T Strategic Financial Plaan is designedd to help makke two
fundamen
ntal decisions: “Where do we want to go?”
g
and “How
w are we goinng to get theree?”
Economicc Developmeent Policies
Economicc sustainabilitty and develo
opment play a vital role in improving thhe quality of llife for the ciitizens
of Lakew
wood. Existting businesss retention and
a
expansionn, new busiiness attractioon, and salees tax

Revenue Policies
The City of Lakewood
d strives to ach
hieve and maaintain a balannced and diveerse revenue sstructure. Beecause
Lakewood
d is a well-established com
mmunity, ann
nual revenues are fairly staabilized and ccan be used yyear to
year as a sound revenu
ue base. Majo
or revenue sou
urces in the G
General Fundd are sales andd use tax, prooperty
tax, interg
governmental revenues, fraanchise charg
ges, fines and forfeitures, an
and user fees aand charges.
The amou
unt of a fee shall not exceeed the overalll cost of prooviding the faacility, infrasttructure, or seervice
for which
h the fee is imposed. Fees for activitties and servvices are deteermined by reeflecting a pricing
philosoph
hy based on establishing feees commensurate with thhe benefit receeived. In caalculating thatt cost,
direct and
d indirect costts may be included. That includes:
i
costts that are dirrectly related to the provisiion of
the servicce and support costs that are more gen
neral in natuure but providde support foor the provisiion of
service. The
T City reviiews all fees for
f licenses, permits,
p
finess, and other m
miscellaneouss charges as ppart of
the annuaal budgetary process.
p
One-time revenues arre typically used
u
to fund one-time exxpenditures, ccapital improovements, orr fund
balances. These revenu
ues cannot bee relied upon in future buddget years.
Unpredicttable revenuees are budgeteed conservativ
vely, and anyy amount colllected in exceess of the buddget is
generally applied to fun
nd balances.
Expenditture Policies
The Geneeral Fund is comprised
c
of twelve (12) departments consisting off Mayor and City Councill, City
Manager, City Attorneey, City Clerk

Debt Poliicies
The City of Lakewood
d recognizes that
t
the primaary purpose oof capital faciilities is to suupport provisiion of
services to
t residents. Using debt financing to
o meet the caapital needs of the City m
must be evalluated
according
g to two tests:: efficiency and
a equity. The
T test of effficiency equaates to the higghest rate of rreturn
for a given investment of resources.. The test of equity requirees a determinnation of who should pay ffor the
cost of caapital improveements. In meeting
m
the demand for addditional capiital facilities, the City strivves to
balance th
he load betweeen debt finan
ncing and “paay as you go”” methods. T
The City realiizes failure too meet
the deman
nds of growth
h may inhibitt its continued
d economic vviability, but aalso realizes tthat too muchh debt
may have detrimental effects.
e
Through the
t rigorous testing of the need
n
for addiitional debt finnanced facilitties and the m
means by whicch the
debt will be repaid, the City strikess an appropriate balance bbetween serviice demands and the amouunt of
he City uses lease purchaase financing for the provvision of new
w and replaccement equippment,
debt. Th
vehicles, and
a rolling sttock to ensuree the timely reeplacement off equipment aand vehicles aand to decreaase the
impact off the cost to th
he user deparrtment by sprreading the coosts over seveeral years. T
This method iis also
used to accquire real prroperty. The type of leasee that the Cityy uses is term
med a conditiional sales leaase or
capital leaase, in effect a purchase raather than a reental of propeerty. For purrposes of secuuring credit raatings
and monittoring annuall debt service as a percentaage of operatiing expendituures, lease purrchase financcing is
considered a long-term
m liability of the City, alth
hough subjectt to annual apppropriation, and thereforre will
be issued under the sam
me conditionss as long-term
m debt.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The following notes and assumptions were used to build the detail for the 2014 Revised Budget and the 2015
Budget for revenues and expenditures. These assumptions apply to all funds except in cases where specifically
noted. The overall driving factors were established through joint efforts with the City Council, the City
Manager's Office, the Finance Department, and the Employee Relations Department.
The following schedules are the Fund Summaries for each of the funds included within the City's budget. There
are two funds maintained by the City that are not part of the City's budget process and each creates its own
specific budget. Those funds not included are the Lakewood Public Building Authority and the Lakewood
Reinvestment Authority.
Fund Balance is the excess or deficiency of the assets of a fund over its liabilities at any point in time. This is
shown in the following schedules as Revenues minus Expenditures plus Other Financing Sources (Uses) plus
Beginning Fund Balance to derive the Ending Fund Balance. Each Fund Balance is also shown as a percent of
expenditures plus operating transfers out. Discussion pertaining to fund balance changes will be noted below
within each fund type.

 The City utilized the Colorado Legislative Council’s Economics Staff’s “Economic and Revenue Forecast”
dated March 18, 2014 as the primary source for forecasted Denver-Boulder-Greeley Consumer Price Index
(CPI). In conjunction with the Economics Staff’s report, other methodologies used were City Council rate
increase, historical trends, judgmental analysis, current year activities, and unique adjustments (i.e. new
retail outlets, new fees, data from a specific source, etc.). Additionally, the City considers reports published
by economists in the Colorado State Office of Planning and Budgeting. City Council evaluated all of the
above factors and established a City Council Rate of 2 percent (2%) to be used with various revenues for the
forecasted years when the need for conservatism is recommended.

 The General Fund and the Capital Improvement Fund sales and use tax revenues are projected for 2014
through 2019 using various methods including CPI, historical trend, judgmental analysis, and unique
adjustments based on current year activities and known retail developments. The City uses a very
conservative approach to forecasting that only includes new retail or new development once agreements have
been signed.
 Sales tax for 2014 is forecasted to be up 3.4 percent (3.4%) primarily based on current year activity through
June. A 3.5 percent (3.5%) growth rate was used to forecast 2015 revenues and the City Council Rate of 2
percent (2%) was used for 2016 through 2019.
 For 2014, the City's general use tax is forecasted to come in at the 2014 original budget based on current
year activity. General use tax is expected to be at the CPI growth rate for 2015 and 2016 and at City Council
rate of 2 percent (2%) increase for 2017 through 2019. Motor Vehicle Use Tax for 2014 and 2015 remains
flat from 2013 actuals based on year-to-date activity, while a 2 percent (2%) increase for 2016 through 2019
is forecasted. Building Use Tax are expected to increase 5.9 percent (5.9%) for 2014 based on current yearto-date activity and is forecasted to grow at ta CPI rate of 2.8 percent (2.8%) for 2015 and a City Council
rate of 2 percent (2%) for 2016 through 2019.
 Revenues are built from the lowest accounting level up to the fund summaries. This detail will be
incorporated into the financial data and reports upon approval from the City Council. This level of detail
provides the end user with a method of tracking revenues.
 Overall revenues for governmental funds are down 2.5 percent (2.5%) for 2015 mainly due to a reduction in
intergovernmental revenues and grants associated with transportation infrastructure, public safety, energy
conservation, and family services offset by increases in sales and uses tax revenues, licenses and permit fees,
and charges for services.

 Expenditures are built from the lowest accounting level up to the fund summaries. This detail will be
incorporated into the financial data and reports upon approval from the City Council. This level of detail
provides the end user a method of tracking expenditures. All expenditures are categorized as either
Personnel Services, Services & Supplies, or Capital Outlay.
 Personnel Services costs are based on actual current data. Each individual employee's actual data for salary,
retirement, and other benefits are used to calculate year-end results. Salary increases for 2014 were
averaged at 3 percent (3.0%) for the Governmental Funds. Salary increases are projected for 2015 at 3.5
percent (3.5%) and at 2.25 percent (2.25%) for years 2016 through 2018. Medical benefit costs were
increased by 15 percent (15%) for 2014 and 2015 and at 12.5 percent (12.5%) for years 2016 through 2019.
Dental benefit costs reflect no increases for 2014-2019.
 In addition to salary and benefit increases, the Police Department experienced some police agent attrition
that triggered a need for a police recruit class. It is anticipated that based on attrition factors that the City
will have some recruits in each upcoming class which will take place every six months. This will have a
stabilizing effect on police recruiting and staffing.
 Services & Supplies and Capital Outlay are to remain unchanged in aggregate from year to year except for
an approved budget exception or as part of the Capital Improvement and Preservation Plan (CIPP). Budget
exceptions are required to be submitted for any increases in expenditures or operating transfers from the
General Fund. All other Governmental Funds are reconciled for carry overs unspent from prior years,
changes to currently approved projects, and addition of new projects based on individual fund capacity to
fund these projects. All of the budget exceptions and fund reconciliations are reviewed by a budget team
made up of members of the City Manager's Office, Finance Department, and Employee Relations
Department to determine whether the additional request is consistent with organizational goals and if funding
is available. Additional information concerning capital projects can be found under the Capital
Improvement and Preservation Plan section of the budget document.

the City of Lakewood from specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to
expenditures for specified purposes. The City’s Special Revenue Funds account for the
following:
CONSERVATION TRUST FUND
This fund is established as required by Section 31-25-220, Colorado Revised Statutes, 1973 to
account for monies received from the State of Colorado for Conservation Trust Fund (lottery)
and restricted for the purposes of planning, acquisition, development, and maintenance of new
conservation sites or for capital improvements or maintenance for recreational purposes on
public sites.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND
The Economic Development Fund is established by Ordinance 85-54 to account for the City's
hotel accommodation taxes which were approved by the voters in 1987 and restricted for the
purpose of promoting economic development within the City.
GRANTS FUND
The Grants Fund is established to maintain a separate accounting for Federal, State, and other
qualified grants.
HERITAGE, CULTURE & THE ARTS FUND
This fund is established to provide a full complement of heritage, cultural, and art activities to
the general public on a continuing basis financed primarily through user charges,
intergovernmental revenues restricted to these activities, and other financial resources assigned
specifically for these purposes.
OPEN SPACE FUND
This fund was established in 1987 to account for intergovernmental funds received from
Jefferson County related to its Open Space Sales Tax Resolution approved by voters in 1980

development, construction, acquisition, and maintenance of park and recreation capital
improvements.

CAPITAL PROJECTS FUNDS

Capital Projects Funds are created to account for resources used for the acquisition and
construction of major capital facilities and other capital assets other than those financed
by Proprietary Funds and Trust Funds. These funds are established to maintain a separate
accounting of specific capital projects as directed by City Council. The City's Capital
Projects Funds account for the following:
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND
The purpose of the Capital Improvement Fund is to account for expenditures for the
acquisition, construction, and improvements of capital assets. Revenue for this fund is
primarily derived from one sixth of the City's sales and use taxes approved by voters and
other intergovernmental revenues restricted for these purposes.
EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT FUND
The Equipment Replacement Fund is established to accumulate resources to finance the
acquisition, construction, and improvements of vehicle, technology, and public,
education, and government access equipment.

PROPRIETARY FUNDS

ENTERPRISE FUNDS
Enterprise Funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a
manner similar to private business enterprises where the intent of the governing body is
that the costs of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be
financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or where the City Council has
decided that periodic determination of net income is appropriate for accountability
purposes. The City has four qualified Enterprise Funds including Golf, Sewer,
Stormwater, and Water.

INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS
Internal Service Funds are used to account for the financing of goods and services
provided by one department or agency to other departments or agencies of the
governmental unit, or to other governmental units, on a cost-reimbursement basis. The
City's Internal Service Funds account for the following services: Dental Self-Insurance

ENTERPRISE FUNDS

Enterprise Funds are used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a
manner similar to private business enterprises where the intent of the governing body is
that the costs of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be
financed or recovered primarily through user charges; or where the City Council has
decided that periodic determination of net income is appropriate for accountability
purposes. The City has the following Enterprise Funds:
GOLF COURSE FUND
The Golf Course Fund was established in 1990 to develop the Fox Hollow at Lakewood
Golf Course, which opened in August 1993. An additional golf course, Homestead Golf
Course, was completed in Summer 2002.
SEWER ENTERPRISE FUND
The Lakewood Board of Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund was established as required by
Chapter 13.04, Section 080 of the City of Lakewood Municipal Code, 1974 supplement,
to account for sewer services provided to Lakewood residents on a user charge basis.
STORMWATER ENTERPRISE FUND
The Stormwater Enterprise Fund was created by City Council adopting Ordinance O-9828 to account for user fees collected from property owners to maintain existing storm
water facilities, meet federal requirements for storm water quality, and to build new
drainage facilities. All activities necessary to provide such services are accounted for in
this fund.
WATER ENTERPRISE FUND
The Lakewood Board of Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund was established as required by
Chapter 13.04, Section 080 of the City of Lakewood Municipal Code, 1974 supplement,
to account for water services provided to Lakewood residents on a user charge basis.

INTERNAL SERVICE FUNDS

Internal Service Funds are used to account for the financing of goods and services
provided by one department or agency to other departments or agencies of the
governmental unit, or to other governmental units, on a cost-reimbursement basis. The
City's Internal Service Funds account for the following services:
MEDICAL & DENTAL SELF-INSURANCE FUND
This fund was established by Ordinance for employee medical and/or dental selfinsurance purposes which include the payment of claims, administrative expenses, legal
expenses, and payment for prevention efforts. On April 1, 2010, the self-insurance
program for medical claims was discontinued.
PROPERTY & CASUALTY SELF-INSURANCE FUND
This fund was established by Ordinance for the purpose of paying premiums, claims,
judgments, settlements, legal fees, and any other self-insurance related program expenses.
The City has chosen to use large self-insured retentions/deductibles for its property and
casualty insurance program through the municipal insurance pool.
RETIREE'S HEALTH PROGRAM FUND
The Retiree's Health Program Fund was established to account for all of the necessary
activities of two benefit plans -- the Benefit Trust Plan, a defined contribution retirement
plan that distributes a lump sum amount to eligible employees upon retirement, and the
Pre-Funded Health Care Plan which distributes a monthly payment to eligible employees
upon retirement to supplement insurance premiums.
WORKER'S COMPENSATION SELF-INSURANCE FUND
This fund was established by Ordinance for worker's compensation self-insurance
purposes, which include the payment of claims, administrative expenses, employee
compensation, and funding a loss control program.

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

STRATEGIC PLAN
This Strategic Plan is updated annually and submitted to City Council for review and approval along with the
annual budget. The City Council and the City's Management Team review, confirm, and set the overall direction,
plan, and policies for the City. A City Council planning session is done annually at the beginning of each calendar
year with the outcome of a Mission Statement, City Council's Commitment to Citizens, and the Core Community
Values that drives the City's activities, expectations, and results-benefits.

The Strategic Plan:
 The Plan is a multi-year financial plan that looks at four years of historical data, current year budget, and five
years of future projections. Based on emerging issues and trends, the Plan directs the resources to meet
specific and achievable goals. City Council has adopted a policy of maintaining not less than a specified
minimum fund balance, as a percent to expenditures plus operating transfers out. For most funds, this
minimum fund balance is not less than five percent (5%). The exceptions to the five percent (5%) minimum is
the General Fund, not less than ten percent (10%), Capital Improvement Fund, not less than three percent
(3%), and Grants Fund, not less than zero percent (0%).
 Priorities and key issues for the new budget period are articulated.
 The policy direction and priorities of the City Council are encompassed.
 The major changes in priorities or service levels from the current period and the factors leading to those
changes are summarized.
 City Council and the City's Management Team are enabled to make funding decisions for services and capital
requests in a more predictable manner.
 Major financial factors and trends affecting the budget are identified and summarized.
 Financial summary data on the future revenues and expenditures in the City is provided.
 A basis for development of future budgets is provided.
 A balanced budget is maintained in accordance with the City Charter and Colorado law for the current year
plus next year's budget.
 City Council is informed of shortfalls in projected revenues that are insufficient to cover projected
expenditures.
The City Council is able to use the document to make decisions based on a combination of options:
- Reduce or increase projected operating and/or capital expenses by a critical review of departmental based
budgets
- Identify services offered to the citizens and closely monitor program successes
- Increase revenue by increasing fees and/or initiate a tax increase requiring voters' approval
- Reduce or increase reserve dollars and/or the percent of reserves in relation to expenditures plus
operating transfers out
- Adjust the assumptions used in the forecast model

FIVE–YEAR ASSUMPTIONS (2015-2019)
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS
 City Council has directed staff to work toward a minimum fund balance of five percent (5%) as compared to
expenditures plus operating transfers out for most funds except the General Fund is to maintain a minimum
fund balance of not less than ten percent (10%). The General Fund projections for 2014 through 2019
indicate that given revenue estimates and current spending levels, the City will maintain a fund balance above
10 percent (10%) through 2019. This will be monitored closely as dollars appropriated are not completely
spent in any given year, resulting in a potentially higher fund balance than projected which carries over into
future years.
 The City takes a very conservative approach to revenue projections for the budget year and for all forecasted
years. Revenues from new retail developments are only added when the probability of completion is
extremely high; therefore, any new developments that might come along have not been included in these
projections.
 The General Fund balance includes a three percent (3%) TABOR Emergency Reserve.
 The City continues to receive significant Grant funding for streets, sidewalks, traffic safety, public safety,
parks, and community services. Some of the grants received are Justice Assistance Grant, Community
Development Block Grant, Federal TEA-21, Auto Theft Task Force, 911 Authority, Scientific and Cultural
Facilities District, Environmental Protection Agency, and Head Start. These grants allow the City to continue
and expand existing programs as well as add new program functions to promote sustainability.

 Capital Projects are projected five years into the future allowing the funding to be established for given
projects at given time intervals. This allows staff and the City Council to better plan for upcoming projects
needed, required, or requested by the community. Many of the capital projects receive grant funding for a
given project that requires the City provide matching funds. This allows the City to best leverage and utilize
available funding.
 No new programs have been added for 2014 through 2019.

146

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

FIVE–YEAR ASSUMPTIONS (2015-2019) (continued)
LONG-TERM PLANS (2015-2019)
 The following is a list of some of the significant plans for 2015-2019.
- Update the City's Comprehensive Plan and create its first sustainability plan.
- Coordinate projects and protect the City's interests arising out of the construction of the Regional
Transportation District's (RTD) West Corridor Light Rail line
- Coordinate Rooney Valley design and construction within Lakewood and between Lakewood and the
Town of Morrison
- Implement capital building and facility improvements that support sustainability
- Implement technology replacement to improve productivity, communication, transparency, and data
storage and retrieval
- Focus on long-term community sustainability by promoting positive change throughout City actions,
partnerships, and education
- Enhance transportation through improvements to streets, roadways, bike paths, sidewalks, traffic signals,
and pedestrian signals
- Evaluate the possibility of regionalizing various public safety initiatives

REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS
 Overall, the City of Lakewood has experienced an improving economy over the past year. Revenue
projections for 2014 and 2015 assume a reasonable increase to sales and use tax revenues. Conservative
forecasts were established using either the Denver-Boulder-Greeley Consumer Price Index (CPI) growth rate,
a general inflation rate, and unique adjustments based on known new factors. A general inflation rate is
derived from the review of historical trends and current evaluation of economic factors utilizing the Colorado
State Economic Forecast.
 The City's property tax mill levy will remain at the current rate of 4.711 mills. This rate cannot be increased
without a vote of the citizens. Property tax revenue is projected to increase slightly in 2014 and remain
unchanged in 2015 through 2016. The City experienced a reduction in assessed values for 2011 through 2012
with slight increases in 2013. Bi-annual reassessments of property are conducted during odd years and
payable during the following even years. A small increase is anticipated for years 2017 through 2019. Due to
the property valuation trends we are experiencing, this revenue stream will be closely monitored and adjusted
as the need arises.

 A large portion of the City's revenues are subject to TABOR revenue limitations. The Stevinson/Denver West
annexations are perpetually exempt from TABOR revenue limitations as approved by the voters. In November
2005, the voters approved an exemption of the one percent (1%) sales and use tax rate increase from TABOR.
Also, in November 2006, the voters approved an exemption from TABOR of Open Space revenues and grants
for streets, public safety, parks, recreation, and cultural opportunities. The 2015 through 2019 revenue
projections assume no TABOR refund.

147

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

FIVE–YEAR ASSUMPTIONS (2014-2018) (continued)
REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS (continued)

 In the Special Revenue Funds, it is anticipated for 2015 through 2019 that only new dollars are forecasted and
that all available 2014 spending will be made. The Enterprise Funds for 2015 through 2019 reflect modest
increases in revenue with a decrease in overall fund balance due to expenditures being slightly higher than
revenues. Internal Service Funds show a significant increase in revenues and expenditures in 2015 and
forward due to the anticipated implementation of employee medical becoming a self-insured program. Overall
fund balance is projected to remain steady in years 2016-2019. These funds are restricted and used for
specific purposes and not available for general use.

 Other revenues except Charges for Services, Investment Income, and All Other Revenues are based either on
the forecasted CPI growth rate or a general inflation rate. Fees built into Charges for Services within the
General Fund for Family Services and for General Recreation anticipate full capacity for all classes/programs.
Should the revenues not come in as anticipated, the expenditures will be reduced accordingly. Investment
Income is forecasted based on historical and anticipated yields for the two-year treasury bond. The City
considers the ten year average of the two year treasury bond constant maturity index. The expected yield is
then applied to the applicable reserves. All other revenues are based on known significant factors.

148

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

FIVE–YEAR ASSUMPTIONS (2014-2018) (continued)
EXPENDITURE ASSUMPTIONS
 The City's primary increase in expenditures is in the cost of personnel. A salary increase of 3.5 percent
(3.5%) is planned for 2015 and a 2.3 percent (2.3%) for 2016 through 2019. Medical benefits are expected to
increase by 12.5 percent (12.5%) per year and no increase is expected for Dental benefits.

 Within the General Fund all other line items remain unchanged from the prior year, unless a specific budget
exception has been granted for additional funding. Excluding personnel, the departments have a base that is
equal to the most recent approved budget. If additional funding is required, a budget exception request is
made. All of the budget exceptions are reviewed by a core budget review group consisting of members from
the City Manager's Office, Finance Department, and Employee Relations Department to determine if the
request is approved or denied.
 Special Revenue Funds, Capital Projects Funds, Enterprise Funds, and Internal Service Funds are not part of
the budget exception process. Each individual fund within these are assigned a fund manager and the fund
manager is responsible for identifying the projects to be funded all the while maintaining the required fund
balance for that fund.
 A General Fund transfer of $1,400,000 in 2014 is being made to the Capital Improvement Fund for
improvements to the Civic Center Plaza, garage, and drive aisle. A General Fund transfer in the amount of
$2,000,000 will be made in 2015 to supplement the annual sidewalk construction program.

 Capital costs are based on the current Capital Improvement and Preservation Plan but include many smaller
projects not specifically identified within the Capital Improvement and Preservation Plan.

General Comments
The responsibilities of the Mayor and City Council continue to grow. The interests and demand for services of
Lakewood residents have become more sophisticated, challenging, and time consuming since the City's inception
in 1969. This calls for more study of the issues and more involvement of the Council at all levels of policy
discussion -- local, state, and national.
Each year, the City Council undertakes a leadership role in resolving metropolitan issues such as growth,
transportation issues, and tax policy.
 City Council is responsible for taking legislative action on items through consideration of ordinances and
resolutions, and develops positions on policy issues through discussion at Study Sessions.
 Open discussions among Council members are held twice each month during a Study Session, and Regular
City Council Meetings are held the second and fourth Monday nights of each month while Study Sessions are
held on the first and third Monday nights.

Lakewood City Council Swearing In

 City Council meets annually, in a retreat format, to discuss/prioritize key initiatives/opportunities for the
upcoming year.

Mayor Murphy gave his 2014 State of the City
 speech at the annual community luncheon that
helps raise funds for nonprofit organizations in
Lakewood, and the Lakewood-West Colfax
Business Improvement District and Alameda
Corridor Business Improvement District hosted
the event.
Mayor Murphy delivers 2014 State of the City Report

 City Council is responsible for reviewing and approving the City's budget, on an annual basis, for the
upcoming year.
 Council members serve as liaisons and members of many City and regional committees and organizations
such as the City’s Budget and Audit Committee, Council Screening Committee, Council Legislative
Committee, the Colorado Municipal League, the Denver Regional Council of Governments, the Metro
Mayors Caucus, and more.

General Comments (continued)
 During 2014, the City Council passed a new law requiring the City to license commercial waste haulers and
proclaimed its support for a Zero Waste Initiative for its public meetings. City Council approved adding
electronic smoking devices to the City's restrictions on smoking in public places and extended the moratorium
of retail marijuana, deciding to put a question on the November 2014 ballot, asking Lakewood voters if they
want to ban retail marijuana stores in Lakewood.
 Efforts along the West Line are still ongoing as part of the West Line Corridor Collaborative (formerly West

expanded to include other City Departments to create a strategic approach in seeking alternative resources.

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

Core Values / Goals / Activities / Expectations / Results-Benefits (continued)
Result-Benefit: Lakewood residents, including seniors, empty nesters and students, have more affordable
housing options available to them, while the City’s land use and zoning objectives are met.

General Comments
The 2014 Revised Budget does not reflect adjustments over the 2013 Budget, though that does not mean
there has not been change within the City Attorney’s Office. The long-time Deputy City Attorney retired in
February 2014 and that position had not yet been filled as of August 1st. The office also experienced
turnover in the Municipal Prosecutor/Assistant City Attorney position, with no impact on the budget. The
2014 Revised Budget does reflect one reclassification: another of the Municipal Prosecutor positions is to be
converted to a Lead Municipal Prosecutor in order to give one of our attorneys some level of supervisory
experience and to provide the Chief Municipal Prosecutor with assistance in overseeing the day-to-day
operation of the office. The office’s outside legal line item is expected to be taxed in the next year as a
complex, high-profile lawsuit moves into the discovery phase, but by the same token several other police
litigation matters were resolved favorably in recent months, reducing the City’s overall litigation burden.

increased efficiency. As a result, there has been reorganization and redistribution of funds with streamlining
occurring across divisions to reflect the changing needs of the community. Positive change is driven by utilizing
financial and human resources efficiently. The Department worked to realign its mission and goals and staff are
bought in to the Department's direction. The Department continues to conduct a short-term and long-term strategic
planning session with follow up meetings to determine the most effective use of resources and assess capital
project priorities. Opportunities for alternative resources through grants, corporate sponsorships, volunteers, and

General Comments
Fox Hollow continues to be rated among the best public golf courses in Colorado, and Homestead was recently
rated among the best short courses on a national level. The economics of the golf industry, however, have fallen in
the last several years. There are no new golf courses expected to be constructed over the next four to five years in
the west metropolitan area; however, we are competing for revenue dollars at a higher level of competition than
ever before. Moving forward, it will be important for the golf courses to maintain their current customer base,
serve the increasing numbers of golfing baby boomers and attract new customers.

General Comments
Improvements in the regional parks have continued in 2014. Much of the activity since September 2013 as been
focused on recovering from flood damage estimated at over $300,000. Completed projects include debris
removal, trail and bridge replacement and construction, building repairs, pier and dock replacement, and general
clean-up. Regional Parks has secured funding to assist with these recovery efforts from Jefferson County Open
Space (JCOS) and FEMA. Additionally, Regional Parks has secured Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) funding
and hired a contractor to complete stabilization work on three (3) segments of the Bear Creek stream channel that
were most impacted by the flood. Regional Parks has also received funding from GOCO to complete significant
repairs to the concrete trail system in Bear Creek Lake Park (BCLP) before the end of the summer.

The Natural Resources Section has continued to take on additional wildlife, trail, and weed management
responsibilities. Wildlife management included continued implementation of the completed Natural Areas Plan
and coordination of Lakewood's role in the Denver Metro Area Coyote Study, as well as partnership with the city
of Denver to remove Russian Olive trees from the Bear Creek Greenbelt. This project has been partially funded by
a GOCO Youth Corps grant.

Trail projects, improvements and reclamation efforts have continued at William Frederick Hayden Park including
a significant reroute on the Box-o-Rox Trail involving a funding partnership with the International Mountain Bike
Association. These projects were made possible through coordination with partners including Volunteers for
Outdoors Colorado, REI, the Colorado Mountain Bike Association, and regional park's volunteer trail crew.
Park attendance declined in 2013 due to drought and flood issues, but visitation seems to be increasing again in
2014. The park volunteer program continues to expand and now includes over 120 ongoing volunteers, and the
environmental education programs and events continue to reach a large audience of children and adults in the
Lakewood and Denver Metro area. Overall, the Regional Parks section will continue to serve the community by
welcoming hundreds of thousands of visitors to the parks each year while effectively managing and protecting the
valuable natural resources.

General Comments
In 2014 the Division began updating the central irrigation system. The Department and Division are trying to
move forward with addressing tennis court conditions throughout the system. Tennis courts at Westborough Park,
Daniels Park, Lasley Park, Green Mountain Recreation Center, Morse Park, and Lakewood Park were either
patched and crack sealed or overlaid. Costs for maintaining court surfaces and level of use are making it
appropriate to evaluate the number and location of courts that can be appropriately maintained for use by the
community.
The agreement for placing dog waste bag dispensing stations was modified in 2014. It is now a smaller program.
It cost the Division $7,000 per year.
Median renovation work on Colfax Avenue between Kipling and Sheridan was completed. The Division will now
begin formulating plans for work needed on medians west of Kipling.

Department of Employee Relations. Attention will continue to be directed toward state and federal regulations
such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), Title I and
Title II. Title I prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities and Title II
focuses on citizen accommodations. Policies, communication, and training will continue to be developed around
these issues.
Other regulations that will significantly impact the City's Benefits & Compensation include the Patient Protection
& Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Health Care & Education Reconciliation Act, Family Medical Leave Act
(FMLA), Colorado Family Care Act, Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA), Colorado Civil
Unions Act, Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and Occupational Safety and Hazards Authority (OSHA).

The Personnel Division will continue to conduct training sessions to further manage development and succession
planning as well as work on new employee on-boarding and retention efforts. Outreach efforts to the community
will promote Lakewood City government to job seekers.
Financial resources are provided by CIGNA and Kaiser totaling $70,000 for employee wellness iniatives. The
City's Employee Wellness Coordinator ensures the effective utilization of this program. Ongoing analysis of the
"Return on Investment" (ROI) for the funding of the Employee Wellness program will continue.

General Comments
Employees within the Department recognize their co-workers for performance that increases the effectiveness and
the team spirit of the Department. Each month, employees submit recommendations and three winners are selected
by a drawing. All of the submissions are reviewed by an employee team with representation from each division to
select a quarterly winner.

The above picture is of the most recent quarterly winners. Great job!!
Recognition of outstanding performance was given to the above recipients for:
 Recognition for extending part-time hours for six months and filling the full-time Specialist position. The
extra hours worked were important in that they enabled the Revenue Department to go through the hiring
process and run much smoother while short-handed.
 Recognition for leading the Revenue Division through the Gentax testing process. A great job
coordinating everyone’s roles and schedules while acting as the main support to everyone with questions
and issues, putting in the extra time to fill in all of the gaps as needed and was the “go-to” person for the
team as well as the supervisor’s “right hand man” for the entire implementation process. Their hard work,
passion and dedication to the project and the team was greatly appreciated
 Recognition for all efforts through emails and meetings in keeping the audit team running due to a
supervisor’s absence and manager’s leave. They were always willing to help answer any questions, put in
extra effort to ensure things continued to run smoothly.

Budget Variances
 Personnel Services
 2013 Actual vs. 2014 Budget is up $66,561 due vacancies in 2013 and an increase in benefit costs in
2014.
 Services & Supplies
 2013 Actual vs. 2014 Budget is up $66,706 primarily due to unspent funds in postage and delivery
expense.

Goals / Activities / Expectations / Results-Benefits
 GOAL: Deliver accurate and timely communication of financial and other applicable information
Activity: The records of the official City boundary and all City-owned real property interests are documented
and mapped in a geographic format.
Expectation: Mapping the City boundary and City-owned real property interests provides a clear delineation
of responsibilities for various City Departments and delineates the limits of jurisdiction for the Police
Department.
Result-Benefit: Accurate mapping of City boundaries, rights of way, and easements provides clear
determination of property rights, needs, and authority. Mapping the City boundary and City-owned properties
is done on a time-available basis but is considered to be crucial to the long-term needs of the organization.

Activity: Efficient, effective, and secure management of the City's flow of mail is assured by maintaining a
schedule of services on a daily basis to all City facilities.
Expectation: Efficient mail delivery is the life blood of any organization. The mail circulates revenues,
disbursements, and information on a daily basis. A daily pick-up and delivery of mail to all City facilities
will be provided on a regimented and reliable schedule, and an efficient and cost-effective bulk mail service
will be provided for regular direct communication with the constituents of various City services.

The above numbers do not include approximately 700 pieces of incoming and interoffice mail which are

New Postal Service regulations have necessitated changes in our process to provide nearly 100% Automation
(barcoding) of our outgoing mail.
Charge backs of postage and labor to outside entities, such as home owner associations and Metro West
Housing Solutions, have saved the City money, while causing a reduction in the number of automation (bulkmail) and total mail pieces.
 GOAL: Manage an orderly flow of the City's financial resources and assets to ensure financial
integrity
Activity: To meet the needs of the organization and its citizens, high-quality products and services at
reasonable costs are procured and assets are disposed of through an open and competitive process.
Expectation: Compliance with the Purchasing Ordinance is assured through competitive solicitations to
obtain the best value per dollar paid on the various assets, equipment, services, and contracts needed for the
City to provide essential services to citizens. The Purchasing Section will work to maximize the exposure,
interest, and number of responses on all solicitations.

The Purchasing Ordinance was updated in the Spring of 2012, for the first time in 16 years. With 2013 as our
first full year under the new ordinance, the benefits are continuously being evaluated.
Activity: The Property Section acquires or processes all property, rights of way, easements, licenses, leases,
and other real property needs for the City.
Expectation: The City needs to obtain a variety of property interests including fee simple, leases, easements,
and licenses for a variety of purposes. The Property Section will acquire property interests at a fair and
reasonable cost in a timely, legal, and courteous manner. All property needs will be acquired in accordance
with established timeframes and with a minimal use of the powers of eminent domain.

2012 and 2013 reflect a significant effort to coordinate properties with RTD, which are consolidated in a
small number of broad documents.

General Comments
Property Management continues to work with the Planning Department and the Public Works Department to
improve the efficiency and level of service provided in the review of development applications. Efforts continue
to focus on minimizing the average number of re-submittals necessary for the application to achieve acceptable
standards by improving communications with applicants as to the City's requirements and expectations.
Both Property Management and Purchasing are working with all of the departments to reduce paper copies by
increasing the use of scanning and electronic document exchanges.
The mailroom continues to increase efficiencies and adjust processes in order to offset some of the steadily
increasing postal rates and comply with more stringent automation requirements. This has included
implementation of full Intelligent Mail Barcodes (IMB's), as well as E-Certified (electronically certified) mail.
The Purchasing Section now has all 5 of its full-time staff members certified by the Universal Public Procurement
Certification Council (UPPCC), with 3 Certified Professional Public Buyers (CPPBs) and 2 Certified Public
Procurement Officers (CPPOs).
The Purchasing Section has received its third consecutive Excellence in Achievement award and its first Sterling
Agency Award from the UPPCC (Universal Public Procurement Council).

replacing server hardware.
During 2013-2014, IT updated the City's ezMaps desktop application

asset management services.

General Comments
Trends
- Priority still remains on replacing the City's
obsolete software systems and databases as
funding becomes available. Systems include
utility billing and first-generation web
applications.
- Work with other agencies on regional initiatives
will enhance cooperation between government
agencies and will save taxpayer dollars. The
number of initiatives Lakewood participates in
grows annually. Public safety represents the latest
business area for regional focus.

- Information Technology network expansion over the City's 44 square
miles has raised the need for fiber optic telecommunications
capability.
- The emergence of Next Generation E911 Call Center systems within
the USA and Colorado places additional demands on the City's
network. Needs for resiliency, backup, and regional sharing are
growing.
- New Web self-services are developed where business value exists and
are of popular interest to citizens.
- Cloud-based applications and services are becoming more ubiquitous
and the solutions are starting to be competitive alternatives to
traditional system replacement offerings. Security will remain a
priority regardless of the application delivery method.
- IT is researching the implementation of ITIL in the organization.

General Comments
Total new court cases were again slightly lower in 2013 than in prior years. New summonses in 2014 have
increased. For several reasons, public defender hearings and probation-related hearings continue at a high rate,
keeping court dockets very busy. The Court is investigating the use of additional means of closing cases through
civil actions where the only conditions remaining are financial obligations. The Court also continues to
collaborate with entities outside the City of Lakewood to provide treatment options for offenders.
The Municipal Court is required by the United States Constitution, Amendment VI and the Colorado
Constitution, Article II, Section 16 to provide legal services for indigent individuals. Public defender services
are contracted through a local law firm who represents indigent persons facing a jail sentence.

Investigations

Department: Police
Division:
Investigations
Purpose: The Investigations Division is primarily responsible for conducting follow-up criminal investigations,
collecting, preserving, and analyzing physical evidence, arresting suspects, filing criminal cases, and assisting with
the prosecution of those cases. Four separate sections comprise the Investigations Division: Crimes Against
Persons, Crimes Against Property, Metropolitan Auto Theft Task Force (MATT), and Criminalistics. The sections
are further divided into teams to maximize the need for specialization while maintaining continuity with the Patrol
Division's activities.
The components of the Crimes Against Persons
Section are the Persons Unit, the Juvenile Crime Unit,
the Crimes Against Children Unit, and the Victim
Assistance Unit. This section is responsible for
investigations involving assaults, homicides, sexual
assaults, child abuses, and juvenile delinquency
matters. The Victim Assistance Unit staffed by nonsworn personnel provides direct services and crisis
intervention to victims and witnesses of crimes. The
Victim Assistance Unit administers the Victim
Compensation Fund.
The Crimes Against Property Section consists of the Burglary Unit, Economic Crimes Unit, Special Investigation
Unit, Sex Offender Apprehensions and Registration Team (SOAR) and West Metro Drug Task Force (WMDTF).
In addition to its regular investigative caseload, this section is responsible for gathering criminal intelligence and
conducting background investigations for liquor licenses, towing operators, pawnshops, adult retail businesses, and
massage parlors. The ongoing enforcement of laws relating to vice, liquor, and pawn violations also rests within
this section.
The Lakewood Police Department continues to co-host the multi-agency Metropolitan Auto Theft Task Force.
MATT's mission is to investigate continuing problems caused by auto theft crimes in the Denver metro area.
MATT is funded by the Colorado Auto Theft Prevention Authority and supported by the partnering law
enforcement agencies. MATT utilizes a proactive investigative approach incorporating data sharing and public
education to impact the organized criminal efforts related to auto theft.
The Criminalistics Section is staffed by non-sworn personnel. They provide support service for the evaluation,
processing, and scientific examination of physical evidence. The staff possesses considerable technical expertise
in a wide variety of disciplines including fingerprint comparison, photography, computer analysis, crime scene
reconstruction, and the collection and preservation of evidence. This section also maintains the sex offender
registration files and conducts the registration of convicted sex offenders living in Lakewood.

General Comments
The Investigations Division continues to be impacted by state and federal laws mandating increased enforcement
to include the investigation and handling of domestic violence, fraud, at-risk adult property crimes, identity thefts,
sexual offender registrations, and victim services. Continuing changes in DNA preservation and evidence storage
laws as well as the retention of sexual assault exam kits will also have a significant impact on the Division.
The School Resource Officer (SRO) Program is under the supervision of the Juvenile Crimes Unit. In 2014 and
2015, the SROs will be proactive in the schools teaching law and criminal justice related classes. During summer
breaks, the SROs work with local and state probation officers conducting visits to the homes of juveniles who have
been sentenced to probation for criminal activity or who have school disciplinary problems. These visits reinforce
behaviors expected of students during the school year. The SROs also sponsor the Lakewood Police Department
Youth Police Academy.

361

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

General Comments (continued)
The Investigations Division will continue to maintain public and private professional associations. The Division is
a member of Denver Metro Crime Stoppers and partners with The Ralston House which is dedicated to helping
children and teens heal from the trauma of sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse. It is the only child advocacy
center in Jefferson County.
The Criminal Identification Unit (Crime Lab) is in the process of partially integrating with the new Jefferson
County Regional Crime Lab. The first phase of this integration is the staffing of three fingerprint and forensic
identification specialists, including a supervisor. Later in 2014 and 2015 the department will staff the Quality
Assurance Coordinator position to the new lab. This new, state of the art, crime lab will also provide additional
firearms and ballistics capabilities, as will as DNA analysis.
The workload for the Major Crimes Unit has increased in recent years. The caseload is higher, both objectively in
volume and subjectively in complexity than any other investigative unit in the department. This caseload is
presenting challenges to completing thorough and proper investigation of our citizens most heinous crimes. Due to
a variety of reasons, the responsibilities of the Major Crimes Unit have increased substantially over the years while
the number of detectives have not. Our detectives strive to uphold the agency reputation of excellence within the
law enforcement community but it has become vital we increase our personnel if we are to continue this quality of
service. To this end, a detective position in the Property Crimes Section is being transferred to the Major Crimes
Unit.
The Investigations Division continues to evaluate practices, programs, and technological advancements to ensure
peak effectiveness within the parameters of our available resources. An emphasis on professionalism, excellence
in service, and accountability is an ongoing goal for all members of the Division.

Program: Patrol Services
Department: Police
Division:
Patrol
Purpose: Patrol Services encompasses the types of police activities that are most visible to citizens. These include
responding to citizen's requests for emergency and non-emergency assistance as well as proactive, agent-initiated
activity. The investigation of criminal offenses, the initial documentation, and the apprehension of offenders are
among the primary responsibilities of a Patrol Agent. In addition, considerable time and effort are also devoted to
non-criminal activities that help ensure the safety of individuals and the community in general.
Patrol Services meets the challenges of a more complex society through specialization. The daytime and evening
Traffic Teams provide enforcement, investigation, and education on traffic-related issues. The Mills Team
provides police services to the area surrounding this distinctive retail complex. The Special Enforcement Team
(SET) is designed as a flexible unit that can quickly change focus to address emerging problems such as graffiti or
gang-related issues. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) is capable of responding as a coordinated, highly
trained unit to critical incidents. The Sector Liaison Unit is responsible for administering a variety of crime
prevention programs. Education, directed intervention, mediation, and enforcement are areas of particular focus.
This unit plays a critical role in our community policing efforts. Community Service Officers are non-sworn
employees who are assigned the more routine tasks, thereby freeing Agents for higher priority calls for service.
The Patrol Support Team provides clerical and administrative services for the Division including service and
maintenance needs and staffing the Telephone Reporting Unit.
As the most visible arm of the Police Department, Patrol Services is the primary resource for the Department's
community policing philosophy. The Patrol Division sector-based approach divides the City into two distinct
areas. This allows deployment of personnel geographically so that they better learn about the community they
serve. This encourages effective community partnerships and promotes a problem solving approach to crime and
quality of life issues.

General Comments
The Patrol Division has embraced the premise of Sector-Based Policing. This was derived from the basic tenets
of community policing. It is recognized that the police alone are not the guardians of law and order, and that the
police can be most effective in addressing crime and quality of life issues if they work closely with the
community. It is a collaboration between the police and community that identifies and responds to community
problems with the ultimate goal to reduce crime and increase the citizens' sense of safety, security, and
satisfaction with the Police Department.
The Patrol Division is confident that Sector-Based Policing will continue to be effective as the Division prepares
to respond to the challenges of the future. The challenges in 2015 and beyond include the implementation of a
collaborative, comprehensive program that will address crime and quality of life issues. The initiative relies
heavily on establishing strong community partnerships. Targeted locations will be identified through on-going
crime analysis and may incorporate any or all of the following strategies: Data-Driven Approach to Crime and
Safety (DDACTS), directed crime and traffic enforcement, foot and bicycle patrols, proactive crime measures,
flexible scheduling, and the use of a surveillance camera system.
Improvements to our ability to prevent, detect, investigate, and solve graffiti offenses will continue to be
emphasized throughout our community. Special events will continue to require significant deployment of
personnel in order to preserve a safe and peaceful community.

Goals / Activities / Expectations / Results-Benefits (continued)
Activity: In 2013, a Colorado senate bill was signed into law involving the sealing of criminal conviction
records for petty and municipal offenses. C.R.S. 18-1.3.101 will take effect in 2014 which will require the
court, probation and pre-trial services to advise defendants that their records can be sealed. This new statue
has the potential to dramatically increase the number of Notices of Hearings and Sealing/Expungements. Prior
to this legislation, sealings were limited to non-conviction offenses.
Expectation: This is a dramatic change in the law and will significantly increase the petitions to seal records
that are processed by Records Section. The impact of this legislation will be closely monitored for
compliance with mandates of the new legislation. It is incumbent on the Records Section to review all
pertinent information on the petitioner to ascertain if the criteria is met for sealing the record and if not, file
an objection with the court.
Results-Benefits: The Records Section will document the growth and impact of activity from this new
legislation. Changes in priorities and the reorganization of personnel to meet this mandate will be addressed
in 2015.

Activity: The Crime Analysis Unit is utilized to identify crime patterns, series, and trends to increase and
enhance crime prevention, apprehension, vice enforcement, and street gang interdiction.
Expectations: The Crime Analysis Unit will test and utilize new computer programming to provide enhanced
specific, evidence-based data for focused patrol crime interdiction strategies.
Result-Benefit: Proactive, timely and regular dissemination of crime analysis information relating to trends,
patterns, and serial criminal activity will be completed to increase effectiveness.

Activity: A decision has been made to continue efforts with a consortium of Jefferson County agencies to
implement a regional Records Management System (RMS). Records staff will assist in identifying and

General Comments
The Code Enforcement Unit addresses citizen concerns to improve property conditions. Staff is being proactive
on the major business corridors to address overgrown weeds and trash, and illegal signage concerns. Code
Enforcement will utilize Community Development Block Grant funding to continue revitalization and
neighborhood appearance projects. It will engage in citizen education initiatives to address revised zoning
ordinances and smoking restrictions.
The Communication Section continues to participate in regionalization and consolidation efforts within Jefferson
County. Consolidation of equipment (hardware and software), phone, and logging systems are being explored. A
consultant has been contracted by the Jefferson County Emergency Communications Authority to conduct a
feasibility study of five primary PSAPS and three secondary fire district centers. The study will detail the financial,
personnel, operational and technological consolidation of communication centers and the resulting impact on
service levels to the citizens of Lakewood and participating agencies.
The relocation of the Crime Lab to the new Jefferson County Regionalized Crime Lab will require a modification
of Property Services procedures to accommodate transportation and tracking of evidentiary items to and from the
regional crime lab.
Technology continues to offer opportunities to enhance efficiency of a dynamic and advancing Records Section.
The Records Section will continue to investigate and find software that allows them to excel in their efforts to
research, implement, and improve the maintenance, dissemination, and security of law enforcement records.

General Comments
Staff from this program also work on capital projects in the Sewer, Stormwater, and Water Utilities. When
working on utility projects, staff time is charged to the appropriate utility thus reducing expenditures in this
program.
The major City capital improvement projects anticipated in 2014 and 2015 are intersection improvements at
14th/Lamar and cost sharing on CDOT's Wadsworth Boulevard widening projects from Highland Drive to 14th
Avenue. These projects are funded by approximately $5,800,000 of City money and matched by state and federal
grants of approximately $14,700,000. More detail on these and other projects is provided in the Capital
Improvement and Preservation Program section of the budget.
Constructing sidewalk and bike path connections to the W Rail Line stations will be another major effort in 2014
and 2015. In 2014, construction will begin on a sidewalk on the east side of Lamar between the station and 14th
Avenue. Construction will also begin on pedestrian connections from Zephyr to the Lakewood ●Wadsworth
Station, on Oak from the RTD parcel to Colfax and on Quail from West Rail Road to Colfax. Also, design and
rights-of-way acquisition will start on an additional $2 million dollars of sidewalk projects.

Budget Variances
 Services & Supplies


2014 Budget vs. 2013 Actual is up $580,082 due to reduced vehicle repair and fuel costs in 2013 along
with an increase in vehicle replacement funding in 2014.

 Capital Outlay
 2014 Budget vs. 2013 Actual is up $487,508 due to timing of vehicle and equipment replacements and
anticipated higher costs to replace patrol vehicles.
 2015 Budget vs. 2014 Revised is down $413,000 due to timing of vehicle and equipment replacements.

Goals / Activities / Expectations / Results-Benefits
 GOAL: Maintain public infrastructure and equipment
Activity: The Division performs repair and maintenance work at or above industry standards.
Expectation: Equipment is ready to operate when needed.
Result-Benefit: The Division maintains vehicles and equipment so that they are available more than 95% of
the time.

400

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

Goals / Activities / Expectations / Results-Benefits (continued)
Activity: The Division purchases vehicles and equipment that best meet the needs of City operations.
Expectation: Each vehicle and piece of equipment in the City's fleet will be kept an optimal amount of time
in order to minimize the impact on the equipment replacement budget and the General Fund budget for
repairs and maintenance.
Result-Benefit: The Division will purchase vehicles as needed totaling no more than $1,500,000 in 2015.
 GOAL: Monitor and, when appropriate, utilize alternative fuel sources
Activity: Fuel options are evaluated for environmental benefits and serviceability.
Expectation: The Division understands market and other relevant factors.
Result-Benefit: The fleet transitions to alternative fuels as appropriate.

General Comments
The Fleet Management program supports and maintains the City's vehicles and motorized self-propelled
equipment. The Division maintains over 600 pieces of equipment with 7 mechanics and 2 administrative positions
which is one of the most lean staff/vehicle ratios in the region.
Each piece of equipment is considered for replacement based on age, use, and condition. Acknowledging the
increased quality and longer economic life of many vehicles available today, we are keeping vehicles in the fleet
longer than ever before, with lower maintenance, therefore attempting to reduce capital expenditures from year to
year. Keeping vehicles in the fleet for too long increases general fund expenditures through increased maintenance
and increases the frequency vehicles and equipment are unavailable due to service needs. Each piece of equipment
that is at or near a replacement date is examined to determine if it can economically be retained for a longer time
period, or, alternatively, must be replaced early. In 2015, vehicle and equipment replacements include
replacement of Police and Patrol, Urban and Regional Parks, Code Enforcement and Building Maintenance
vehicles.
Prior to 2002, each program that used vehicles was charged an annual amount to build a fund balance in the
Equipment Replacement Fund. Starting in 2002, funds to replace vehicles used in the General Fund programs are
budgeted in the Capital Improvement Fund to reduce expenses in the General Fund. Enterprise Fund programs
budget for annual charges to replace vehicles in their respective budgets.

stormwater quality requirements, and provide safe driving surfaces.
Result-Benefit:
From April 1 to November 1, arterial and major collector streets are swept an average of once every ten days
and other streets four times per season.
In the winter months, sanded streets are swept an average of once every three weeks as weather conditions
allow. Approximately 34,000 lane miles are swept annually.
 GOAL: Maintain public infrastructure and equipment
Activity: Potholes are repaired permanently and quickly.
Expectation: Potholes are repaired within three working days of being reported and potholes on busy streets
are repaired quicker. Repairs are done in a manner that maximizes the life of the repair. This includes jack
hammering square edges on the repair area, tacking, and properly compacting the new asphalt.

General Comments
City Street Maintenance crews perform day-to-day
repair activities needed to maintain the City street
system. Private contractors are used to perform the
large annual overlay, sealcoat, and concrete repair
programs.

Street sweeping in the winter months is done primarily on sanded snow routes and state highways. The goal is to
remove sand accumulation as soon as possible for safety, air quality, and aesthetic reasons.
Priority 1, 2 and 3 snow routes are plowed and sanded in every storm. Priority routes consist of 247 miles of
streets. The 240 miles of residential streets not included on priority routes are plowed when total snow depth
seriously impedes vehicle mobility and melting is not occurring. In the winter of 2013/2014, no storms required
the plowing of all residential streets. During most snowstorms 26 snowplows are deployed to cover priority routes.
For large snowstorms, an additional 12 to 15 contract motor graders are brought in to assist City crews. In the
winter of 2013/2014, additional contract forces were used to perform sidewalk snow removal around the light rail
stations.

General Comments
Alameda Parkway and Indiana Street and the HAWK Pedestrian Signal on Union Boulevard are the two
additional traffic signals added in 2014.
Traffic signal safety improvements are scheduled for Kipling Parkway and Dartmouth Avenue, Kipling
Parkway and Kentucky Drive, Mississippi Avenue and Wadsworth Boulevard, Mississippi Avenue and Pierce
Street, Wadsworth Boulevard and Mansfield Avenue, Wadsworth Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue and 14th
Avenue and Harlan Street.
New traffic signals will be constructed at Colfax and Harlan and Colfax and Lamar to align with the at grade
crossings for light rail. Signals will be removed at Colfax and Newland and Colfax and Kendall.
Traffic signal system detection and travel time gathering and reporting devices will be installed on Kipling
Street/Parkway to monitor the flow of traffic from 26th Avenue to Belleview Avenue. The federally funded
project will provide additional tools to optimize signal timing.
With the recent completion of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) W Rail line, traffic patterns and
parking practices have changed and will continue to change for some time in the study area. Many of the
Lakewood citizens that live near the West Line have expressed concerns about a variety of transportation
issues. The City of Lakewood completed a traffic study in 2014. The study area generally consists of the area
west of Sheridan Boulevard, east of Oak Street, north of US 6 and south of West Colfax Avenue.
Recommendations from the study are being implemented.

* This cost was totally offset by the dollars received through the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program.

General Comments
The medical Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) plans continued to result in savings for the City during the
2014 annual renewal. These will be continually refined to make cost-effective use of total compensation dollars.

The Department provides guidelines on complying with governmental regulations and City policies. In the coming
years, with the assistance of a consultant, the City will closely manage and monitor compliance of our programs
(particularly the developments of the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act and the Health Care & Education
Reconciliation Act) and continue cost control efforts.

Goals / Activities / Expectations / Results-Benefits (continued)
 GOAL: Appropriate for expected and unexpected special project expenditures
Activity: Separate accounts are managed for each special project in the City and reimbursements are
obtained for these expenditures whenever possible.
Expectation: Costs for certain special projects are tracked on a project by project basis to assure that the
expenses are accurate and reimbursements are obtained whenever possible.
Result-Benefit: Costs of individual projects are tracked and reimbursements are charged back to outside
parties whenever warranted and allowed.

General Comments
Funding for special projects is provided for in this Non-Departmental budget. Expenses include one-time costs
needed to complete special projects.
Through the May 2000 Intergovernmental Agreement between the Town of Morrison and the City of Lakewood,
the City administers the land development reviews, issuance of building permits, maintenance, and services for the
Rooney Valley area. These costs are reflected in the Non-Departmental budget.
Within the Capital Improvement Fund, Open Space Fund, Conservation Trust Fund, Sewer Enterprise Fund,
Stormwater Enterprise Fund, and the Water Enterprise Fund that support capital projects, a budgeted amount may
be anticipated in a contingency line item. The contingency is only for those times when spending for a capital
project is greater than originally anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances. For the 2014 Revised Budget,
capital contingencies are budgeted $500,000 for the Capital Improvement fund and $50,000 in each of the utility
enterprise funds. For the 2015 Budget, capital contingencies are budgeted $50,000 in each of the utility enterprise
funds.

 2014 Revised vs. 2015 Budget is up $9,558,000 due to the City's anticipation of becoming self-insured
for medical in April of 2015. This expense is offset by revenue.

Goals / Activities / Expectations / Results-Benefits
 GOAL: Minimize the City's workers' compensation, physical asset, and general liability losses
through risk management programs and processes that effectively protect employees, citizens, and
assets of the City
Activity: Programs are provided to assist in monitoring and maintaining a safe environment for all
employees and citizens and to protect all physical assets through insurance coverage, processing claims,
mediation, litigation, and maintaining appropriate levels of reserves.
Expectation: Loss prevention and safety training courses are offered to reduce workplace accidents.
Random drug tests and alcohol programs are administered as required by the Department of Transportation
for commercial drivers.
Accurate reporting data is maintained as required by the National Council of Compensation Insurance, State
Workers' Compensation, and state and private insurance auditors.
Result-Benefit: In 2013, Risk Management provided the following classes and programs:
* Loss Control walk throughs were accomplished to alleviate possible risks and behaviors.
* AED's were provided in more locations throughout the city to help save lives
* Blood Borne Pathogens classes were held.
* CPR/AED classes, certifying employees in lifesaving techniques, were held.
* Hepatitis shots were given to Police Personnel to help keep them safe on the job.
* Back Attack Classes informed employees on the proper techniques in lifting and proper care of one's
back.
* Defensive driving, blood drives, respiratory equipment, and flu shots were provided.

City of Lakewood 2015 Budget

General Comments
The City has a self-insurance program to pay for expected and unexpected losses that occur in the course of
delivering municipal government services. By self-insuring, the City has saved a significant amount of money
over the years compared to the traditional approach of purchasing full insurance or being a member of an
insurance pool.
Operating as a self-insured requires that the City maintain an appropriate fund reserve to cover its losses from
year to year. The City is also required to maintain a reserve of funds in the event that the City incurs an unusually
high number of claims or high payouts on claims. In addition, an appropriate fund reserve is mandated by the
State of Colorado in order to maintain a permit to operate as self-insured. Forecasting the amount of money the
City needs in the self-insurance fund is determined through an actuarial study conducted by an independent
actuary. Every two years such a study is conducted. From this study, a reserve fund level is established for the
new period and the proper reserve fund level is maintained.
An increase in property inventory, property values, programs, and employees increases the potential for claims
and thereby impacts the actuarial predictions of frequency and severity of claims and the amount of money
needed in reserve in the self-insurance fund. These changes affect the self-insurance fund level, which in turn
affects the ability to meet the program goal, which is to protect the assets of the City.
The cost of insurance continues to rise in all arenas, including property, fiduciary liability, and workers'
compensation. The self-insurance program will continue to stay up to date on this trend and keep management
and citizens informed in order to budget for these rising costs in the future.

Raadios are over 10 years old and
a their designn life is sevenn years. Currennt PD mobile raadios
haave not been manufactured for the past several years. Identical spaares are becom

problematic at times. In 2015, first respponders will bbe transitioninng to the TD
