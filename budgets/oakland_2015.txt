Mission Statement
The City of Oakland is committed to the delivery of effective, courteous and
responsible service. Citizens and employees are treated with fairness, dignity
and respect.
Civic and employee pride are accomplished through constant pursuit of
excellence and a workforce that values and reflects the diversity of the
Oakland community.

The Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) presented a
Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the City of Oakland for its biannual budget for the fiscal
years 2011-12 and 2012-13.
In order to receive this award, a governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets
program criteria as a policy document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan and as a
communications device.
The award is valid for a period of one budget cycle only. We believe our current budget for fiscal
years 2013-14 and 2014-15, continues to conform to program requirements, and we are submitting
it to GFOA to determine its eligibility for another award.

FISCAL YEAR 2013-15 ADOPTED BUDGET FOR THE CITY OF OAKLAND

Honorable Mayor Quan, City Council and Residents of Oakland:
On behalf of the entire City Administration, I am transmitting the City of Oakland’s Adopted Policy
Budget for the period of July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2015.
This budget represents a crossroads for Oakland. Our economy is on the rise, and we see many
opportunities ahead to realize our vision of success, safety and stability for our city. We have worked to
balance the priorities and needs of everyone in the City, and we believe this is a "fair share" budget for
all. The City is investing strongly in public safety and economic development to restore the police force
and build on the economic opportunities before us. Due to growing expenses beyond our control, we are
still forced to propose some cuts and position eliminations, but we have worked hard to minimize them.
Significant employee contributions made over four years ago, at the height of the recession, will begin to
sunset starting in July 2013. For several years now, our employees have given contributions that were
critical to stabilizing the City and creating an environment where we can now make thoughtful, though
urgent, decisions about our future. We are grateful to all City employees, whose sacrifices have been
essential to stabilizing the City’s service levels and finances, and resuming our economic growth.
Looking ahead, we will have to continue the partnership to make smart, tough decisions together about
how we move forward to tackle our challenges and seize the great opportunities before us.
While we have weathered fiscal storms and made substantial progress, there are factors beyond our local
control that pose big challenges for balancing this two-year budget in the short term and ensuring our
financial stability in the long term. It is crucial that we prepare now to address anticipated increases in
expenditures. Our recent economic gains have been offset and outpaced by the following factors:
•
•
•
•
•

Federal and state funding cuts;
Rising health care costs;
Rapidly growing costs of employee pensions as the CalPERS funding system undergoes
necessary reform;
Sun-setting of local tax measures; and,
Expiring public safety grants worth millions of dollars.

The recent economic growth had helped us to increase the City’s services in the following programs:








Graduate two police academies each year and increase sworn officers from 633 in FY 2012-13 to
707 by June 2015 (10 of which are funded by the newly received COPS grant after the budget
adoption);
Graduate at least two fire academies in year two;
Provide funding in the amount of $1.5 million in FY 2013-14 to backfill cuts to the Headstart
program due to federal sequestration (this amount is not funded for FY 2014-15);
Provide funding of $1.8 million to backfill the affordable housing program cut due to both the
dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency by the state and the federal sequestration in FY 201415;
Increase civilian personnel at the Police Department by 38 positions;
Increase civilian personnel throughout departments by 41.2 positions to restore some of the
services to keep Oakland clean and safe; and,
Restore one fire engine that had been “browned out.”

BUDGET SUMMARY
The FY 2013-15 Adopted Policy Budget contains two-year appropriations of approximately $2 billion,
comprised of approximately $1 billion for FY 2013-14 and approximately $1 billion for FY 2014-15,
across all funding sources. The General Purpose Fund accounts for approximately 40% of the City’s total
budget at approximately $450 million each year. Funds comprising the remainder of the City’s budget
are restricted for special purposes, such as grant programs, sewer services, bond-funded projects, capital
projects, and debt payments.

MAYOR’S AND COUNCIL’S PRIORITIES
Oakland is a diverse city that is home to a wide array of different communities and individuals. In many
cases, that means our residents and businesses sometimes have differing and even conflicting priorities.
The job of leadership is to serve all of Oakland, and to resolve those differences in a way that best serves
our collective needs and goals. The FY 2013-15 Adopted Policy Budget was built on the priorities set
forth by the Mayor and the City Council:

Mayor Jean Quan’s Priorities
 Invest in public safety
 Create jobs and promote economic
development
 Bolster job-training services so that
Oaklanders are a competitive and thriving
workforce

City Council’s Priorities
(Resolution #84466 C.M.S.)
A Safe City – a City in which safety is defined
by more than just police

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL AND OAKLAND RESIDENTS

Mayor Jean Quan’s Priorities
 Build and restore our infrastructure and the
physical environment of Oakland

 Foster Oakland youth and care for our most
vulnerable populations
 Achieve long-term fiscal stability for the City
 A City that honors and respects its employees
– restoring Employee Contributions and
Furlough Days

Page 3

City Council’s Priorities
(Resolution #84466 C.M.S.)
A Clean City – A City in which we swiftly
address quality of life issues such as graffiti,
blight, and illegal dumping in all of our
neighborhoods
A Livable City – A City that respects and
provides safe space for its children and seniors
A City that honors and respects its employees –
restoring Employee Contributions and Furlough
Days

All these priorities weave a cohesive strategy, and by working together we will move Oakland forward.
Our vision for Oakland is to dramatically bring down crime and strongly increase safety for our residents
and businesses. This will encourage new businesses and investors, and bolster the businesses we already
have, which in turn will produce new jobs, increase prosperity in our neighborhoods and create more
revenue to support City services. With greater revenues, we can improve quality of life for everyone in
our city, and better fund services for our most vulnerable residents, making stable, steady progress toward
prosperity.
BUDGET-BALANCING PRINCIPLES
During the development of this budget, we adhered to the following budgeting principles:
Principle 1:

Principle 2:
Principle 3:

Principle 4:
Principle 5:
Principle 6:
Principle 7:
Principle 7:

Achieve a long-term structurally balanced budget through efficiencies, permanent
reductions to the expenditure base, and/or revenue enhancements. Minimize reliance on
reserves or the use of one-time revenues for ongoing expenditures.
Give highest priority to protecting the most essential City services.
Maintain an open and transparent process for City employees and the public. Public
involvement shall be encouraged in the budget decision-making process through public
hearings, public outreach, and information.
Minimize the negative impact on Oakland residents, businesses and employees.
Help strengthen the City's position in the financial and capital markets.
Develop a long-term plan to address negative fund balances.
General Fund revenues shall not be earmarked for any particular purpose, unless required
by law or generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
All Enterprise Funds shall work to become fully self-supporting from revenues generated
by rates, fees, and charges.

KEY BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS
Collective Stakeholder Contributions
The City could not have achieved its state of relative health without three crucial factors: employee
contributions, service reductions, and growing revenues. The first two factors were the result of incredible
dedication, hard work, negotiation and leadership on the part of every City stakeholder, including the
employees themselves and the City Council.

Every City employee has faced the difficulty of losing approximately 9% of their compensation, a
sacrifice that is never easy to make. Mayor Quan took and has maintained a 25% cut in her own salary
upon taking office. This was partly an effort to honor the hard work of all public servants and the
sacrifices they were asked to make. In the last fiscal year alone, employee contributions equalled
approximately $37 million. These contributions saved jobs and allowed the City to sustain vital services
for residents.
Weathering the Financial Storm
In addition to employee contributions, we have made great strides during the Great Depression to stabilize
the City’s finances, which has required significant and in many cases unsustainable service reductions
and/or eliminations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
•

Reduced the workforce by 21% over the past 10 years, resulting in the elimination of about 720
positions;
Closed $318 million in cumulative budget shortfalls;
Instituted rolling brown-outs of two fire engine companies;
Reduced sworn police staffing by 27% (from 837 to 611 officers) and civilian staff by 34% in the last
6 years (from 394 to 261 FTEs), with loss of services in patrol, shortage of investigative resources,
delayed response to 911 calls for service, and elimination of the horse-mounted \ and traffic units;
Significantly reduced paving and street repairs;
Reduced code enforcement, development, and planning staff;
Reduced Cultural Arts programs and grants, and Film Office staffing;
Significantly reduced various neighborhood improvement and beautification programs, such as:
façade and tenant improvement grants, the Neighborhood Project Initiative Program, graffiti
abatement (private property), blight removal, litter and illegal dumping response, tree trimming,
sidewalk maintenance, and open space maintenance;
Reduced affordable housing programs and funding for homeless programs;
Reduced park, median and grounds and building maintenance and custodial services.

We have pursued various ways to maximize revenue by: (1) pursuing grants from federal and state
governments as well as foundations and the private sector, (2) aggressively pursuing dollars owed the
City through special revenue collection efforts, (3) developing more public/private partnerships, and (4)
increasing fees to fully recover the costs related to providing services. The results of a growing economy
and aggressive revenue development efforts have proven fruitful.
Over the past five years, the City has made significant strides in stabilizing its financial condition, and the
City Council, residents, and employees have played a major role in getting the City to a stronger fiscal
condition. The following fiscal actions that have strengthened our financial standing:
• Instituted strong fiscal controls and strengthened financial policies;
• Proactively collected revenues and implemented targeted efforts to collect past-due funds;
• Paid down negative fund balances, which have gone from $138 million to about $105 million at the
close of FY 2012-2013 (this is internal debt that comes from inter-fund borrowing);
• Fully funded the General Fund reserve to meet the level mandated by City Council policy for the first
time in five years;
• Reorganized to reduce costs and enhance efficiency; and,
• Planned for anticipated additional fiscal impacts from the dissolution of Redevelopment.

Accomplishments
Working with all stakeholders, we have:









Closed the budget shortfalls;
Minimized layoffs and service reductions;
Rehired all the laid-off police officers who wanted to return, and awarded a grant for 25 new officers;
Funded the first police academy in more than four years and proposed more;
Significantly paid down debt;
Maintained AA credit ratings through multiple reviews by raters/investors;
Supported modest, steady revenue increases; and,
Brought down unemployment from 16.6% in January 2011 to 10.7% in October 2013.

Ready for Growth
The good news is that the economy is showing steady signs of modest recovery, the housing market is red
hot, and key economic indicators are trending in a positive direction: unemployment is down and
revenues are up in most categories (e.g., property tax, sales tax, business tax, real estate tax).
The financial markets are taking notice of Oakland’s judicious approach to address both short-term and
long-term financial challenges: just recently, the credit-rating agencies reaffirmed our AA credit rating
and noted our stable fiscal outlook.
Looking forward, we must continue to grow our revenues to restore and enhance services to the
community. We have actively supported long-dormant projects which have recently sprung to life, and
are working to spur progress on other projects to draw investment to Oakland, creating more jobs and
more economic development. Recent progress includes:
 Starting construction at the Oakland Army Base, which includes constructing a new marine terminal
and 1 million square feet of trade and logistics space that will generate approximately 2,000 jobs;
 Supporting efforts to break ground in spring 2014 at the Brooklyn Basin Project, which includes 3,100
units of housing, 30 acres of open space, and 200,000 square feet of commercial space, with an
approximate job count of 8,000 over the 6 to 8 year build-out of the project;
 Completing the “10K” housing project started a decade ago and strategically positioning Oakland for
“10K 2.0, ” which would build housing across all of Oakland's transit corridors;
 Continuing to negotiate exciting opportunities for our sports facilities and the world-class potential of
the Coliseum City development project; and
 Aggressively pursuing retail projects. Since 2011, more than 1 million square feet of new or improved
leasable retail space have been completed or are in the pipeline.
Factors Outside of the City’s Control
Despite the good work we’ve done putting our fiscal house in order, outside financial forces are creating
new challenges going forward. We face some significant losses, and some expenses are rising even faster
than our revenues, but three primary factors affect our fiscal status:

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL AND OAKLAND RESIDENTS
Subject: FY 2013-2015 Adopted Policy Budget
Date: December 2013

Page 6

1. Ongoing Impacts of the Global Recession
Oakland continues to be challenged by the lingering impacts of the global recession and the harsh service
impacts which resulted from reducing $318 million in expenditures and losing 720 FTEs in prior years,
while simultaneously planning for additional reductions.
We have begun recovery, but have not yet fully restored our pre-recession revenues. A good example of
these ongoing points of recovery is sales tax, a central revenue source for California cities. Although
Oakland sales tax revenues are on the rise, they remain 8% lower than their pre-recession highs.
Although revenues are showing modest, upward trends, continuously rising costs and deferred
expenditures are projected to outpace revenue growth, mostly due to steep increases in health care and
pension costs and critical deferred maintenance to repair City buildings and roads, upgrade technology,
and replace fleet and equipment.
2. Increased Cost of Benefits
CalPERS’ newly adopted actuarial assumptions will have a significant impact on the City’s budget.
In the coming year, we face a 21% increase in CalPERS costs, or about $14 million. Over the next five
years, the estimated pension cost will be $107.6 million in FY 2017-18 compared with $66.5 million in
FY 2012-13, an increase of 61.8% within a five-year period.
The City must also prepare to pay increased costs for medical benefits above the estimated $41 million
we now pay. These costs have increased by 39% per civilian employee since FY 2006-07, and by 50% for
sworn employees. While CalPERS has not published projected cost increases for 2014, the past increases
are a reasonable indicator of anticipated increases in the coming years.
These rising costs are currently projected to outpace the City’s economic growth and steadily rising
revenues.
3. Dissolution of Redevelopment
Redevelopment was a major tool that Oakland—like other urban centers in California—could use to turn
vacant and underutilized properties into productive, tax revenue-generating and job-producing use. It
served as a catalyst for private investment to breathe life into areas burdened with deteriorated buildings,
environmental contamination, and aging infrastructure that would otherwise lay vacant and
nonproductive.
The elimination of Redevelopment in January 2012 created a $28 million hole in the City’s budget and
eliminated a significant source of ongoing funding for affordable housing and blight abatement, including
resource to combat graffiti and illegal dumping. Redevelopment had also been partly used to help fund
police services in commercial areas slated for revitalization.
4. Federal Sequestration and Potential Further Reductions
The federal government has imposed sequestration as part of the federal budget-balancing measure. The
immediate impact to Oakland is reduction of vital services for vulnerable populations, including
significant cuts to Head Start programs and affordable housing programs. The current federal budget
resolution appropriates the federal spending up to January 15, 2014 and debt ceiling is suspended through

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL AND OAKLAND RESIDENTS

Date: December 2013

Page 7

February 7, 2014. We can’t predict what other acts the federal government will take next year to balance
the budget.
Strategies and Values
We’ve worked to be transparent and collaborative. This is an open, community-focused process with
the books open to anyone who wants to see the data. By letting everyone have unprecedented access to
our budget data we know we can: (1) improve trust in the process, (2) create a budget that truly serves
everyone, and (3) tap into the best ideas available by empowering everyone in Oakland to contribute their
ideas and perspectives.
In recent years, we reorganized to increase efficiency, reduced middle management, and in many cases
cut services to the bone. We now face choices moving forward about rebuilding and restoring a few key
services. While all City service areas require our attention, we have given particular focus to the areas of
public safety, economic development, and clean Oakland. By building a safer Oakland and growing
our economy, we will create a better foundation on which to restore and grow the City as a whole.
We’re in this together. We will build on union partnerships and continue to collaborate with all
stakeholders. A series of town hall meetings had been held throughout Oakland during the budget
development to discuss the City’s fiscal condition and proposed Policy Budget, and the City Council had
held numerous public hearings on the proposed budget.
Balancing priorities. Tough choices lie ahead. Everyone’s priorities are important, and we have made
every effort to respect and champion the collective expectations, needs and goals of the people and
employees of Oakland.
Oakland at a Crossroads
It is clear that the City is at a critical juncture. The decisions we make now are pivotal to our future and to
realizing the full promise of Oakland. The city has won recent international recognition, and with our
economy on the rise, we are well positioned for growth. Great opportunities are before us and we are
within reach of a prosperous, bright future.
However, to get there, we must deal directly with our remaining challenges. The most urgent, immediate
priority is to reduce crime and enhance economic development. This adopted budget funds the graduation
of four police academies over the next two fiscal years and brings police sworn staffing to 707 by the end
of FY 2014-2015.
As we tackle police staffing shortages in the near term, we must also keep our eyes sharply focused on the
horizon to ensure that our long-term financial issues are addressed without “kicking the can” further down
the road.
For Oakland to truly flourish, we must begin to confront the imbalance between revenues and
expenditures. This will take systematic planning, difficult trade-offs, patience, and will to create
sustainable, long-term solutions that provide relief from the shortfalls predicted for the future, absent a
permanent solution. Among our upcoming challenges are:


Two major tax measures will sunset in the coming years: Measure Y, which largely funds police
officers and community-based violence prevention service, amongst other services, as well as the
Wildfire Prevention Assessment District, which provides for the ongoing safety needs necessary

to preventing another firestorm such as the one Oakland endured in 1991. Renewal of these
measures requires voter approval. As a result, we need to begin problem-solving over the next
fiscal year to stabilize these services and funding should they not be renewed;
Prepare for the reforms that CalPERS will put in place over the next six years that will have a
significant fiscal impact;
Prepare to implement the Affordable Care Act during the term of this proposed budget, with asyet unknown fiscal impacts and many unresolved questions;
Still absorbing the impact of the loss of Redevelopment;
Five years of structural deficit is forecasted; and
Approximately $1.4 billion of unfunded liabilities and/or deferred capital projects projected.

It will also be critical to bolster our dialogue with the broader Oakland community. The dialogue will
have to include the possibility of a modest parcel tax the voters could approve to accelerate the restoration
of staffing our police department. While the City has been prudent in setting its financial house in order,
we do not have a clear path to reach adequate police staffing without voters playing a part in funding that
restoration. We have begun to heal from the devastating effects of the Great Recession, but that growth is
modest and arriving at a pace that does not allow the fast action many residents are demanding.
Oakland is like many other California cities and cities across the United States that have grappled with
multi-year service reductions and budget shortfalls to a point where there are no longer any discretionary
services left to eliminate. It’s no longer about “doing more with less” or hoping for a full recovery. It is
about acknowledging that we have weathered a very bad fiscal storm, putting strong fiscal measures in
place that have shown positive results, and understanding what the future holds for our City and what we
must plan for in the very near term.
We are not alone in these challenges; however, we must remember that the progress we have made over
the past five years has been a direct result of this City’s dogged determination to work together, with
resolve and collective passion for the well-being and viability of our community. Through ongoing
collaboration and problem-solving, we will find solutions to the challenges before us, and we are
confident that these decisions will allow Oakland to emerge stronger than ever.
BUDGET FOR THE FUTURE
While the biennial budget addresses a two-year period, effectively managing our government’s finances is
a year-round activity. We will continue to work to protect core services through financially responsible
decisions, and we know our work will not be completed with this budget. We face historical, cumulative
financial challenges, uncertainty in the economy, and the federal budget status. But we will continue to
work throughout this budget cycle to ensure City government is focused on providing needed services and
remaining financially healthy now and for years to come.
To that end, the City will continue the ongoing development and extension of multi-year forecasting of
expenditures and revenues. We are focused on enhancing our long-term budget planning processes and
will work to refine the five-year budget projections.
CONCLUSION
The Adopted Policy Budget for FY 2013-15 reflects the Mayor and City Council priorities that invest in
public safety, a clean city, and economic development, and restore some of the critical City services that
were cut during the Great Recession. We will continue to work on long-term financial reform to strike a
long-term balance of our resources and service needs.

FY 2013-2015 BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS
I. BUDGET-BALANCING PRINCIPLES
The following budget-balancing principles were used to develop budget proposals and present the City Council
with a proposed Policy Budget: essentially, they guide expenditure priorities and impacts. These budgetbalancing principles are largely the same as presented in the past (January 2012) and have worked to stabilize our
limited public funds and investment in essential services:

Develop a budget that balances the City's delivery of the most essential services to the community with the
resources available.
Comply with Court rulings and orders, such as the dissolution of Redevelopment and Negotiated Settlement
Agreement.
Resolve shortfalls with ongoing revenue to fund ongoing expenditures. Align one-time resources with onetime costs for programs or projects. To the greatest extent possible, one-time resources should not be used
for ongoing costs.
Minimize the negative impact of service reductions/eliminations on Oakland residents, businesses, and
employees.
General Purpose Fund revenues shall not be earmarked for any particular purpose, unless required by law or
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
All Enterprise Funds shall work to become fully self-supporting from revenues generated by rates, fees and
charges.
Ensure that services address the diverse community and preserve efforts that the City Council has put in
place to address social equity and access to quality of life services.
Rates, fees and charges should become fully cost recovering and the General Purpose Fund should not
provide subsidies, unless authorized by the City Council and funds are appropriately allocated/appropriated.
Ensure that budget-balancing approaches have no negative impact, or minimal impact, on future budgets to
ensure high standards of fiscal integrity and management, along with the goal and interest of preserving the
City’s credit ratings.
Focus on services for both the short- and long-term that are unique to what a full-service local government
should offer. As a goal, analyze all existing services and target service consolidations, reductions, or
eliminations in areas where service is less essential.
Explore personnel services cost savings, subject to the meet-and-confer process where applicable.
Make every effort, if operationally feasible, to eliminate vacant positions, rather than filled positions, to
minimize the number of employee layoffs while at the same time being mindful of the services that the
community demands and/or needs. As programs are consolidated, reduced or eliminated, ensure that
management and administration are reduced as appropriate.
Defer any new program commitments and initiatives or program expansions, unless those programs reduce
crime, stimulate the local economy, create jobs, are cost neutral, generate new revenues, are required by
law, have a significant return on investment for the General Purpose Fund, and/or are funded through
redeployment of existing resources.
Explore interdepartmental/interagency partnerships to leverage service delivery models.

II. FINANCIAL/ECONOMIC MARKET CONSIDERATIONS
Consistent with national, state, and regional economic market trends, the City of Oakland economy is showing
signs of stabilization and modest growth.
Key Oakland Economic Indicators at a Glance
Recent economic indicators confirm modest economic recoveries for Oakland:






Vacancy rates have decreased across all commercial sectors, with the industrial sector falling to its
lowest ever of 4.7%. Commercial and retail vacancy rates are declining.1
From calendar years 2009 to 2012, retail sales increased 23.1%. In calendar year 2012, the gain in
taxable retail sales from 2011 alone increased by 7.6%.2
In calendar year 2012, the City experienced a net increase of 5.3% (823 net new) Residential and
commercial businesses in Oakland (non-rental businesses).3
Property transfers continue on an upward trend. In 2012, there was an average of 749 transfers per
month for all properties, compared with 712 per month in 2011.4
Employment in Oakland in January 2012 was 175,100; in January 2013, employment grew to 181,500,
for a net gain of 6,400 jobs.5

Housing Market Activity
Oakland’s housing market is complex. The rate of foreclosure activities has significantly decreased in Oakland.
However, there are still many Oakland residents in or at risk for foreclosure and the number of underwater
borrowers is also high. Notices of Default have decreased 64.1% since the prior year, and the rate of short sales
has increased 35% from 2011 to 2012.6 Like state and national trends, the number of short sales in Oakland has
impacted the market. Additionally the significant number of foreclosed home purchases by investors has also
contributed to higher home prices and a larger rental market.
Additionally, newly constructed condominium units that were converted to rental units are now returning to the
sale market. Vacancy rates in rental markets are low, with rents rising. According to the data published by real
estate trends site Realtor.com, the average U.S. home spent 84 days on the market last month. In 10 housing
markets, homes spent 48 days or less on the market before being sold. In Oakland, homes spent just 24 days on
the market. 7
In terms of new housing, construction starts remain slow, but major housing developments proposed in Oakland
are expected to come on line in the next several years. For example, Brooklyn Basin Development (Oak to Ninth
development), along the Embarcadero adjacent to Jack London Square, where construction will begin in spring
2014, will contain 3,100 new units of housing, as well as 30 acres of open space and 200,000 square feet of
commercial space. The City is positioned now for a “10k 2.0” initiative.

Over the past year, 6,400 jobs were created in Oakland compared to 5,000 jobs created in the previous year. 8
The unemployment rate in the Oakland-Fremont-Hayward MD was 8.0% in February 2013, down from 8.6% in
January 2013, and below the year-ago estimate of 9.5%. This compares with an unadjusted unemployment rate of
9.7% for California and 8.1% for the nation during the same period. The unemployment rate was 8.0% in
Alameda County, and 8.1% in Contra Costa County.
Two major development projects are expected to add significantly to employment in the City over the next two
years. The construction of a new marine terminal and one million square feet of trade and logistics space at the
former Oakland Army Base, which will begin in December 2013, is expected to create approximately two
thousand new jobs over the course of its build out. In addition, the Brooklyn Basin Development referenced above
will create approximately 8,000 jobs over the six to eight year build out of the project, which will begin in spring
2014. At the same time, the City currently has about 1 million sq. feet of retail development underway which will
have a positive impact on jobs, as reported by the San Francisco Business Times.
Taxable Sales Activity
The country’s major economic recession in 2008 has had a significant impact on retailing, and the sector is still
recovering. In Oakland overall, retail sales had been relatively flat from 2001 to 2004, increased notably from
2004 to 2007, declined in 2008 and 2009, and have been increasing again in 2010 and 2011.
Retail sales activity in 2012 is continuing to show improvement and on an upward trend. Eating and drinking and
convenience retailing have shown the largest increases and strongest recovery, while department and apparel sales
have lagged and have not recovered as quickly. Retail sales are anticipated to continue growing over the next
several years as the economy and consumer confidence continue to recover and grow. Per HdL Economist Jordan
Levine, auto sales activity is a good economic indicator for consumer confidence – in Oakland, auto sales are
strong – all Oakland auto dealerships are part of Oakland’s top 30 sales tax producers. 9

OAKLAND WEATHERING ITS FINANCIAL CHALLENGES: 2008-2013

The City of Oakland is steadily emerging from the recession and collapse of the housing market in 2008. Since
then, the City has addressed $318 million in budget shortfalls caused by sharp revenue declines and eliminated
720 full-time equivalent positions.
Workforce and Community Service Reductions
Over the past 10 years, the City’s workforce has shrunk by about 20% to an all-time low of 3,680 employees.
Although the City has tried to sustain service levels despite diminishing staff and resources, the reality is that
losing 20% of our staff has had a significant impact on service delivery. And yet, the demand for services has
only increased as a result of growing community needs that are heightened during a recession. Adding to the
challenge, we have preserved front-line services by dramatically cutting internal service departments such as
information technology, finance, and human resources, which are critical to sustaining quality community
services. We must seek a better balance moving forward between workload capacity and services delivered.

Past Short-Term and Long-Term Cost-Cutting Measures
The City’s sworn and civilian employees have made significant contributions to help bridge multi-million
shortfalls. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements, City employee’s wages were reduced and all
employees are now contributing the full employee share of pension costs. Current labor agreements that include
these cost-cutting concessions are set to begin expiring in June 2013. Examples of austerity and cost-cutting
measures to address the $318 million in cumulative shortfalls since July 2008 include the following:

Eliminated façade improvement grants, graffiti
abatement and illegal dumping programs
Transferred eligible expenditures to restricted
funds, freeing up General Fund dollars

Sold surplus property and land

Maximizing Revenue
The City has pursued ways to maximize revenue. State law limits the City’s ability to levee new taxes, so the only
means of increasing revenues without voter approval is to raise fees associated with certain City services. By law,
these fees can only cover the City’s actual cost to provide the service (e.g., the City cannot make a profit from
basic service fees). To maximize revenue, the City has employed a variety of strategies, which have significantly
yielded results, such as:




Page 4

Pursued grants from federal and state governments as well as foundations and the private sector;
Aggressively pursued dollars owed the City through special revenue collection efforts;
Developed more public/private partnerships; and,
Increased fees to fully recover the costs related to providing services.

Instituted strong fiscal controls and strengthened financial policies;
Maintained solid credit ratings which reflect strong financial management practices, a deep and
diversified economic base, positive cash flows and liquidity levels, and healthy general fund reserves;
Fully funded the General Fund reserve to meet the level mandated by City Council policy for the first
time in five years;
Paid down 28% of our negative fund balances, which have gone from $138 million to $105 million over a
three-year period (this is internal debt that results in borrowing between funds); and,
Planned for anticipated additional fiscal impacts from the dissolution of Redevelopment and compliance
costs associated with the Negotiated Settlement Agreement.

BUDGET CHALLENGES

Oakland faces uncertainties when it comes to financial planning; these include:


Implementation of the Negotiated Settlement Agreement (NSA) and police staffing; and,
Potential liabilities.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS

A Capital Improvement Program (CIP) represents a major investment in a city's infrastructure and
assets. It must balance repair and replacement of existing assets with delivering new assets where they
may be needed. It must reflect the overall priorities of the City. It has a huge impact on the health and
vibrancy of the community.
Capital projects are defined as a long-term investment that builds, replaces or improves an asset
(buildings, roads, parks, sewer and drainage lines, technology systems, etc.) and that has a useful design
life of at least ten years and a minimum cost of $50,000. Oakland's Capital Improvement Program (CIP)
is formally reviewed and approved every two years, as part of the biennial policy budget.

FY 2013-2015 BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Page 5

ATTACHMENT
There are limited sources of internal funding available for capital improvements, typically with
restrictions on their use within broad categories, described below. Grants are another source of funding
for capital projects. While often a major source of capital funding, they are even more limited, typically
competitive and cyclical in nature.
Internal Sources: The following are the major sources of funding for capital investment in Oakland:





Sewer Service Fund (Fund 3100). Limited to funding maintenance and capital improvements to
the sanitary sewer collection system.
Measure B - Transportation (Fund 2211). Limited to funding transportation and traffic safety
improvements within the public right-of-way.
Measure B - Bicycle and Pedestrian (Fund 2212). Limited to funding bicycle and pedestrian
safety and accessibility improvements within the public right-of-way.
Vehicle Registration Fee (Fund 2215). Limited to funding transportation and traffic safety
improvements within the public right-of-way.

Grant Sources: Additionally, Oakland aggressively pursues grant opportunities for various capital
improvements. While by their nature these grants are only available for specific projects and purposes,
they do represent a significant addition to local funds. They represent the most viable source to fund new
improvements and allow internal funds to be kept available for existing assets.
In the period including the last two fiscal years to date, staff successfully applied for and received a total
of $36 million in grants for 29 capital projects. Staff will continue to seek grants when projects are
competitive and meet the City's need to address unfunded priorities.
A total of $87.8 million is recommended for investment in 27 projects, summarized here:






Buildings and Facilities — 7 projects, $1.4 million
Sewers — 12 projects, $29.1 million
Streets, Sidewalks — 10 projects, $19.6 million
Traffic Improvements — 5 projects, $4.5 million
Garage Improvements — 3 projects, $33.2 million (subject to State Approval of Redevelopment
disposition)

Like many older cities, Oakland has an aging infrastructure and a significant backlog of deferred
maintenance. The proposed CIP includes funding for only a small portion of this backlog or need,
reflecting the limits of existing fund sources. Because of this, a strategic approach to prioritizing the
remaining unmet needs is needed. Such an approach will necessarily require an assessment of core City
programs, the assets needed to deliver those programs, a condition assessment of those City's assets, and
a long-term funding approach to addressing those assets considered critical to core functions and future
growth.
Equipment/Vehicles
The City of Oakland fleet has a current replacement value of $105.0 million with an average annual
capital funding requirement of $10.2 million in current dollars. Due to the high number of vehicles
Page 6

FY 2013-2015 BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

ATTACHMENT
currently overdue for replacement, immediate funding needs are high with normal cyclical patterns
afterward. In FY 2013-15, the City will purchase $11.8 million in new vehicles.
Information Technology
A Capital Improvement Program (CIP) represents a major investment in a City's Information
Technology infrastructure and services. It must maintain, operate and support existing Information
Technology architecture in order to provide the necessary services for internal and external City
customers. It must reflect the overall priorities of the City. It has a huge impact on public safety,
economic development and day to day efficiencies of City government.
Capital projects are defined as a long-term investment that builds and replaces critical technical
infrastructure (911 systems, public safety, telecommunications, payroll, etc.) and has a useful design life
of three to five years. Staff identified 29 critical projects in an amount of $85.23 million in the next five
years that are in need of upgrade, purchase, and maintenance, but they are not funded. Examples are:


Infrastructure Improvements – Includes Citywide email replacement, Document and Records
Management system, Network Security, and End-User computer devices (replacements laptops and
desktops).



Enterprise Application Services – (Oracle Release 12 upgrade) Payroll, Advanced Benefits,
Advanced Collections and Universal Content Management system.



Public Safety Radio System – provides for additional sites which will enhance coverage in the field
and within buildings.



Data Center Improvements – continuity of operations in a major disaster scenario, which requires
having a redundant data center site for preservation of data.



Accela Fire Prevention – Fire plan checks and inspections are currently handled on a separate system
from Accela (CEDA). Implementation of the Accela Fire module will allow for one platform to
handle inspections and permits and provide more transparency by allowing citizens to schedule
inspections, apply for a permit and print out permits from a centralized point online.

POLICY TRADEOFFS & SERVICE BUYBACKS
Restoration of Expenditures Cuts & Policy Decisions on
Possible Expanded Funding of Priority Services
RESTORATION OF EXPENDITURE CUTS
The FY 2013-15 Proposed Policy Budget included a number of service and position reductions relative to FY 2012-13,
which were required as baseline expenditures were growing faster than baseline revenues. While City Council
restored and/or provided funding for some service and position reductions, there are a number of items which
remain outstanding. To the extent that the City Council eliminates expenditures included in the FY 2013-15 Adopted
Policy Budget, cost savings are realized, or additional revenues are identified, the City Council can use those
expenditures or new revenues to restore proposed service reductions in order to maintain existing service levels.
Below is a list of key City services and positions that were reduced or excluded in the adopted budget due to fiscal
constraints that we would recommend restoring if additional revenue or expenditure reductions is recognized.
Note that in some cases, the ongoing costs discussed below, which are based on FY 2012-13 or FY 2013-14 values, do
not include City Council approved Cost of Living Adjustments of 2% in FY 2013-14 and 1% in FY2014-15.

CUTS FOR POSSIBLE RESTORATION
Fire Prevention Inspector
The civilian Fire Prevention Bureau Inspector position was frozen in prior fiscal years and remains frozen in the
adopted budget. The annual cost of salary and benefits to restore the position is $104,024. This position is
recommended for restoration to augment services provided from the current level.

TOTAL COST

$104,024

Fully Restore Funding to Cultural and Recreational Organizations
The City provides funding above what is legally required to a number of cultural and recreational organizations. The
adopted budget reduces funding beyond the required minimum by approximately 10% to the Chabot Space and
Science Center, Oakland Zoo, and others. Restoring this 10% reduction would total approximately $100,000.

TOTAL COST

$100,000

Unfreeze or Restore Department Director or Other Administrative Positions
The adopted budget includes freezing or eliminating a number of managerial and general administrative positions,
including freezing the Administrative Services Director ($230,000), freezing the Community Services Director
($230,000), and eliminating the Executive Assistant to the Administrative Services Director ($112,000). Unfreezing
and filling the director positions would result in improved performance of these functions including increased
efficiency and effectiveness and, more importantly, increased capacity of our existing staff. This would also put in
place the organizational structure which the City Council, on two occasions has approved and provided the associated
funding.

TOTAL COST

$572,000

Unfreeze or Restore Finance and Technology Positions
The adopted budget includes freezing or eliminating a number of General Purpose Fund positions that are vacant, e.g.,
finance positions, and one technology position. Within Treasury, a vacant manager position overseeing retirement
functions was eliminated at a savings of approximately $200,000. This workload will be distributed among busy
existing staff and its restoration would greatly assist capacity within this critical function. Two vacant Account Clerk
II positions were frozen in the Police Department at a savings of approximately $150,000, which will result in delays

A-1

POLICY TRADEOFFS & SERVICE BUYBACKS
in billing and collections. A vacant accounting supervisor position in the Controller’s Office was also frozen saving
approximately $150,000, which will require distributing this workload among busy existing staff. A vacant
Management Intern position in the City Administrator’s Budget Office was eliminated at a savings of approximately
$15,000. Finally, a vacant Telecommunications System Engineer position was eliminated for a savings of
approximately $140,000, one of the only reductions in that function. Internal service departments have been severely
cut over past years and any restoration of these positions would greatly assist with managing workload, preserve
service levels help mitigate capacity issues.

TOTAL COST

$655,000

POLICY TRADEOFFS--FUNDING OF PRIORITY SERVICES
Similar to restoring some of the expenditure cuts in the FY 2013-15 Adopted Policy Budget discussed above, the City
Council might wish to consider expanding funding for certain key services beyond the levels included in the adopted
budget. Since there are no revenues associated with these proposals, they are policy tradeoffs for the City Council to
consider against the policies funded in the Adopted Policy Budget. Some prominent service areas for consideration
include the following:

1.

Additional Police Sworn Staffing

2.

Additional Police Civilian Staff

3.

Maintenance of Former Redevelopment Parcels

4.

City Attorney Positions

5.

Repair and Replacement of City Facilities

6.

Additional City Vehicles

Additional Information Technology

1) Additional Police Sworn Staffing

The adopted budget includes two graduating academies per FY, with the funding for one police academy in FY
2013-14 (168th) and two in FY 2014-15 (169th and 170th). The cost to add a fourth academy to the two-year
period would require additional expenditures of approximately $4M for the academy itself and $8M in ongoing funding for the officers per year (depending on the timing). Alternatively, the cost of if a lateral
academy to add 20 new officers would be approximately $2.5M for pre-academy and some Oakland-specific
academy training, as well as approximately $4M on-going funding (not including cost escalation) for the
officers per year.

TOTAL COST

2) Additional Police Civilian Staffing

$TBD/Various Scenarios

As part of the proposed budget, the OPD reported that it needs approximately 56 FTE civilian positions to
support critical operating needs to fully utilize the effectiveness and efficiency of our sworn officers and
OPD’s service delivery models. The adopted budget restored 14 of the 56 FTE civilian positions, bringing the
need to 42 positions. It should be noted that the adopted budget also restored 1 FTE for CODIS
Investigators/Criminalists II for Crime Lab and an additional 2 FTE for Police Service Technicians II.

3) Maintenance of Former Redevelopment Parcels
When the former Oakland Redevelopment Agency was dissolved, it transferred a number of vacant parcels to
the City. No funding was transferred from the Agency to the City for the ongoing maintenance of the sites,
which need continual weed, litter, and graffiti abatement, fencing and lighting maintenance, etc.; nor can
these costs be recovered as recognizable obligations of the Agency. The cost for this ongoing maintenance,
estimated at approximately $516,464 annually, is not included in the adopted budget. Note that the City’s
responsibilities and costs associated with these properties might change depending on State action. In
addition, the City will create a comprehensive asset management plan that might impact the City’s ownership
and maintenance of these properties.

TOTAL COST

$516,464

City Attorney Positions
The adopted budget funds three new attorney positions in the City Attorney’s Office. The intention is to have
the City conduct more work in house rather than contracting the work out to private law firms that likely
have higher costs. The argument is that using private law firms restricts flexibility, capacity, and is a more
costly method of obtaining legal services. The City Attorney’s Office has requested an additional eight
positions for similar purposes, at a cost of approximately $1,361,972.

Additional Repair and Replacement of City Facilities
The Capital Improvement Program identifies specific funding for a limited number of facility and
infrastructure projects as well as some critical projects that are deferred for lack of funding. The adopted
budget includes an investment of $2.0M annually for critical City facility repairs. The City Council might wish
to consider investment in repair and replacement to reduce the total lifecycle cost of ownership of facilities
and infrastructure, such as City buildings and roads.

Additional City Vehicles
The City is in the process of purchasing the replacement of a number of vehicles and other equipment
recently approved by City Council. Although this is a step in the right direction as the City has deferred these
expenditures in the recent past, it should be noted that subsequent to this purchase the City’s fleet will still
have a number of vehicles overdue for replacement, as reported in Public Works’ recent Infrastructure
Report: Vehicle and Equipment Fleet. The City Council might wish to consider investment in new vehicles and
equipment to reduce the total lifecycle cost of ownership of these items.

Additional Information Technology
Although the adopted budget funds a number of critical information technology systems and necessary ongoing ITD operating costs to begin to address many years of under investment, the updated Capital

unfunded and that will require investment in the very near term.

BUDGET GUIDE
Budget Overview
At its core, a local government budget is officially approved revenue and spending plan that authorizes a municipality
to use public dollars to provide services. Local governments use their budgets for a variety of additional purposes,
including communication, planning, accountability, and evaluation.
The City of Oakland has a two fiscal-year (biennial) budget cycle. For the City of Oakland, the fiscal year
begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. The current budget has been adopted for fiscal years (FY) 201314 and 20014-15. This same fiscal year calendar is used by the State of California, and most cities,
counties, and school districts. The City policy of adopting a two-year budget is intended to improve the
City’s long-term planning, enhance funding stability, and to create greater efficiency in the budget
development process. While the City’s budget is adopted for a 24-month period, appropriations are
divided into two one-year spending plans. During the second year of the two-year cycle, the Mayor and
Council conduct a mid-cycle budget review to address variances in estimated revenues, estimated
expenditures, and other changes to the City’s financial condition.
The City of Oakland’s budget presents two principal types of data: projected revenues and planned expenditures.
Expenditures can be divided by type (e.g. salaries, retirement contributions, debt service, supplies, capital projects,
etc.), and by the department that spends them (e.g. Police, Fire, Library, Public Works, etc.). Revenues are monetary
resources that the City anticipates will become available during the fiscal year. City revenues can be categorized by
type (e.g. property tax, sales tax, permit fees, etc.). City revenues may also be divided into those that can be expended
on general or restricted purposes. For instance, the City’ Measure Q parcel tax revenues can only be used for libraries,
whereas the City’s business tax revenues can be used for all governmental purposes.
To ensure that restricted revenues are used only for appropriate expenditures, the City accounts for its financial
resources in different “funds.” For instance, grants from the federal Department of Transportation for road
construction are held in a different fund than are revenues from the City’s Wildfire Prevention Assessment District.
The largest City fund is the General Purpose Fund which can be used for all public purposes over which the City has
jurisdiction. General Purpose Fund revenues are generally unrestricted and include most taxes. The budget document
will present data related to the General Purpose Fund only and to “all funds” (including the General Purpose Fund).

The Budget Process
The budget process is the procedure through which the City formally develops, deliberates and adopts its budget.
Through the budget the City Council approves revenue estimates and authorizes expenditures. A budget is a reflection
of a city’s priorities and policies. The budget process consists of several important stages: 1) Budget Development, 2)
Budget Adoption, and 3) Budget Amendment.

Budget Development
Oct 2012:
Five Year Forecast Report

Nov-Dec 2012:
Baseline Budget Development

Planning for the FY 2013-15 Budget began with the production and publication
of the City’s Five-Year Financial Forecast in fall 2012, a planning level estimate of
revenues and expenditures that surfaces all major budget issues and
contextualizes the long-term financial environment.
In fall 2012, the Controller’s Office created a “baseline budget,” which is a draft
two-year budget that estimates revenues and expenditures if the City maintains
its current staffing, programs, and policies. The baseline budget is the foundation
upon which the proposed budget is developed. The Controller’s Office worked in
conjunction with departments to create the baseline budget, taking into account
the latest economic projections and information on likely expenditures increases,

BUDGET GUIDE
such as fringe benefit rates for retirement and health care. The comparison of
expected revenues and expenditures in the baseline budget is what defines
whether the City will have a surplus or shortfall to address in the proposed
budget.
Jan-Mar 2013:
Internal Analysis

Mar -Apr 2013:
Proposed Budget Finalized

After the development of the baseline budget, the City Administrator’s Office
directs, through “budget instructions,” the departments to submit requests for
changes to the baseline budget. Departmental requests can include changes such
as new programs, increased appropriations, reduced expenditures,
reorganizations, or shifting appropriations from one program or service to
another. The Controller’s Office conducts in-depth analysis of each budget
request to assess the value and confirm the fiscal feasibility. Based on the
analysis, the Controller’s Office provides recommendations to the City
Administrator. The City Administrator and key staff hold internal budget
hearings with department directors and their staff to discuss proposals. The City
Administrator makes preliminary budget decisions based on the internal
hearings, additional analysis, and the Mayor’s priorities.
The City Administrator provides a preliminary budget proposal to the Mayor.
The Mayor weighs options, conducts additional analysis, considers Council,
community, and other stakeholder input, and issues a final Proposed Policy
Budget in April.

Budget Adoption
Apr-May 2013:
Community Input

May-June 2013:
Council Deliberations
June 2013:
Council Budget Adoption

City Council members hold community meetings to obtain input from
constituents on FY 2013-15 budget priorities and to understand questions and
concerns pertaining to the Administration’s proposed budget.
Upon presentation of the proposed budget, the Mayor and City Council conduct a
series of public hearings to review the FY 2013-15 proposed budget.
As required by the City Charter, the City Council will adopt a balanced budget by
June 30, preceding the start of the fiscal year commencing July 1. The adopted
budget provides two-year appropriation authority for all funds, and first- and
second-year appropriations for the Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The CIP
appropriations are outlined in two annual spending plans for FY 2013-15.

Budget Amendment
Apr-June 2014:
Midcycle Budget Amendment

B-2

Toward the end of the first year of the two-year cycle, the Mayor and Council
conduct a mid-cycle budget review to address variances in estimated revenues,
estimated expenditures, and other changes to the City’s financial condition. For
the FY 2013-15 budget cycle, the mid-cycle review will take place in March-June
2014, and will pertain to revenues and expenditures for FY 2014-15 (i.e. the
second year of the biennial budget).

BUDGET GUIDE
Year-Round
Budget Amendments

The Council can make amendments to the budget throughout the two-year
period. Appropriation of new money, or changes to the allocation of
appropriations between funds or departments require Council approval.
Transfers between divisions within a department, between spending accounts,
or between projects may be made at the administrative level. These transfers can
be authorized by the City Administrator, Controller’s Office, or department
directors, depending on the nature of the transfer.

CITY FACTS
GENERAL INFORMATION
The City of Oakland (“City”) is located on the east side of the San Francisco Bay in the County of Alameda. Oakland is
bordered by 19 miles of coastline to the west and rolling hills to the east, which provide unparalleled vistas of the Bay
and the Pacific Ocean. In between are traditional, well-kept neighborhoods, a progressive downtown, and superior
cultural and recreational amenities. Oakland serves as the administrative hub of the County of Alameda, the regional
seat for the federal government, the district location of primary state offices, and the center of commerce and
international trade for the Bay Area.
Oakland is the eighth largest city in the State of California, with an estimated population of 399,326, and a wealth of
resources and opportunities. It is home to the Port of Oakland, which is the fifth busiest maritime port in the U.S. and
among the top 25 in the world. Oakland International Airport has undergone a $300 million Terminal Improvement
program including construction of a new concourse with seven boarding gates/waiting areas, centralized
food/beverage and retail shopping areas, as well as expanded ticketing, security, and baggage claim facilities.
Three major projects are either underway, funded or in planning. The former Oakland Army Base broke ground on
Oakland Global, a revitalization and redevelopment project that will further enhance the Port of Oakland’s
competiveness. The Brooklyn Basin project – the largest approved, mixed use masterplan in the city – is receiving $1.5
billion in funding from a developer and investor from China that will transform 65 acres of waterfront property along
the Oakland Estuary with 3,100 residential units and approximately 200,000 square feet of retail and commercial
space. In October 2013, the City began negotiations with a major investment partner for the Coliseum City project -the largest transit-oriented development project in California -- which will transform an entire area of Oakland,
creating thousands of new jobs and a regional destination.
In concert with ongoing economic development efforts, the City strives to maintain a balance between old and new.
Historic structures continue to be preserved and revitalized while new buildings are constructed. The City has
completed its part in a $350 million revitalization effort to create a multifaceted government center that links major
historical landmarks with new developments. Major corporate headquarters include Clorox and Kaiser Permanente,
which are in close proximity to many new businesses and various small retail shops that have sprung up in the
downtown area.
Oakland is a mature city that has been able to preserve its abundant natural beauty and resources. The City has over
100 parks (totaling over 2,500 acres) within its borders, as well as several recreational areas along its perimeter. Lake
Merritt, the largest saltwater lake within a U.S. city, borders the downtown area. Its shoreline is a favorite retreat for
joggers, office workers and picnickers. At dusk, the area sparkles as the Lake is lit with the “Necklace of Lights.” Lake
Merritt is the oldest officially declared wildlife sanctuary in the United States, dating back to 1870.

CITY FACTS
CITY GOVERNMENT
The City of Oakland has a Mayor-Council form of government. The Mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term, and
can be re-elected only once. The Mayor is not a member of the City Council; however, he or she has the right to vote as
one if the Council members are evenly divided.
The City Council is the legislative body of the City and is comprised of eight Council members. One Council member is
elected “at large,” while the other seven Council members represent specific districts. All Council members are elected
to serve four-year terms. Each year the Council members elect one member as President of the Council and one
member to serve as Vice Mayor.
The City Administrator is appointed by the Mayor and is subject to confirmation by the City Council. The City
Administrator is responsible for the day-to-day administrative and fiscal operations of the City.

OAKLAND’S ECONOMIC BASE
Oakland has diversified its economic base significantly in the past few decades. The economy offers a healthy mix of
trade, government, financial, medical, information technology, publishing and service-oriented occupations.
Industries with the largest growth in jobs in the last two years are professional and business services, education and
healthcare, leisure and hospitality, and traditional and specialty food production.
Oakland offers abundant resources to its businesses and residents: state-of-the-art transportation, a vibrant dining
and entertainment scene, and utility facilities keep the City running smoothly. Several new office and mixed-use
buildings, public facilities, hotels, convention facilities, park enhancements and outdoor art have created a
cosmopolitan environment in the downtown area. Waterfront restaurants and shops at Jack London Square, as well as
the burgeoning Old Oakland and Uptown districts provide lively nighttime attractions. The City’s neighborhood retail
areas continue to grow, as evidenced by Oakland’s nine Business Improvement Districts. While manufacturing
remains an important segment of the City’s economy, some industrial land has been converted to residential and
work/live use.
A variety of incentives are available to companies located in the City’s Foreign Trade, and Recycling Market
Development Zones. The Economic Development staff links businesses with the many services available to them
throughout the area and serves as an ombudsman for companies dealing with the City. Neighborhood Commercial
Specialists work with merchants in each commercial district to promote the district, obtain loans, expedite permits
and arrange for City services.
Oakland plays a pivotal role in the East Bay Trade Area; it is a city of rich history, impressive growth and a promising
future. Located within one of the nation’s largest metropolitan areas, California’s eighth most populous city is the
economic heart of the East Bay. Oakland has the infrastructure and economic base to support and attract a diverse mix
of advanced industries and value-oriented retail.
Downtown Oakland offers competitive office space, a fiber-optic infrastructure and the amenities for both traditional
and emerging enterprises. The well-maintained freeways, the mass transit systems and the ferry service make getting
to and from downtown Oakland a relatively quick and easy process—travel times to San Francisco, San Jose and other
Bay Area cities are surprisingly short.
The Oakland Metropolitan Area (Alameda and Contra-Costa counties) is one of the highest spending markets in the
nation, with a mean household income of $95,495. In the City of Oakland itself, some 156,790 households earn, on
average, $73,975 per year, resulting in over $3.0 billion in annual taxable sales.
City departments take a proactive approach and use streamlined processes to best serve the needs of the business
community.

Ohlone Indians settle in the area that would become Oakland.

1772

Spanish explorers are the first Europeans to visit the East Bay.

1797

Established in Fremont, Mission de San José extends Spanish jurisdiction over the area that
would become Oakland.

1849

During the California Gold Rush, Oakland becomes the mainland staging point for passengers and
cargo traveling between the Bay and the Sierra foothills.

1852

Oakland was chartered as a city and almost immediately thereafter, construction of shipping
wharves began. Building the large wharves and dredging a shipping channel positioned Oakland
as an independent point of destination.

1869

The Central Pacific Railroad selected Oakland as the terminus of the new transcontinental
railroad, providing a vital link to the East.

1910

Oakland’s population more than doubles in ten years from 66,960 to over 150,000 as people and
businesses relocate from earthquake-ravaged San Francisco. Oakland regains control of the longlost waterfront by final settlement of litigation, which had lasted over half a century and cost
several millions of dollars.

1936

The Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge, one of the engineering wonders of the world, opens
months before the Golden Gate Bridge.

1942

The Permanente Foundation Hospital is dedicated in Oakland, the first in the chain of Henry J.
Kaiser’s health plan hospitals.

1950

Children’s Fairyland opens in Lakeside Park. Swelled by huge numbers of workers who flocked
to the city for WWII jobs, the U.S. Census puts Oakland’s population at 384,575. Oakland’s African
American population soars from 8,462 in 1940 to 47,562 in 1950. The military makes substantial
improvement to the Port’s facilities.
World War II brought tremendous changes to Oakland. Huge numbers of workers moved to the
Bay Area to work in local shipyards, and many of these people, as well as large numbers of
military personnel who mustered out at Treasure Island and the Oakland Army Base, chose to
remain in the Bay Area. As a result, the City’s population increased by nearly one third between
1940 and 1950.

Late 1950s – 1970s Under the Urban Indian Relocation Program, Oakland saw large numbers of Native Americans
move to the city.
1970s

Following the end of the Vietnam War, Oakland welcomed Cambodians, Vietnamese and Muong
from war-torn Southeast Asia.

2010

390,724. According to a University of Wisconsin study, Oakland is the most ethnically diverse
city in the United States. There are at least 100 different languages and dialects spoken here.
A new generation of restaurateurs and specialty food producers has fueled an epicurean
renaissance. Oakland’s sizzling arts and dining scene is no longer a local secret as national media
outlets spread the word on our vibrant city.
Oakland has a rich literary and cultural heritage. Such historical notables as writers Bret Harte,
Jack London, Joaquin Miller, Ina Donna Coolbrith, Jessica Mitford, Narman Jayo, Ishmael Reed
and Gertrude Stein; architect Julia Morgan; and dancer Isadora Duncan are just a few who have
left their cultural mark on the City. It is also the birthplace of the West Coast Blues.

Many of its animals are kept in relatively “natural” habitats, and expanded natural habitats are planned. The Zoo is
nationally known for its excellent elephant exhibit and has been praised for allowing its elephants to roam freely.
Paramount Theater -This beautiful Art Deco theater opened in 1931 and was authentically restored in 1973. The
theater hosts an impressive variety of popular attractions, including the Oakland East Bay Symphony, Broadway
shows, R&B concerts, gospel performers, comedy, and special engagements.
Oakland’s Western Aerospace Museum - Located at the Airport’s North Field, showcases aviation history through
special exhibits, multimedia presentations, hands-on displays incorporating 13 vintage airplanes, photographs,
replicas and other artifacts, and classes for students of all ages.
Malonga Casquelourd Center for the Arts - This restored 1920s building is a popular multicultural,
multidisciplinary performing-arts complex sponsored by the city. The 400-seat theater and five rehearsal and class
spaces showcase drama, ballet, and African and contemporary dance. Several long-standing arts organizations-Axis
Dance Company, Bay Area Blues Society, CitiCentre Dance Theater, Dimensions Dance Theater, and Oakland Youth
Orchestra-call the center home.
The Crucible – Located in West Oakland, this non-profit educational facility fosters a collaboration of Arts, Industry
and Community. Through training in the fine and industrial arts, The Crucible promotes creative expression, reuse of
materials and innovative design while serving as an accessible arts venue for the general public.
Professional/Amateur Sports - Oakland is a magnet for sports fans of all types. Whatever the season, Oakland pro
and amateur games frequently garner large crowds and broad national media coverage. In the last three decades,
Oakland’s professional sports teams have won six world championships in three major sports.


Golden State Warriors – The Warriors continue to showcase exciting basket-ball. The most recent season
was a season of change with new ownership, coaching and players. The Warriors were one of only seven
teams to improve their record from the prior year, making the prospects for a playoff berth highly anticipated
for the coming seasons.



Oakland Athletics – The Oakland Athletics have won six American League Championships and four baseball
World Series titles.



Oakland Raiders – From dominance in three Super Bowl victories to improbable come-from-behind
victories, the Raiders have been involved in some of professional football's most incredible moments.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
INTRODUCTION TO FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
This section contains tables summarizing revenue and expenditure data for the entire City. Summaries are presented
by fund. Tables are also presented on fund balances and fund descriptions.

CITY REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE FORECAST METHODOLOGY
The City prepares revenue and expenditure forecasts for its biennial budget. The forecasts are based on department
input, historical budgetary performance, and prevailing general economic conditions. A detailed forecast is prepared
for the General Purpose Fund (GPF), and for other funds.
To prepare the forecast, a comprehensive analysis of the components of the City's revenues and expenditures is
performed. These major components are projected into the two-to-five-year period on the basis of various relevant
assumptions. For example, projections for property tax, the single largest source of revenues for the City's General
Purpose Fund (GPF), are done based on the county database plus the projected growth/decline in the net assessed
value of locally assessed property as well as the projected changes to the tax delinquency rate. Similarly, forecast of
the expenditures is performed by separately analyzing individual expenditure categories (e.g. salaries, retirement,
benefits, utility expenses) based on forecast cost increases (e.g. pay-step increases, PERS retirement rates, benefit cost
inflation, energy prices).

Forecasting Techniques
Citywide revenues and expenditures are projected using two forecasting techniques: qualitative analysis, and
quantitative analysis. Each of these two techniques has strengths and weaknesses. Qualitative analysis includes
narratives and account for variables that may not be quantifiable or consistent with the statistical trend. Quantitative
technique provides time series trends that may or may not account for narratives to explain volatile numbers from
year to year. These two analyses are not mutually exclusive; instead, they are complementary to each other to ensure
the greatest possible, reasonable accuracy.
Qualitative analysis projects future revenues and/or expenditures using non-statistical techniques. These techniques
rely on professional/human judgment rather than statistical analysis to arrive at revenue projections. Qualitative
forecasting is essential for projecting revenue or expenditure components that are unstable, volatile, or for which
there is limited historical information. To facilitate sound qualitative analysis, the City of Oakland seeks input from
outside experts in economic forecasting, municipal finance, and other relevant fields. Just two examples of this is the
City’s reliance on the League of Cities’ analysis and recommendations relating to legislative issues impacting cities,
and the Legislative Analyst Office for their expertise and analysis of the State of California budgetary issues that may
potentially affect the City of Oakland.
Quantitative analysis involves looking at data to understand historical trends and causal relationships. One kind of
quantitative analysis is time series analysis; it is based on data which have been collected over time and can be shown
chronologically on graphs. When using time series techniques, the forecaster is especially interested in the nature of
seasonal fluctuations which occur within a year, the nature of multiyear cycles, and the nature of any possible longrun trends. Causal analysis is another type of quantitative analysis; it deals with the historical interrelationships
between two or more variables. One or more predictors influence, directly or indirectly, the future revenue or
expenditure. The causal forecasting techniques are predicated upon selecting the correct independent variables,
correctly defining their interrelationship to the dependent variable, i.e. the projected revenue or expenditure item,
and, finally, collecting accurate data.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Revenue Forecast
Citywide revenues are projected using dynamic forecasting which anticipates changes in revenues triggered by new
economic development, economic growth, changes in the levels of service of departments (as approved in the case of
Master Fee Schedule changes by the City Council), changes in governmental policies at the state or federal level, and
various economic and demographic changes. The purpose of this dynamic forecast is to demonstrate the potential
impact of various events and actions on the selected revenue sources. Under this scenario:


Tax Revenues are projected to grow at rates that are responsive to dynamic forces in the economy. Generally,
the assumption is the local economy will be affected by national and state trends, with some deviation
expected due to specific characteristics of regional business and labor markets.



Fee increases will likely follow the projected inflation and changes in the local population due to increased
service costs and changes in demand.



Any known or anticipated changes in revenues as a result of potential changes in state revenue streams
and/or legislation are reflected in the analysis.

The revenue forecast takes into consideration a number of economic factors and trends, including changes in economic
growth, income, sales and Consumer Price Index (CPI), among other factors. Additionally, anticipated changes in State
or local policy are also considered.

Expenditure Forecast
Forecasting the City's expenditures involves analyzing, at the department level, and by category.
The expenditure forecast begins with the (1) baseline budget, which represents the cost of maintaining the current
level of services, while taking into account all unavoidable costs necessary to continue at that current level. Examples
of unavoidable costs are pre-negotiated MOU salary levels, as well as health care and retirement costs that the City
pays on behalf of its employees.
The baseline budget is then modified to reflect (2) changes to programs and services that the Mayor and the City
Administrator decide to include as part of the Proposed Budget and (3) mandated changes arising from Federal, State
or Court actions or expiration of outside agency funding. These modifications could include additions or subtractions
in any of categories (1) through (3) above. Changes to debt service are less discretionary, and are made based on
changes in the Treasury Division's debt payment schedules.
The expenditure forecast follows the guidance of the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), which
recommends that expenditures be grouped into units of analysis that are meaningful to the organization, such as
departments and standard budget categories of expenditures. As such, staff grouped baseline (FY 2013-15) proposed
budget expenditures by department and by expenditure category, consistent with the City’s chart of accounts. Future
expenditures were forecasted from the FY 2013-15 proposed budget. This forecast generally assumes that
expenditures will only grow due to inflationary cost escalation. Though In a small number of cases, costs are also
expected to change due to new operating expenditures, which are changes in service or staffing levels, as described
below.

•

The Police Department will run two police academies per year in FY 2015-16, FY 2016-17, and FY 2017-18 to
roughly maintain the number of sworn staff achieved by the FY 2013-15 budget proposal, 707;
The City will lose Successor Agency project staff as their projects and funding wind down;
Note that this forecast assumes the same funding level when Measure Y expires on December 31, 2014 when the
Wildfire Prevention Assessment District expires on June 30, 2014 will not be renewed. The parking revenue for
Measure Y will not be collected by January 1, 2015 if the Measure is not renewed while the parcel tax covers until
June 30, 2015;
The City will appropriate $10M in FY 2015-16 and an additional $10M in FY 2016-17 to a reserve for unfunded
pension and OPEB liabilities, as directed by City Council.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
BASIS OF BUDGETING
The City of Oakland’s basis of budgeting for its major fund groups (General Funds, Special Revenue Funds, Enterprise
Funds, Internal Service Funds and Capital Project Funds) are the Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (GAAP),
and the modified accrual basis of accounting.
Revenues are budgeted according to when they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be
available when they are collected within the current year, or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current
period. The City considers property tax revenues to be available for the year levied if they are collected within 60
days of the end of the current fiscal year. All other revenues are considered to be available if they are collected within
120 days of the end of the current fiscal year.
Expenditures are budgeted according to when the liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.
The exceptions are debt service, compensated absences, claims and judgments, which are budgeted as expenditures
according to when the payments are due.
The City’s basis of budgeting is the same as the basis of accounting used in the City’s audited financial statement, the
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).

PLANNING FOR THE CITY OF OAKLAND’S TWO-YEAR BUDGET
Planning for the Two-Year Budget
The City’s budget development process begins over a year in advance of the actual adoption of the two-year budget.
During this advance planning process, the City identifies factors (known or anticipated) that may have a significant
effect on future revenues, expenditures, or staffing levels. The analysis is based on actual City revenue and
expenditure trends, general and relevant economic trends and outlooks, input from the City Departments who
oversee those specific expenditure and revenue streams, and input from outside economists and revenue experts.
Staff’s budget forecast was presented to the City Council at a budget workshop (held for the FY 2013-15 Budget on
April 2nd 2013). At the workshop, the Council was provided with information regarding the City’s financial situation,
including the five-year financial forecast and FY 2012-13 third quarter Revenue& Expenditure report.

SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL PURPOSE FUND REVENUES
Below is a detailed discussion of the individual categories that comprise General Purpose Fund (GPF) revenues. For
each category, a brief description is provided, followed by historical data, relevant analysis, key forecast assumptions
and then the forecast itself.

Property Tax
Property tax is the largest single source of revenue for the GPF. The property tax is ad valorem, which means that the
tax paid on a property is proportional to the property’s value. However, Proposition 13, which passed in 1978,
introduced two significant caveats: 1) the annual tax owed is a maximum of 1 percent of a property’s assessed value,
and 2) the assessed value can only increase a maximum 2 percent each year, unless ownership changes, in which case
the prevailing market value assessment is used as the basis for taxation.
The one percent assessment is collected by the County and is distributed to various public entities in accordance with
a complex formula. The County’s computation results in the City receiving about 26 percent of total collections.

Over the last 10 years, property tax revenue has grown on average, year-over-year, at a steady pace of 9.8 percent,
due primarily to robust increases in local housing values. The growth for that period was accelerated by a rapid runup of housing demand, new construction, and developments that began in FY 2004-05. The rise in FY 2004-05
property tax revenues was also due to a Vehicle License Fee (VLF) “backfill” payment from the State (the difference
between the old VLF of 2.0% and new fee of 0.65%) in the form of property tax. The value of rising property tax,
which increased more quickly than VLF revenues, brought Oakland additional revenues.
Beginning in FY 2004-05, property assessments rose quickly, propelled by high volume of home sales and rising home
prices. Driven by economic growth and aggressive lending practices, the housing market accelerated and finally
peaked in 2007. After this peak, housing demand and prices eventually declined due to an economic downturn, lack of
affordability, tightened credit, and increased foreclosures. The resulting decrease in home sales volume for new and
existing homes drove down home prices, which in turn continues to slow Property Tax revenue growth.
Taking into consideration the uncertainties brought on by the continuing sluggishness of the housing market, home
foreclosures, tightened lending policies, the assumption is that the growth rate for Property Tax revenue will be below
the historical trend for the forecast period. The budget assumes a 2% percent increase in FY 2013-14 and in FY 201415 consistent with initial assessments from Alameda County’s Assessor of growth in assessed value.

Sales & Use Tax
Sales and Use Tax applies to the retail sale or use of “tangible personal property.” The recent passage of Proposition
30 brings the total Sales Tax percentage in the City of Oakland to 9.0 percent; meaning on a $1 purchase tax paid is 9
cents. The City receives 1% percent of the total tax, meaning the City receives 1 cent on a $1 purchase.
The table below details the general allocation of Sales and Use Tax on purchases in the City of Oakland. Some of the tax
revenue receive by the State of California is redistributed to counties to provide health and public safety services.

Sales Tax revenue is fairly volatile, varying to a large extent with the overall strength of the local and national
economy. During the previous recession, Sales tax revenue declined significantly. Recently, Sales Tax revenues have
increased due to the economic recovery. Increases are also attributable to high gasoline and jet fuel prices.
One of the strengths of the Oakland Sales Tax base is its diversity; it comes from seven major business groups. No
single group accounts for more than 25 percent of the total. See the chart below.

Sales Tax revenue in FY 2013-14 is projected to be 9.3% higher than its FY 2011-12 level, due to the economic
recovery. In the second year of the two-year budget sales tax revenue is expected to increase by roughly 3% annually.

Business License Tax
The Business License Tax (BLT) is charged annually to Oakland businesses based either gross receipts (60 percent) or
rental income (40 percent). The rate on gross receipts varies by type of business, ranging from a low of sixty cents per
$1,000 of receipts for grocers to six dollars per $1,000 of receipts for public utilities. The rate on rental income is
$13.95 per $1,000.
Business License Tax has been a relatively steady and reliable revenue source as shown in the chart below. However,
BLT is impacted by the condition of the economy. Recessions slow down business activity, which in turn slows down
the number of businesses paying business license taxes and their gross receipts. From FY 2009-10 through FY 201112 the City has performed a number of special audit projects which have helped to stabilize revenues bringing
businesses into compliance and collecting interest and penalties on previously unpaid taxes.
Recovery of the local economy and the implementation of a new business discovery program are expected to help
increase revenues in future years. Over the two-year budget, business license tax revenue is expected to increase by
roughly 3% annually.

Utility Consumption Tax
The Utility Consumption Tax (UCT) is imposed on the use of utilities, primarily electricity, natural gas, cable television,
and telephone. The UCT applies to both residential and commercial users. It is collected by utility companies and
remitted to the City each month. The tax rate in Oakland has been 7.5 percent since 1993, although there are two
significant exceptions: annual payments by manufacturers are capped at $350,000, and low-income residents pay just
5.5 percent on energy use (gas and electricity).
The FY 2012-13 UCT revenue totaled $50.75 million and its composition is shown below. The graph illustrates that in
FY 2012-13, energy and telecommunications accounted for a major portion of UCT, at 55 percent and 36 percent,
respectively. Cable television accounted for the remaining 9 percent.

UCT Revenues in FY 2012-13
Telecom
36%

Energy
55%

Cable TV
9%

Historical growth in UCT revenue has been due in large part to increases in the tax rate and the prices of energy and
services billed to customers. This tax is unpredictable due to industry restructuring, technological change, weather,
energy market dynamics, price volatility, consumption patterns and energy conservation.
Energy consumption has been negatively impacted by the recession, energy efficiency programs, and by local
conservation efforts. Telecommunications accounts for 36% of UCT revenues down from 40% in FY 2009-10. This is
due to innovations in technology that have begun to erode the tax base. Services like pre-paid cell phones and voice
over internet protocol, combined with decreasing data costs and industry price wars, are placing downward pressure
on the consumption of taxable telecommunications services.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Real Estate Transfer Tax (RETT)
The RETT rate is 1.61 percent charged to real estate transactions. Oakland’s share is 1.5 percent - Alameda County
gets the remaining .11 percent. The tax is triggered by the transfer of property ownership and both the buyer and
seller are responsible for ensuring the tax is paid.
Up until 2006, RETT revenue had been one of the fastest growing major revenue categories, following significant real
estate market growth. As the real estate market cooled in 2007, sales volume significantly declined, and home prices
decreased. This resulted from the economic downturn, rising new and existing home inventories, and escalating home
foreclosures due to falling home prices and growing number of adjustable rate mortgages and subprime loan defaults.
Additionally, new and more stringent lending standards plus reluctance on the part of lenders applied further
downward pressure on the housing market. As demand for housing and sales transactions plummeted, RETT revenue
took a major hit. In FY 2012-13 the local housing market began to experience a substantial recovery in the average
sale price of homes. These price increases have resulted in strong increases in RETT revenues. It should be noted that
the volume of home sales has lagged price increased largely due to many homeowners being underwater (owing a
mortgage larger than the value of their home) and continued weakness in the national housing market.
RETT is often subject to major non-recurring revenues. When certain high value properties are sold they can result in
anomalously high revenue. In past years the sale of the downtown City Center complex resulted in nearly $10 million
in revenue. These very large transactions cannot be accurately predicted.
Over the two-year budget RETT revenue is expected to increase by roughly 4% annually.

D - 75

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT)
The Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) rate is 14 percent and is paid by lodgers at the City’s hotels who stay thirty days
or less; the tax is collected and remitted by hotel operators. The rate was increased from 11 to 14 percent in FY 200809 due to the Measure C tax surcharge. Measure C supports various cultural institutions and is booked in a separate
fund.
TOT revenue declined by 17% in FY 2008-09 and FY 2009-10 due to the recession’s adverse affects on tourism and
travel. This is consistent with the prior recessions. Following the September 11 th terrorist attacks and economic
slowdown, TOT revenues declined sharply and remained flat for the next four years. In FY 2005-06, TOT rebounded
by 9.7 percent, and continued positive growth two years afterward, culminating in a near-record high of $12.2 million
in FY 2007-08. In FY 2008-09, TOT was again affected by an unprecedented economic recession.
TOT is expected to recover significantly over the two-year budget, reaching $12.6 million in FY 13-14 which is a 48%
increase over its recessionary low. TOT is exceed to equal its pre-recession high of $2.2 million in FY 2013-14. The
recovery in TOT revenues has been principally driven by high average daily hotel room rates rather than by increased
numbers of occupied hotel rooms.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Parking Tax
The Parking Tax is a tax imposed on the occupant of an off-street parking space. The tax rate is 18.5 percent (8.5
percent supports Measure Y activities and is booked in a separate fund), and is collected by parking operators.
Approximately half of the City’s Parking Tax revenue is generated from parking at the Oakland International Airport.
The Parking Tax revenues are strongly correlated with passenger volume at the Oakland International Airport.
Parking, revenue declined sharply in FY 2008-09, due to aggressive price competition, the economic downturn, and
reduced airline travel.
Parking Tax revenue is expected to regain levels reached during its pre-recession peak during the FY 2013-14 and FY
2014-15 budgets.

D - 77

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Licenses & Permits
Licenses and Permits revenue primarily includes special Police and Fire permits, traffic, medical cannabis, bingo
permits, residential parking permits, and animal licenses.
In FY 2006-07, 93 percent of License & Permit revenue related to development and building code enforcement
activities were taken out of the General Purpose Fund (GPF) and moved to the new Development Services Fund
(2415). Those revenues were specifically associated with a variety of development and enforcement activities, such as
land use, permit, and inspection and abatement services. This separation was intended to allow clearer monitoring of
these revenues and their related expenditures, as required by state law.
As a result of the separation, Licenses and Permits revenue after FY 2006-07 dropped to a new baseline of only 7
percent of the previous amounts.
Licenses and Permits are assumed to growth by 3% over the two-year budget.

D - 78

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Fines & Penalties
Fines & Penalties consist primarily of parking enforcement fines (roughly 90 percent of the total), penalties, and
interest on late property tax payments.
Parking citation revenue collected for FY 2013-14 is projected to be roughly 7.5% below FY 2011-12 actuals. The
decline is primarily due to decreased parking citation issuance arising from the implementation of several parking
friendliness policies including the five-minute grace period and the park mobile pilot program. Between FY 2013-14
and FY 2014-15 parking citation revenue is expected to decline by 4.0% due to the continued implementation of
parking friendliness policies and changing parking patron behavior; offset by collections strategies such as the
implementation of a Car Boot Compliance program in partnership with other local governments.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Interest Income
This revenue category nets interest income from investments against the cost of advances made from the City’s
General Purpose Fund to other funds.
Interest income is volatile, fluctuating along with short-term interest rate movements. Interest income is estimated at
$0.8 million in each of FY 2013-14 and FY 2014-15. The amount reflects the interest income projected to be received
from pooled investments.

Service Charges
Service charges are imposed on the user of a service provided by the City. The charge, or fee, may recover all or part of
the cost of providing the service. In FY 2006-07, the composition of this revenue changed significantly, explaining the
steep drop in revenue that year. A major change in that year saw $11 million in revenues related to building and
construction being permanently moved into the Development Services Fund (2415).

Background information concerning the components of service charges is provided below:


Port Revenue consists of payments for general services, Fire, and other services the City provides to the Port.
The City invoices semi-annually, based on actual costs of services. Port revenue is expected to remain
constant over the two-year budget.



Franchise Fees apply to four utilities for the use of City rights of way: PG&E for gas and electric; Waste
Management of Alameda County for garbage collection; East Bay Municipal Utility District for water; and
Comcast for cable television. Franchise fee revenue is expected to remain constant over the two-year budget
and five-year planning horizon.



Parking Meter Revenue consists of charges for parking in metered street stalls. Parking revenue is expected
to grow between 1% and 2% annually over the two-year budget.



Other Service Charges is revenue from other fees charged including parks and recreation fees, public works
fees, fire inspection fees, and charges for personnel service to provide public safety at events. These revenues
are expected to grow by 2% annually over the two-year budget.



Rental Income is rental fees for the City’s facilities and lands, as well as concessions at various locations.
These revenues are expected to grow between 1% and 2% annually over the two-year budget.

Miscellaneous
The Miscellaneous category consists largely of one-time items that do not fit well into other categories, such as
billboard revenue agreements and land/property sales. The Miscellaneous category has experienced substantial
variation from year to year, due to its one-time and unpredictable nature. The peaks in FY 2002-03, FY 2003-04, FY
2006-07 and FY 2008-09 occurred as a result of a large number of land and facility sales in those years. The large peak
in FY 2011-12 is also a result of land sales. Notably the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center was budgeted for sale and
rental of city property and assets.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Interfund Transfers
Interfund Transfers are transfers into the GPF from other funds. They can be made for a variety of reasons and have
various objectives. These transfers are usually one time payments or scheduled payments for a limited time.
For example, the Sewer Service Fund (3100) has been making fund transfers into GPF to cover the cost of the office
space taken up by Sewer Service employees in the City Administration Complex.
In FY 2012-13 the GPF received only $2.9 million in Interfund Transfers; including $400,000 from the Multipurpose
Fund and $608,000, one from the Sewer Service Fund. In FYs 13-14 and 14-15 the GPF is not expected to receive
Interfund Transfer revenue. The Multipurpose Fund is unable to support a transfer due to an operating deficit and
negative fund balance, and the Sewer Service Fund’s transfer is being reclassified as a service charge.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL PURPOSE FUND EXPENDITURES
Below is a detailed discussion of the individual categories that comprise General Purpose Fund (GPF) expenditures.
For each category, a brief description is provided, followed by relevant analysis, and key forecast assumptions.

Salaries
The sunset of most civilian and sworn employee contributions is already built into the FY 2013-15 Adopted budget, as
almost all contributions in current contracts end during that period. The forecast assumes a $6.0 million cost of living
adjustment (COLA) for civilian employees over the budget period. It assumes no COLA increase for sworn staff during
the budget period.

D - 93

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Fringe Benefits
Civilian and sworn fringe benefit expenditures are comprised of many components, including health insurance,
workers’ compensation, dental and vision insurance, disability insurance, unemployment insurance, and others. Staff
assumed that health insurance costs per dollar of salary expenditure would grow by 6% per year during between the
1st and 2nd budget year. Although the City’s health insurance program administrator, California Public Employees
Retirement System (CalPERS), will not provide a long-term estimate, this is consistent with a blend of recent history
and estimates by experts, notably the City’s actuary, Aon Hewitt, and the City’s health benefits broker. Other fringe
benefit expenditures are also projected to growth by an average of 6% per year. Cost sharing between employer and
employee on fringe benefits is also a bargained arrangement. For the purpose of the forecast, staff assumed that the
arrangement currently in place would continue (e.g., the City fully pays the Kaiser family of four health insurance
premium).

D - 94

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Retirement
Staff assumed that the City’s employer contribution retirement expenditures for current civilian and sworn employees
would grow as projected by CalPERS, the City’s retirement program administrator.
Although CalPERS identifies an “employer contribution” and “employee contribution” for retirement deposits, the
actual cost sharing between the City and employees is a bargained arrangement codified in Memoranda of
Understanding (MOUs) between the City and employee unions. CalPERS is considering a number of changes to its
pension funding rules, which could significantly impact the employer contribution cost to participating agencies, so
this is an area of substantial uncertainty in the forecast. Although the California Legislature passed a pension reform
bill in 2012, we have assumed that the legislation will have no substantial impact on Oakland’s required retirement
contributions to CalPERS during the budget period, particularly as the City is not expecting to add many new
employees during the budget period. Similarly, the budget assumes that the City’s recently adopted second tier
retirement program will not result in any retirement savings to the City during the forecast period.

Other Expenditures
Operations and Maintenance
Historically, operations and maintenance expenditures, which are composed of services and supplies and contracts,
have grown very slightly over time. O&M is estimate based upon prior year budgeted amounts and known
expenditures during the budget period.
Debt Service, Overhead, and Operating Transfers
The City’s Treasury Division estimated the future debt service expenditures based on the repayment schedule of the
City’s current debt. Debt service includes principal and interest expenses on bonds and other loans. The FY 2013-15
Adopted budget contains some updates to overhead cost recovery rates relative to past years.

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
NEGATIVE FUNDS
Many non-GPF City funds have negative balances. The poor financial standing of the funds is a result of historical
overspending and/or under-recovery, as well as operational shortfalls (cost increases outpacing revenue growth).
Funds with significant negatives projected by the end of FY 2013-15 include: Self-Insurance Liability Fund ($18.4
million), Mandatory Refuse Program ($5.4 million), Kaiser Convention Center Fund ($1.7 million), Equipment Fund
($1.1 million), and Facilities Fund ($18.2 million). These negative balances harm the overall health of the City’s assets
by borrowing from the available positive funds, such as the General Purpose Fund, internal pension assets, deferred
leave balances, etc. Except for the GPF, these other positive funds are mostly restricted, and funds borrowed from
them will require repayment.

LONG TERM LIABILITIES
Overview of Long Term Liabilities
The City has four defined benefit retirement plans: Oakland Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS), Oakland
Municipal Employees’ Retirement System (OMERS), and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System
(PERS) Public Safety Retirement Plan and Miscellaneous Retirement Plan. PFRS and OMERS are closed plans that
cover employees hired prior to July 1976 and September 1970, respectively.
The City also has programs in place to partially pay health insurance premiums for certain classes of retirees f rom
City employment. City retirees are eligible for retiree health benefits if they meet certain requirements relating to
age and service. The retiree health benefits are described in the labor agreements between the City and Local
Unions and in City resolutions.
The table below shows a summary of the long-term liabilities for the City

funded ratio is 68.2%

$553.5M

Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) has the unfunded actuarial accrued
liability (UAAL) of $520M as of June 30, 2012; City is currently taking the pay-asyou go approach

$33.8M

Accrued leaves are funded at 16.7% level, which leaves approximately $33.8M
unfunded as of June 30, 2013 (unaudited)

D - 107

FINANCIAL SUMMARIES
Unfunded Pension Liability for CalPERS – Active Retirement Plan
The City has active defined benefit retirement plans for safety and miscellaneous employees with CalPERS. Although
the funded ratios of the safety and miscellaneous plan with CalPERS are below 100%, they are within an acceptable
range of close to 80% funded, and the City will continue to maintain the required funded ratios through increases in
CalPERS’ required contributions from the City, which are already accounted for in the cost escalation of current
employees’ retirement contribution in the fringe benefit line.

Unfunded Pension Liability for PFRS and OMERS – Closed Retirement Plans
Regarding unfunded pension liability, the City has two close defined benefit retirement plans: the Oakland Police
and Fire Retirement System (PFRS), and Oakland Municipal Employees’ Retirement System (OMERS). The PFRS'
Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL) was $203.7M as of July 1, 2012 and the OMERS' retirement plan was
fully funded. The City recently issued pension obligation bonds to reduce the PFRS UAAL from approximately
$426M to $216M. The debt service on the bonds is included in the debt service portion of the forecast. As part of
the financing, the City made advanced payments for five years on its obligation to PFRS, and therefore does not
need to make any new payment until FY 2017-18. The GPF portion of the UAAL payment beginning in FY 2017-18
is estimated to be $24.2M. The City is required, by Charter, to fully fund this liability by 2026, so the GPF portion
of the payment will continue to be an average of approximately $21.5M each year through 2026.

Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB)
Like many municipalities, the City has accrued significant unfunded long-term liabilities, including for other post
employment benefits (OPEB) for police, fire, and miscellaneous employees. Public administration and financial
management best practices dictate that the City must begin to make deposits to build assets in order to offset
these liabilities. In addition, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) now requires that
municipalities report these liabilities in their CAFR and other appropriate financial reports.
According to the report from the City’s actuary, Aon Hewitt, as of September 13, 2011, the annual required
contribution (ARC) for a 30-year amortization (the maximum amortization allowed by GASB) of the police, fire,
and miscellaneous OPEB Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL) was $20,941,230, $12,413,116, and
$13,303,004 respectively, totaling over $46M per year. The City is currently paying for OPEB benefits for its
retirees on a pay-as-you-go basis, through which it pays as much each year as is required for just that year’s
expenses (approximately $16M per year). The forecast shows what the fiscal picture would be if the City chose to
make a net new investment each year to meet the full ARC, dividing the cost between the GPF and all other funds
proportionate to the amount of salary paid from each. The table below shows the City’s current and forecasted
pay-as-you-go amount, ARC, and net new expense. Note that the City’s net OPEB obligation increased in FY 201112 and again in FY 2012-13 because the City did not make the full ARC payment in those years. As a result, when
the City’s net OPEB obligation is next calculated by the actuary, the recalculated ARC will likely be higher than that
displayed in the table on the following page.

Note that the City is currently considering using existing fund balance to create an OPEB trust using funds
restricted for this purpose. If the City does take this step, it will reduce the City’s ARC necessary to fully fund this
liability. Staff is examining beginning to invest in the California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT) Fund.
Staff believes a substantial deposit of funds ($20M to $40M) to fund health and other post-employment benefit
costs for City retirees and their beneficiaries may be fiscally advisable. Investing in the CERBT will help the City
minimize future cost impacts, as the investment returns will pay for the majority of the benefit; it will
demonstrate prudent financial management, and bond rating agencies now expect an OPEB plan; and agencies
that invest in the CERBT use a higher discount rate, which will lower projected liabilities and the ARC.

Compensated Absences – Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave, and Compensatory Time
The City’s policy and its agreements with employee groups permit employees to accumulate earned but unused
vested vacation, sick leave and other compensatory time. All earned compensatory time is accrued when incurred in
the government-wide financial statements and the proprietary fund financial statements. A liability for these amounts
is reported in the governmental funds only if they are due and payable. The estimated current liability is $33.8 million.

PRIOR REDUCTIONS (CONT’D)
 Elimination of 6 FTE Legislative
Analyst’s in FY09-10 resulted in
dedicated personnel to staff
Committees, which reduced the
policy analysis and legislative
expertise required by Council.
 Reduction of 15% in City Council
budget in FY10-11 led to the
reduction in staff hours, additional
voluntary furloughs, reductions in
O&M and position eliminations.
The FY13-14 budget eliminated
furloughs citywide but all other
reductions continue.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
LEGISLATION AND CONSTITUENT
AFFAIRS
The City Council sets policy for the
City government by voting as a body
to approve legislation in the form of
resolutions and ordinances. The
Council may act on policy and
legislative recommendations from
the City Administration as well as
initiate legislation on its own.
Councilmembers and Council aides
assist individual constituents who
are having difficulty accessing a City
service or contacting a City
department by facilitating
communication between the
constituent and City departments.
Council staff and Councilmembers
cooperate with neighborhood groups
to work on neighborhood issues such
as reducing crime, improving parks
and other infrastructure, and
removing blight. Where there is no
organized neighborhood group,
Council offices help to organize
constituents to take action to
improve the neighborhood, such as
through neighborhood clean-ups and
community events.

TOP PRIORITIES & GOALS
(CONT’D)
chronic neighborhood problems
and addressing public nuisances.
 Promote open government and
accountability to the residents of
Oakland in accordance with the
letter and spirit of the law.

PRIOR REDUCTIONS
 The adopted budget of the Office of
the City Attorney for FY 2011-12 is
$11.63 million which represents a
steady decline ($3.78 million) from
the FY 2007-08 budget of $15.41
million. Over the last decade, due to
budget cuts, the City Attorney’s
office has lost 33 positions (19
attorneys and 14 support staff)
which represents more than onethird of the staff.
 17 of the positions were eliminated
by the start of FY 2009-10, with
three more rounds of budget
reductions occurring in the 2009-11
budget process. The result was a
reduction of nine additional
attorney positions and seven
support positions during the last
three years.
 Reductions have required greater
reliance on outside counsel for legal
advice, litigation support, and
transactional work, that could have
been performed more efficiently
and effectively and at lower cost
with in-house counsel.

PRIOR REDUCTIONS
Since 2008-09 adopted budget,
approximately 225 full time
equivalents (FTE) have been
eliminated from OPD’s budget. This
represents a 24% reduction in sworn
staffing and a 20% reduction in
professional staff. OPD has reduced
spending on employee services
(salaries & benefits) by $40 million,
since 2008-09 – a 19% reduction.
Prior to the adoption of Measure BB,
budget reductions had come exclusive
from within professional staff
positions. For example, in the FY
2003-05 budget, twenty (20)
dispatcher positions were eliminated.
The impacts of these cuts to service
delivery are:
 Slower response times for 911 calls
for service
Dramatic reduction in investigative
staffing, which results in a lower
clearance rate for identifying suspects
in crimes
o Increases in violent crime, notably
robberies, in areas where it had not
normally occurred in Oakland

E - 22

o Property crime has become much
more pervasive throughout the
city, because people are able to
commit property crimes with
relative impunity

 Increased overtime spending to
maintain basic service levels
 Slower response times to answer
queries for records from the public
and from other governmental agencies
 Administrative work assigned to
police officers

OAKLAND PUBLIC LIBRARY
PRIOR REDUCTIONS

SUMMARY OF HISTORICAL EXPENDITURES AND ADOPTED BUDGET BY PROGRAM

Since FY 2007-09 the Library has
reduced Branch Library days from 6
days to 5 days. The Main Library
continues to operate 7 days per
week. The reduced hours (and city
wide furlough shutdown days) have
impacted the public’s ability to
gather for programs, after school
activities, teens and pre-teens
gathering time, and increased usage
of computers with fewer days. As
well, elimination of Bookmobile
service and reductions in Second
Start Adult Literacy has impacted
outreach services to the community
provided by OPL.

seeking grants, public private
partnerships, and by enhancing
volunteerism and sponsorship
opportunities.
 Foster collaborative opportunities
with other agencies and
individuals to improve service
delivery
 Continue focusing on high-quality
service and customer satisfaction
to be the “provider of choice” for
our customers.

comprehensive access compliance
activities to City agencies as well as
the disability, business and nonprofit

and constant vandalism, heavy
patron usage, and a lack of
preventive maintenance and capital
repairs. There is currently no funding
for capital repairs.

ELECTRICAL PROJECTS
Electrical staff provides design
services and electrical engineering
review for project development and
construction. Utility coordination,
planning, design and facilitation of
assessment engineering are provided
for the utility undergrounding
program.

ENGINEERING DESIGN
Engineering Design facilitates
program and project management,
engineering and inspection services
for City activities including sanitary
sewer rehabilitation, major street
improvement, pavement
rehabilitation, bridge rehabilitation,
storm drainage, sidewalks and
utilities. This program also provides
project management services on a
wide variety of technical projects in
support of other City departments.

FLEET AND EQUIPMENT
MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
The City of Oakland owns and
operates 1,489 vehicles and major
pieces of equipment. The City’s fleet
has been reduced by 341 vehicles in
in the last ten years. A full-time City
staff of 53 mechanics, service
workers, technicians, and
administrative staff keep the City’s
aging fleet at an 89% availability
rate.
The average fleet vehicle is 10.7
years old which is more than twice
the 5.2-year replacement age
recommended by the National
Association of Fleet Administrators
(NAFA). Currently, over 55% of City
vehicles are over the NAFA
recommended replacement age.
The City can have a better
performing fleet and spend less
money overall by making capital
investments in newer equipment.

(CONT’D)

The fleet should be smaller, newer
and require less maintenance.

KEEP OAKLAND CLEAN AND
BEAUTIFUL
The Keep Oakland Clean and
Beautiful program maintains and
enhances the cleanliness, health, and
appearance of City streets and
neighborhoods. Activities include
(annually) response to 13,000
complaints for removal of illegal
dumping; abatement of 285
homeless encampments; removal of
800,000 sq. ft. of graffiti; support for
volunteer cleanup and beautification
events; and special events support
(Art & Soul, Holiday Parade, Street
Fairs, etc.); and street cleaning of 492
controlled routes monthly.

PARKING MANAGEMENT – METER
REPAIR
Oakland has a total of about 7,500
parking spaces. It consists of about
(1) 4,000 single parking meter
spaces; and (2) 500 multi-space
parking meters that control about
2,500 parking spaces. Meters are
planned for upgrade to utilize
modern technology. Revenue
generated from citations goes
directly to the general purpose fund.

PARKS, GROUNDS AND MEDIANS
Oakland has 134 parks and public
spaces. This includes two regionserving parks, nine community
parks, 53 neighborhood parks, 15
special use parks, 26 athletic fields,
plus many mini-parks, linear parks,
and public grounds. There are
another 1,055 acres of Resource
Conservation Area (open space)
primarily in the Oakland hills.
Approximately 100 landscaped
medians and streetscapes are also
included in the City's park maintenance
responsibility along with grounds at City
facilities and surface parking lots.
New and renovated parks and plans are
being developed primarily funded by
voter-supported Measure DD (2002

PROJECT DELIVERY

General Purpose Fund (GPF)

Project Delivery manages and
implements capital improvement
projects in a professional,
comprehensive, efficient, and cost
effective manner. These projects serve
the community and city employees in
the forms of new facilities, expanded
facilities, increased comfort, safety,
and modernization of facilities,
improved access for the disabled,
improved storm and sewer services
and long-term maintenance, street
beautification, and improved traffic
and pedestrian safety. The program
provides long-term planning for
facility and park assets.

Add 1.00 FTE Gardener Crew Leader and 7.50 Park Assistant PT
for Enhanced Park Maintenance

RECYCLING AND SOLID WASTE
The Recycling and Solid Waste
Disposal Program manages the City’s
franchised solid waste, organics and
recycling collection services for
161,000 homes, which include weekly
collection of recyclables, yard
trimmings and food scraps, and
garbage. The Program oversees
garbage and recycling collection
services for 5,600 businesses, and City
facility recycling improvements.
The Program is currently engaged in
procurement of Zero Waste Services
that will replace existing agreements
for citywide solid waste and recycling
services, beginning July 2015. The
Program supports and ensures the
City’s compliance with state and local
mandatory recycling requirements.
The Program ensures the City’s
compliance with the State
requirements of diverting a minimum
50 percent of solid waste from landfill
disposal, works to further reduce the
waste disposed to 75 percent
consistent with city, county and state
policy goals, and to achieve the City
goal of Zero Waste by 2020.
Activities include oversight of the
implementation of the Construction
and Demolition Debris Waste
Reduction and Recycling Ordinance,
and participation in planning and
development of sustainability
initiatives. This program also provides
the Recycling Hotline 238-SAVE
service, and education and public
information in support of all its
activities.

SAFETY AND LIABILITY
Serves all Public Works Agency
employees and aggressively addresses
and improves issues of employee safety
and training. Reduces workers
compensation claims, increases the
number of employees returning to
work, and decreasing the amount of
exposure and liability to the city.
Activities within the program include
training in sound safety and health
practices, developing and enforcing
safety and health rules, and
investigating every accident promptly
and thoroughly to determine cause and
implement proper measures to prevent
recurrence. This program works closely
with the City Attorney’s Office, the
City’s Risk Management Division and
the third party administrator.

SANITARY SEWER MANAGEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE
The City of Oakland has 919 miles of
City-maintained sanitary sewer pipes,
seven pump stations, and over 27,000
manholes and structures. Most of
Oakland’s sewer system is 60 to 70
years old. During storm events, sewer
flows are significantly increased due to
infiltration and inflow (I/I) of
stormwater into the sanitary sewer
system. The Sewer Service Charge that
is collected from all properties is now
adequate to cover the operating and
capital expenses of the program. The
sanitary sewer collection system is a
network of pipes, manholes, clean-outs,
pump stations, and other structures
used to collect all wastewater and
transport it to the East Bay Municipal

E - 61

PUBLIC WORKS
PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
SANITARY SEWER MANAGEMENT
AND MAINTENANCE (CONT’D)
Utility (EBMUD) interceptor and
treatment plant. The City of Oakland
sanitary sewer system is a collection
system only. Sewage treatment and
disposal occurs at the EBMUD
Facility near the Bay Bridge area of
West Oakland.
Conditions such as ground
movement, tree root intrusion,
quality of original pipe material, and
other factors can significantly
decrease the serviceability of sewer
pipes and manholes. In 1987, a longterm capital improvement program
was initiated to rehabilitate sewer
lines that contributed to wet weather
overflows. In 2010, the City started a
two-year flow metering and
modeling project to evaluate system
capacity and plan for the next longterm capital improvements, with an
objective to improve pipe conditions
and reduce wet-weather flows. It is
anticipated that the current level of
investment in capital improvements
will need to be sustained in order to
stay in compliance with regulatory
requirements.

STREET AND SIDEWALK
MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
The City of Oakland has 806 miles of
City-maintained streets. Buses use
150 miles of these streets. Bike
facilities are designated on 200 miles
of streets. The pavement condition is
rated by a “Pavement Condition Index”
(PCI), created by the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC)
which must be used by the City to be
eligible for federal, state, and county
funds. Oakland is on an 85-year
repaving schedule, which means a
street that is repaved today won’t be
repaved again in 85 years. Maintaining
the existing pavement condition on
Oakland’s streets would require an
estimated $28 million annually, while
our annual funding for this purpose is
totally dependent on federal, state, and
county allocations which have been less
than $6 million in recent years. The
total needed to rehabilitate Oakland
streets is over $435 million.
The City of Oakland has 1,100 miles of
sidewalk, 17,800 curb ramp locations,

E - 62

and 232 developed stairs and
pathways. A majority of Oakland’s
sidewalks, stairs, and paths are in
acceptable condition, while 60% of the
curb ramps are non-compliant or nonexisting.

STREET LIGHT MANAGEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE
Oakland has approximately 37,000
streetlights covering over 800 miles of
roadways and pedestrian passages.
Most of the lights are mounted on
wooden poles and fed directly
overhead from PG&E. 30,000
streetlights are “cobra head” fixtures on
tall poles, while about 7,000 are
ornamental pedestrian lights. In FY
2011-12, City staff responded to 2,400

street lighting service requests and
repaired 3,200 streetlights.
In general, streetlights in Oakland meet
the levels in the Street Lighting
Warrants approved by City Council;
however, there are areas that could
benefit from enhanced lighting due to
increased pedestrian usage or criminal
activities. Oakland’s current standard
for streetlights is Light Emitting Diode
(LED) fixtures for City projects and as
replacements for failed lights.

SUSTAINABLE OAKLAND PROGRAM
The Sustainable Oakland Program leads
the protection of Oakland’s natural
resources and the health of our
community through energy efficiency
and increased use of renewable energy

PUBLIC WORKS
sources, pollution prevention,
environmental cleanup and promotion
of sustainability. The program tracks
Oakland’s progress in becoming a more
sustainable city, coordinates climate
change mitigation and adaptation
initiatives, and leads internal
sustainability teams.
The program is dedicated to improving
the environmental quality of City of
Oakland facilities, open spaces, rightsof-way, waterways and development
projects through professional
environmental assessment and
cleanups, improved energy efficiency,
and implementation of best
management practices. The Program
supports the efforts of citizen
volunteers to clean and green
Oakland's streets, parks, and creeks
through the Adopt a Spot program and
major beautification events such as
Earth Day and Creek to Bay Day.
The program aggressively seeks grants
to support these efforts enabling
Oakland to be a top 10 green city in the
nation.

TRAFFIC SIGNAL MANAGEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE
Oakland’s streets include 677
signalized intersections (which include
18,000 traffic signals and 4,000
pedestrian walk/don’t walk signals).
Signals are reviewed and re-timed on
the average of once every five to ten
years due to the large number of
signals (higher than most cities of
comparable size) and few dedicated
staff to collect the traffic counts
necessary to make signal timing
changes (less than one full-time staff
employee is assigned to signal timing
and 7.5 staff are assigned to traffic
signal maintenance). Much of the City’s
signal equipment is obsolete and/or
not compatible with modern
communication systems. Maintenance
of traffic signals is provided by City
staff.
The City has developed an Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS) Master
Plan to upgrade and manage the signal
system along major corridors. Only a
small fraction of the system has been
built, and most of that in the last year. A
Traffic Management Center (TMC) was
recently completed and serves as the
nerve center for ITS corridors. More
arterial corridors which are indentified

in the ITS Master Plan would be need to
implemented. The estimated total cost
of implementing the ITS Master Plan is
$123 million in current (2012) dollars.

TRAFFIC SIGNS AND MARKINGS
MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
There are over 3,500 signal poles, and
on average, 100 traffic signal poles
have to be replaced each year from
damages. Oakland’s streets also include
200,000 traffic signs, 3,600 miles of
lane striping, 400,000 linear feet of
crosswalks and 6,000 street legends.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
TRAFFIC SIGNS AND MARKINGS
MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE

(CONT’D)

All signs, striping, and legends are
designed using the California Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices
specifications and standards as dictated
by 23 CFR 655.603. These signs,
stripes, and legends are maintained
daily by City staff, and through the
course of yearly paving contracts for
streets identified in the Five-Year
Paving Plan, as hazards are identified
or on a complaint basis.

TRANSPORTATION AND PEDESTRIAN
SAFETY
The Transportation and Pedestrian
Safety program advances vehicular and
pedestrian safety on City streets and
around schools, parks, senior centers
and other public places. Activities
include designing traffic signals and
safety devices, audible pedestrian
signal heads, pavement markings,
residential blue zones, traffic calming
systems and other engineering
approaches to making our community
safer. This program also promotes
alternative modes of transportation
such as walking and bicycling.

TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND
FUNDING
Transportation Planning and Funding
coordinates the grant application
prioritization and submittal process for
transportation projects. Deliverables
include transportation policies and
plans, bicycle and pedestrian plans and
facilities, the development of a
Complete Streets Policy and street
network, and citywide parking policy.

This is achieved through extensive
community outreach, corridor
planning, development project review
and the update and implementation of
the General Plan Circulation Element
and TOD and Transit-First policies. The
Division coordinates planning and
implementation of large-scale
transportation projects with AC
Transit, BART, Caltrans, and the Port of
Oakland.

TREE MANAGEMENT AND
MAINTENANCE
Oakland is known for its green tree
covered canopy; the 100-year-old Jack
London Oak tree symbolizes this
commitment to being a Green City. The
urban forest consists of 42,642 street
trees per the 2008 Sidewalk Survey
plus an unknown number of park trees,
median and streetscape trees, and trees
found within the street right-of-way.
Since the survey, several hundred new
trees have been planted by Urban
Releaf, Sierra Club, West Oakland
Greening Initiative and homeowners.
Major cuts to Tree Services staffing
over the past five years (over 50%)
have now limited services to
emergency tree response. The City
ended the tree planting and aesthetic
tree pruning program in 2008. Tree
staff is also responsible for processing
over 200 tree permits annually under
the Tree ordinances and the View
ordinance. All permits and hazardous
tree requests must be inspected by an
Arboricultural Inspector or Tree
Supervisor, of which there is only one
of each.

WATERSHED AND STORM DRAIN
MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE
The City’s storm water infrastructure
includes more than 400 miles of storm
drains, 15,000 structures, and over 80
miles of open creek. The majority of the
City’s storm water infrastructure was
constructed 60 to 80 years ago. Since
that time, very little to no upgrading of
the system has taken place. Much of the
system has long suffered from
inadequate resources leading to
increasing instances of flooding,
erosion, and property damage.
The City of Oakland has no fund source
dedicated to managing storm water.
Without a dedicated source of funding
for ongoing maintenance, capital

PUBLIC WORKS
improvements, and water quality
efforts the existing storm water system

with water quality regulations will be
jeopardized. Much of the system is now
nearing the end of its useful life and is
in need of replacement. An average
annual investment of $20 to $25 million

is needed for storm water system
capital projects and maintenance and
for water quality compliance.
