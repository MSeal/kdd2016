How To Read This Document
Welcome!

statements, including the adopted 20142015 budget, are presented for every fund.
The statements show the fund’s financial
condition over a number of years. Like the
checking account statement you receive
from your bank, the statement shows beginning balances, revenues, expenditures,
and ending balances for each year. Each
fund statement begins with the actual audited amounts for the 2012-2013 fiscal
year. The ending balance of the actual
year becomes the beginning balance of the
estimated 2013-2014 fiscal year. The estimated column reflects projected amounts
compared to the amounts included in the
original adopted budget for the 2013-2014
fiscal year. The estimated ending fund balance of the prior fiscal year then becomes
the beginning balance for the 2014-2015
budget year.
Accompanying the statements are narratives and graphs which
describe the major features of that particular fund. Within each fund there may be
one or more departments which further describe a component of the Town’s organization. Each department is presented with
its mission statement, a listing of the department’s accomplishments for the previous fiscal year, and operational objectives
for the 2015 fiscal year. Selected service
levels for each department are presented
graphically. Actual prior year data and estimated fiscal year 2014 data is used for
graphs and charts. The funding for each
department, as well as the unit’s staffing,
are summarized over a number of years.

Welcome to the published Town of Addison
budget for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2014 and ending September 30,
2015. This document has been specially
prepared to help you, the reader, learn of
the issues affecting the Addison community. Many people believe a city budget is
only a financial plan. Although you can
learn much of the Town’s finances from
these pages, the 2014-2015 budget document has been designed to serve other
functions as well. For example, it is a policy
document that presents the major policies
which guide how the Town is managed.
It is an operations guide which gives the
public, elected officials, and Town staff information pertaining to the production and
performance of individual Town operations.
The document is also designed as a communications device in which information is
conveyed written and graphically.

Budget Format

1

The document is divided into four major
sections: Introduction, Financial/Operational, Town Chronicle, and Appendices. The
Introduction section contains the City Manager’s letter which is addressed to the City
Council and explains the major policies and
issues which impacted the development
of the 2015 fiscal year Town budget. The
section also contains a statement of the
Town’s vision and goals, the press release
that accompanied the ordinance adopting
the budget, the Town’s organization and
staffing chart, and the summary of all financial statements. Liberal use is made in this
section of footnotes, which direct the reader
to sections of the document that more fully
describe programs or projects.

The Town Chronicle reports on issues or
special projects which affect the Addison
community. The Chronicle divides the Town
into six sectors and describes the important
events which are happening, or are scheduled to happen, within each sector. The
Chronicle also provides statistical information about the Town of Addison.

The Financial/Operational section describes various aspects of the Town’s organization. This information is grouped first
by fund and then by department. Like many
local governments, the Town uses the fund
method of accounting. Simply stated, a
fund is a unit of the Town which tracks the
application of various public resources. For
example, the Hotel Fund is established to
keep track of the use of the hotel/motel
occupancy tax. Most people are particularly interested in the General Fund which
is comprised of most of the Town’s operations like Police, Fire, and Parks. Financial

Finally, various appendices are presented
towards the end of the document which
more fully describe the budget process, the
Town’s major revenue sources, the longterm financial plans for the General, Hotel,
Airport, and Utility Funds and a capital project summary. Also included are the Town’s
financial policies, a glossary of terms, the
Town’s compensation and merit pay plans,
and departmental organization charts.

Letter to the Mayor and Council
The Honorable Mayor and
City Council,
Adopting the annual Town budget represents
the City Council’s most important work. The
budget articulates priorities and policies
that are considered the most critical for the
Town. It is a series of decisions designed
to continue the Town’s reputation as an
attractive place to work, play and live.
Last year was a great year for Addison.
The local economy once again saw many
gains which resulted in higher occupancy
rates in our commercial areas, increased
hotel bookings, and additional sales for our
retailers and restaurants. The Town enjoyed
a nine percent increase in property values
and an increase in sales tax revenues of
eleven percent. The Village on the Parkway
redevelopment hit a major milestone with
the completion of the parking garage that
will provide parking for the many new
restaurants and retail offerings opening in
the center. Another exciting development
was the opening of the Addison TreeHouse;
a collaborative effort involving the Dallas
Entrepreneur Center, Baylor University’s
Accelerated Ventures Program, and the
North Texas Small Business Development
Center. The Addison TreeHouse creates
an entrepreneurial eco-system to connect
individuals with resources that companies
need in order to be successful. In the
short time open, the Treehouse has
been extremely successful. Additional
development has continued across the
Town. Several new owner-occupied town
homes and condominium units were
completed as part of the Meridian Square
development. Twenty new restaurants
opened in new or existing restaurant
spaces, and over $66 million in commercial
improvement projects were permitted in
Fiscal Year 2013-14. These activities grow
the Town’s revenue base which, in turn,
allows the Town to maintain the high level
of service to the community and continue
investing in the future.
This budget represents a fiscal program
aimed at building for such a future, and
is based on specific initiatives identified
as priorities by the City Council, including
the following: framing compensation in
the context of the adopted City Council
philosophy; implementing a plan for
improved road replacement, maintenance

T

and rehabilitation; creating a financial
mechanism to move faster on needed
infrastructure improvements and act on
opportunities in a more strategic manner;
continuing to promote fiscal transparency;
and rebalancing and “right-sizing” staffing.
These initiatives and the Council’s desired
outcomes for each were instrumental in
the development of the FY15 budget and
subsequent long term plan. Furthermore,
these budget initiatives are strategic actions
aimed at fulfilling Council’s primary goals
of creating raving fans of the “Addison
Experience,” practicing mindful stewardship
of Town resources, maintaining and
enhancing our unique culture of creativity
and innovation, and continuing to find ways
to celebrate our diversity as a Town.

Compensation:
Prior to budget development, Council and
staff spent considerable time discussing a
proposed compensation philosophy. The
goal was to accomplish three objectives:
(1) define the Town’s competitive market–
those cities the Town competes with to
recruit top talent; (2) determine the Town’s
market position regarding salaries; and
(3) articulate how employees will move
through salary ranges. As a result of those
deliberations, Council reaffirmed the current
compensation philosophy statement and
expanded the statement, found in Appendix
C.
Based on that philosophy, $514,313
was allocated for market adjustments
for positions the Town continues to have
issues hiring and retaining; and $705,500
was allocated for merit increases (between
two and five percent), depending on job
performance.

Infrastructure Investment Fund
In keeping with Council’s priority of investing
in the future, this budget contains the
foundation for an exciting new approach to
funding the Town’s aging infrastructure: the
Infrastructure Investment Fund (IIF). The IIF
will enable the Town to reduce its reliance
on debt by dedicating resources to capital
related projects. The new Fund is seeded
by a one-time transfer of $4,000,000 from
the General Fund and is supported by
e x a s

u d g e t

.0062 cents of the Town’s Maintenance and
Operations (M&O) tax rate. Not only will this
Fund begin to reduce reliance on bonded
debt, it will also enable Council to act on
opportunities in a more timely and strategic
manner.

proposed Emergency Communications
budget reflects those additional costs as
well as the costs of operating the Town’s
current dispatch operations until such time
as the center becomes operational.
In addition to new initiatives, the Town continues to strengthen its infrastructure and
amenities. The $20 million Belt Line Road
undergrounding of utility lines will enhance
the Town’s beautification measures. The
Airport has finished installing its EMAS
(engineered materials arrestor system),
increasing the safety, security, and marketability of the airport, which remains a key
attribute of Addison’s renowned services.
Sewer, water and stormwater infrastructure
will see $8.4 million in enhancements and
rehabilitations, which will broaden Addison’s capacity for business and residential
growth. A lot is happening in Addison; it is
an exciting place to be.

Financial Audit:
While the IIF fortifies the Town’s financial
position, a review of the Town’s accounting
and finance functions, undertaken at the
Council’s direction, strengthens the Town’s
public trust by increasing fiscal transparency.
Utilizing the COSO framework, the study
reviewed the Town’s internal controls and
made a number of recommendations based
on that framework and best practices. As
a result, a number of recommendations,
including the need to hire additional staff,
were addressed in this budget.

The FY15 budget is a result of the initiatives
and priorities established by Council. It
builds upon the foundation and plants the
seeds for a bright and secure future for the
Town. It is a fiscal plan that seizes upon our
strong financial condition and advances
Council initiatives, maintains healthy
reserves, and recognizes the unparalled
efforts of our staff, all with the goal of
providing Addison with a fresh beginning
toward a brighter, more prosperous future.

Rebalancing and
“right-sizing” staffing

3

During budget deliberations, Council articulated a priority of rebalancing and rightsizing the staff. To that end, certain areas
within the Hotel Fund were reorganized
to increase efficiency and effectiveness.
Specifically, the Visitor Services department
has been eliminated. The hotel liaison and
programmatic efforts formerly housed in the
Visitors Services Department have been
moved to a reconstituted Economic Development and Tourism (EDT) department.
In addition to these staffing changes, personnel supported by the Hotel Fund have
implemented a series of cost-cutting measures. These budgetary efficiencies along
with an increase in hotel occupancy taxes
substantially improve the overall health of
this fund. Accordingly, the Hotel Fund is
expected to realize, after expenditures, an
estimated fund balance at the end of FY1415 that is well above the 25 percent specified by the Town’s financial policies.

Respectfully Submitted,

Lea Dunn
City Manager

Finally after much study and review, the
implementation of a joint dispatch center
involving the cities of Carrollton, Farmers
Branch and Coppell was begun this year and
is scheduled to be completed by the fourth
quarter of 2015. This new center will allow
the Town to benefit from shared emergency
services of neighboring cities. As part of this
project, there will be costs associated with
the build-out and leasing of the new center
as well as training the current dispatchers
on new procedures and systems. The FY15

“Addison Way”
It is a philosophy that serves as the cornerstone of our service delivery model to our
stakeholders. The heart of the “Addison Way” is staff’s charge to find a way to say
“yes” to service requests rather than responding that they cannot do something. The
staff searches out all options to try and meet expectations during each customer service
interaction.

Council’s Values
The Council will at all times seek to enact policies that will promote, and to personally
exemplify, the values of the Town of Addison. The Council values:

General Fund
Fund Description

of materiality. The differences in revenues,
expenditures, and a higher beginning fund
balance contributed to an estimated ending
fund balance of $14,563,977, which is
$2,006,903 more than budgeted.

The General Fund accounts for resources
traditionally associated with governments
which are not required to be accounted for
in another fund.

2014-2015 Budget Narrative

Fund Narrative

There are four components that make up
the Town’s ad valorem tax rate of $0.5618
per $100 of appraised value: operations
& maintenance, debt service, economic
development and dedicated funding for the
Infrastructure Investment Fund. A tax rate
of $0.3110 is levied to generate revenues
to fund the operations and maintenance
activities budgeted in the General Fund.
The revenue generated from this portion
of the tax rate will increase by 0.9 percent
in FY2015 to $11,736,390. In order to
accommodate the Town’s annual debt
service requirement, a tax rate of $0.2181 is
levied to generate $8,230,560, an increase
of $843,900 from FY2014. A third tax rate
of $0.0265 is levied to provide dedicated
revenues for economic development
purposes and is reflected in the Economic
Development Fund. The fourth component
of the tax rate provides funding for the
Infrastructure Investment Fund, a fund
dedicated to funding capital projects on an
as needed basis. The rate for this portion is
$0.0062. Sales tax revenues for FY2015
are projected at $13,500,000, a 10.2
percent increase from FY2014 budget.
Other revenues in the General Fund are
expected to remain stable or experience
modest gains compared to last year’s
budget.

During the budget process, it is the
General Fund which receives the most
attention from Town staff, the Council,
and the public. The attention is deserved
because it is this fund that reflects most of
the critical issues affecting the community,
from establishing a tax rate to determining
employee staffing and benefits. The
following narrative reports the major
aspects of the General Fund budget for
both the concluding and new fiscal year.
Operational accomplishments and goals
are reported in the department narratives.

23

Concluding Fiscal Year
Performance
Revenues for FY2014 are estimated at
$31,710,501 which represents an increase
of $1,011,731, or 3.3 percent, over
FY2014 budgeted revenues and is a 6.3
percent increase over FY2013 revenues.
Revenues collected from property taxes
are expected to come in just 1 percent
less than budgeted. Sales tax collections
continue to improve, and FY2014
revenues are projected to exceed budget
by $1,250,000 or more than 10 percent.
License and permit revenue dropped 21
percent from FY2013 actual receipts, due
in part to the decrease in submittal of plans
for construction and redevelopment of
projects currently underway.1

Total fund expenditures for the 2015 fiscal
year have been appropriated at $32,908,876
which is $1,431,435 more than the FY2014
budget. Total personal services (employee
salaries and benefits) rose by $2,130,372.
Most of the increase is attributed to a 10
percent increase in health insurance costs,
market adjustments to key positions, and
merit increases, in which employees are
eligible to receive a 2 to 5 percent increase
in their base salaries, Contractual costs
also increased by $984,165, primarily
due to Town contributions toward the
establishment of the multi-city emergency
communications dispatch center as well as

Expenditures are expected to total
$31,125,922 which is $351,519 less than
the FY2014 budget. Two of the operating
departments in the General Fund are
expected to exceed their budget but all
excess spending in those departments
was below 1 percent of total departmental
budget, and therefore below the threshold

policies.2 The long-term financial plan for
the General Fund anticipates adjusting
expenditures for a 3 percent inflationary
increase each year along with moderate
increases in revenue. Assuming continued
strong showings in revenues and modest
increases in expenditures, the Town
projects a gradual increase in fund balance
to a level of 40 percent of operating
expenditures.3

The net impact on revenues and
expenditures is a projected $4,837,986
decrease in fund balance, used to fund
one-time modified levels of service, and
to fund the Infrastructure Investment Fund
with $4,000,000 in seed money. The ending
fund balance of $9,725,991 represents
29.7 percent of operating expenditures,
which is above the 25 percent minimum
balance required by the Town’s financial

Debt Service Funds
Net outstanding general
obligation debt..................... $87,647,000

General Obligation
Debt Service Fund

The Town has adopted two policies to limit debt issued in the future. First, as part
of the long-term financial plan adopted
for the General Fund, the Town intends
to utilize surplus operating funds to support capital projects.1 In those instances
when debt has to be issued for projects
which cannot be delayed, a second policy
stipulates that debt will not be issued for
any period longer than 15 years, except
under special circumstances, in order to
rapidly retire outstanding debt.

Fund Description
The debt service funds, also known as interest and sinking funds, are established
by ordinances authorizing the issuance of
bonds and providing for the payment of
bond principal and interest as they come
due. In the General Obligation Debt Service Fund, an ad valorem (property) tax
rate and tax levy is required to be computed and levied that will be sufficient to
produce the money to satisfy the annual
debt service requirements. General obligation bonds of the Town carry an “Aa1”
rating from Moody’s Investors Service and
a “AAA” rating from Standard and Poor’s
Ratings Service.

The Town’s legal capacity for additional
debt is very large. Rules promulgated by
the office of the Attorney General of Texas
stipulate that such Office will not approve
tax bonds of any city unless the city can
demonstrate its ability to pay debt service
requirements on all outstanding tax debt,
including the issue to be approved, from
a tax level of $1.50 per $100 of valuation,
based on 90 percent collection of the tax.
Assuming the maximum tax rate for debt
service of $1.50 on the 2014 taxable
assessed valuation of $3,805,580,841
at 90 percent collection, tax revenue
of $51,375,341 would be produced.
This revenue could service the debt of
approximately $530 million issued as 5
percent 15-year serial bonds, which is
more than $415 million greater than the
Town’s outstanding obligations.

Fund Narrative

77

The Town issued $19,565,000 of new debt
during the 2014 fiscal year and also refunded the 2004 Airport CO which had an
outstanding liability of $2,095,000. Shown
below is the Town’s debt position as of the
beginning of FY2015.

Fund Narrative

Hotel Occupancy
Tax Debt Service Fund

The financial statement for this particular
fund is fairly straightforward. Transfers are
made to the fund from the Hotel Fund, sufficient for supporting annual debt service
requirements. Although the Town pledged
its full faith and credit for repayment of
debts, including the levying of a property
tax rate if needed, there will be sufficient
resources in the Hotel Fund to pay for the
annual debt service and support operating
expenditures.

Fund Description
The Hotel Occupancy Tax Debt Service
Fund receives, as a transfer from the Hotel
Fund, occupancy taxes to meet the debt
service requirements associated with the
$8,000,000 of certificates of obligation issued in 2003 to fund the additions and improvements to the Arts and Events District.
The issue carries the Town’s “Aa1” and
“AAA” general obligation ratings.

Capital Project Fund
Fund Description

Impact of Capital Projects on
For FY15, the Town consolidated all cap- Operating Budgets
ital project funds into one fund. This fund
was created to account for proceeds from
the sale of general obligation or revenue
bonds to be used for the acquisition or
construction of major capital facilities. Descriptions of the projects are included in the
Town Chronicle section of this document.
Budgets are developed by project and may
transcend more than one fiscal year.

When considering new capital projects,
the Town must ensure that it raises
enough operating revenues to cover any
increased levels of service created by the
new projects. In other words, as projects
in the Capital Project Fund are completed,
there is usually a need for funding to
cover ongoing maintenance, utilities, other
operating costs, and sometimes additional
personnel or equipment. This year the
total estimated net operating cost of the
Town’s newly completed capital projects
paid for from the Capital Projects Fund will
be the following: $19,500 from the Parks
operating budget for increased lighting,
landscape, and irrigation maintenance
on new streetscapes and pedestrian
connectivity projects and various other
maintenance
costs;
$10,000
from
the Stormwater operating budget for
miscellaneous bridge and channel repair;
$2,500 from the Stormwater operating
budget and $2,500 from the Parks budget
for general facility maintenance on the
Surveyor Learning Center; and $26,000
from the Airport operating budget primarily
for maintenance on the new EMAS system,
perimeter access system, Automated
Weather Operations System (AWOS), taxi
lane maintenance, and additional clean
out activities for the airport’s new EMAS
drainage.

Fund Narrative
The Capital Project Fund Summary section provides brief descriptions of some of
the major projects that will be in progress
during FY 2014 - 2015 and a discussion of
the relationship between the capital budget and the operating budget. A list of the
proposed projects in the current plan and
related funding sources can be found in
the Addison Town Chronicle section.

81

The budget for fiscal year 2015 reflects
$900,000 for Midway Road design,
$8,839,774 for Vitruvian Park Public Infrastructure, $3,000,000 for Acquisition of
Land and Streets, $18,579,670 for Belt
Line Utility Relocation, $2,274,473 for
Addison Road rehabilitation, $3,310,000
for pedestrian connectivity projects, and
$355,000 for Vitruvian Park Amphitheater
renovation, and $3,000,000 for Public
Safety radio replacement.1

Additional increases are absorbed in various department operational budgets as
staff find efficiencies within their operations, striving to continue to deliver an excellent level of service within the current
department funding levels.

Airport Fund
Fund Description

ble for the billing and collection of all revenue related to rentals, leases, fuel flowage
fees, and miscellaneous income.

The Town of Addison owns a general aviation airport, which the Town considers to
be one of the community’s greatest assets.
Addison Airport is a single runway facility and is ranked by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) as one of the busiest airports of its kind. The airport is used
extensively by corporate executives who
wish to conduct business in offices located
in the North Dallas area.

85

Under the terms of the two agreements,
URS will submit each year to the Town a
budget that will fund all airport and real
estate functions. All expenditures will be
made in accordance with the budget as
approved by the City Council. These operating expenditures are supported with
revenue generated by the airport. Each
company is compensated for their services
with URS receiving a base annual fee of
$170,000 plus 2.5 percent of revenue received in excess of $4 million. SAMI receives a base annual fee of $120,000 with
financial incentives for realizing increased
revenues from the airport.

The airport’s operations are financed and
operated in a manner similar to private
business enterprises, where costs of providing the services to the public are financed primarily through rentals, leases,
and user charges. The fund’s financial
summary is distinguished from those of
other funds in that it resembles the income
statements of private corporations. In addition to the income statement, there is included a statement of changes in working
capital which is defined as current assets
(e.g. cash, investments, accounts receivable) less current liabilities (e.g. accounts
payable, accrued interest payable, etc,).
For the Airport Fund, working capital represents fund balance. The statement of
changes in working capital reports significant financial transactions such as acquisition of fixed assets or retirement of debt
that are not included in the income statement.

For the 2014 fiscal year, operating revenue
is projected to total $4,720,507 which is 8.2
percent more than budget. The increase in
revenues is a result of increased fuel flowage fees and commercial rental income,
with the latter resulting primarily from the
acquisition of the Wiley Post and Glenn
Curtiss properties. Operating expenses
are estimated to come in $449,772 or 14.1
percent less than budget. Uses of working
capital include the Town’s local match for
capital grants to maintain and enhance airport facilities.
For fiscal year 2015, the budget anticipates operating revenue of $4,825,075, a
10.5 percent increase from the 2014 budget. Total operating expenses increase by
$290,321 or 9.1 percent from the previous year’s budget, again due to increased
maintenance expenses due to deferred
projects from previous years. The budget
includes $257,000 as the Town’s local
match for FAA/TxDOT capital projects.
Working capital in the upcoming fiscal year
is expected to decrease $782,007 from the
prior year budget, primarily due to retirement of long-term debt (bonds), capital expenditures for grant matching and equipment replacement, and a low net operating
income resulting from the need to address
deferred maintenance issues on the airport including the S4 hangar ramps.

Fund Narrative
The Town of Addison has contracted with
a private operator for operation and maintenance of the airport. The Town has contracted with URS Energy & Construction
(URS) to perform all functions directly associated with the management, operation
and maintenance of the airport and related
facilities. URS is also responsible for developing, in coordination with the Town, a
capital improvement program and obtaining capital grant funding from the FAA and
the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) Aviation Division. All real estate
functions, including rental of Town facilities
and the management of ground leases,
have been contracted to SAMI Management, Inc. (SAMI). SAMI is also responsiT

Fund Description

Fund Narrative

The Town’s water and wastewater utilities
are financed and operated in a manner
similar to private business enterprises,
where costs of providing the services to
the public are financed primarily through
user charges. The fund’s financial summary is distinguished from those of other
funds in that it resembles the income statements of private corporations. In addition
to the income statement, there is included
a statement of changes in working capital
which is defined as current assets (e.g.
cash, investments, accounts receivable)
less current liabilities (e.g. accounts payable, accrued interest payable, etc.) For
the Utility Fund, working capital represents
fund balance. The statement of changes in
working capital reports significant financial
transactions such as acquisition of fixed
assets or retirement of debt that are not
included in the income statement.

Operating revenues for fiscal year 2014
are projected to total $10,265,539, which is
$15,693 more than budget and $537,153
less than was generated in fiscal year
2013. Operating expenses are projected
to be at the budgeted amounts. Anticipated
ending working capital totals $8,456,838,
which is $1,048,680 or 14.2 percent more
than budget.

Budgeted operating revenues total
$10,588,726, an increase of $323,187
from the previous year. Operating expenses are budgeted at $8,403,099, an
increase of $212,120 over the prior year.
This increase is due primarily to an increase in the purchase price of water and
sewer services, while the Town was able to
hold operating costs flat. Working capital is
projected to decrease $4,360,560 due to
capital projects.

Fund Description

Program Narrative

The Town’s stormwater utility is financed
and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises, where costs
of providing the services to the public are
financed primarily through user charges.
The fund’s financial summary is distinguished from those of other funds in that
it resembles the income statements of private corporations. In addition to the income
statement, there is included a statement of
changes in working capital which is defined as current assets (e.g. cash, investments, accounts receivable) less current

interest payable, etc). For the Stormwater
Fund, working capital represents fund balance. The statement of changes in working
capital reports significant financial transactions, such as acquisition of fixed assets or
retirement of debt that are not included in
the income statement.

Accomplishments of FY2014
• Finalized Master Plan and study of
Keller Springs Stormwater Basin.
• Began study of Hutton Branch Stormwater Basin.
• Began designs for the desilting projects for both Les Lacs and Winnwood
Ponds.
• Began water sampling of Les Lacs
Pond.
• Finalized design of storm sewer improvements associated with the Belt

Objectives for FY2015
• Begin design and construction for
the Keller Springs and Hutton Branch
Basin Improvements.
• Begin construction of Winnwood Pond
De-silting project.
• Begin comprehensive curb and gutter
replacement program.

Fund Narrative
The Stormwater Fund was created in
2013 to address the necessary stormwater
activities and capital projects. The fee will
fund the costs to build and maintain stormwater infrastructure such as curb and gutter
repair, maintenance of stormwater structures, and the Town’s federally and state
mandated stormwater quality management
program. Additionally, the stormwater fee
will fund the capital improvements to the
Town’s drainage infrastructure, including
drainage relief systems, detention facilities, and improvements to the Les Lacs
and Winwood ponds.

• Begin study of Rawhide Creek Stormwater Basin to examine most effective
stewardship of town resources.
• Begin construction of stormwater improvements associated with the Belt
Line Road Underground Utilities project.
Notable Budget Items

•

Pond Desilting Design ($147,496)
Hutton Branch Study ($257,900)
Rawhide Creek Basin Study ($300,000)
Pond Desilting Construction ($900,000)
Keller Springs Basin Improvements

Operating revenues for fiscal year 2014
are projected to be $1,552,000 and the
FY2015 budget for operating revenue is
$1,675,350. Working capital is estimated
to be $5,451,605 at the end of FY2015.
The FY2015 budget assumes working
capital will decrease approximately $2.4
million due primarily to expense related to
capital projects and retirement of debt.

Replacement Fund
Fund Description

ance. The statement of changes in working
capital reports significant financial transactions, such as acquisition of fixed assets
which are not included in the income statement.

This fund is intended to accumulate sufficient resources to replace existing computer systems (equipment and software)
that have reached or exceeded their useful lives. Resources are acquired through
charges to operating departments. The
charges are calculated using a straightline amortization of each component of a
system based upon the component’s expected life. When a component of a system
has reached the end of its projected useful
life, a decision is made as to whether the
component should be replaced. If the component is still working as intended and is
not requiring excess maintenance expenses, it will be kept in service. However, once
the component has been fully amortized,
the department will stop making payments
to the fund for that item. Interest income
earned by the fund and proceeds from the
sale of surplus equipment will offset the impact of inflation on the replacement costs
of equipment.

Fund Narrative
Expenses in FY2013-14:
• Work Order $70,000
• Addison Park Wireless $65,000
• AAC camera system upgrade $40,000
• Rugged Laptops – FD $23,650

Scheduled purchases for FY2014-15:
• ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
system ($1,600,000)
• Document Management ($150,000)
• In-Car Video Camera and  Mobile Data

Capital Replacement Fund
Fund Description

95

statement of changes in working capital,
which is defined as current assets (e.g.
cash, investments, accounts receivable)
less current liabilities (e.g. accounts payable, accrued interest payable, etc.). For
the Capital Replacement Fund, working
capital represents fund balance. The statement of changes in working capital reports
significant financial transactions, such as
acquisition of fixed assets which are not
included in the income statement.

This fund was established to accumulate
sufficient resources to replace existing
equipment that has reached or exceeded its useful life. Resources are acquired
through charges to operating departments
in the General Fund. The charges are calculated using a straight-line amortization
of each piece of equipment based upon
the item’s expected life. When a piece of
equipment has reached the end of its projected useful life, a decision is made as
to whether the equipment should be replaced. If the costs of retaining the equipment (e.g. maintenance expenditures and
length of down-time) do not exceed a predetermined amount, the item will be kept
in service. However, once the equipment
has been fully amortized, the department
will stop making payments to the fund for
that item. Interest income earned by the
fund and proceeds from the sale of surplus
equipment will offset the impact of inflation
on the replacement costs of equipment.
The fund is also used to finance replacement equipment in those instances in
which the cost of replacement far exceeds
the original cost of the equipment. In these
instances, the fund purchases equipment
“on loan” to the user departments at a loan
rate equivalent to the yield the fund receives on its invested cash.

Fund Narrative
Expenses in FY2014 were primarily
associated with the purchase of (1) Mobile
Intensive Care Unit Ambulance (MICU),
(1) dump truck, (5) service trucks, (2) utility
vehicles and (8) treadmills. Equipment
purchases included in the fiscal year 2015
budget include:
• Fire – Quint Fire Truck ($780,000)
• Fire – Prevention Vehicle ($32,000)
• Police – Animal
($47,000)

Infrastructure Investment Fund
Fund Description

Impact of Capital Projects on
Operating Budgets

The Infrastructure Investment Fund was
created in FY15 to accumulate resources
to support pay-as-you-go capital projects,
building a reserve to reduce the Town’s reliance on debt for capital projects.

When considering new capital projects,
the Town must ensure that it raises enough
operating revenues to cover any increased
levels of service created by the new projects. In other words, as projects in the Infrastructure Investment Fund (IFF Fund)
are completed, there is usually a need for
funding to cover ongoing maintenance,
utilities, other operating costs, and sometimes additional personnel or equipment.
This year the total estimated net operating
cost of the Town’s newly completed capital projects paid for from the IFF Fund will
be $500, from the Parks operating budget,
in estimated miscellaneous annual repairs
on the Les Lacs Park and Town Park Playground structures.

Fund Narrative

97

The Fund was created this fiscal year not
only to reduce reliance on debt by dedicating resources to capital related projects but to also enable Council to act on
opportunities in a more timely and strategic manner. The FY15 Budget transfers
$4,000,000 from the General Fund to the
newly created Infrastructure Investment
Fund (IIF) for future capital items. Additionally, $0.0062 of the property tax rate has
been dedicated to funding the IIF for future
appropriations. Together with the transfer
from General Fund reserves, the dedicated portion of the tax rate is budgeted to
bring the Infrastructure Investment Fund
balance to just over $4.2 million. The assignment of capital improvement projects
for the 2014-2015 Fiscal Year to the IIF
brings the projected ending fund balance
to approximately $3.06 million.

Additional increases are absorbed in various department operational budgets as
staff find efficiencies within their operations, striving to continue to deliver an excellent level of service within the current
department funding levels.

The budget for fiscal year 2015 Infrastructure Investment Fund reflects $150,000 for
City Wide Streets and Sidewalk Assessment and Evaluation, $200,000 for Addison/Surveyor Road Railroad Crossing Improvements, $350,000 for Les Lacs park
and Town Park Playground Structures and
Re-surfacing, $180,000 for Celestial Park
Trail Replacement, and $300,000 for the
Airport ILS.1

Addison Town Chronicle
Town Description
The Town of Addison is located in
the Dallas North Parkway area that
encompasses the Dallas suburbs of
Carrollton, Farmers Branch, and Plano.
The area is home to affluent residential
neighborhoods, multiple corporate office
parks, scores of quality restaurants, and
the prestigious Galleria Dallas shopping
center. The area commands a central
location in reference to downtown Dallas,
DFW International Airport, the Richardson
telecommunications corridor, and the
Plano Legacy corporate campus area.
The Town of Addison epitomizes the best
features of the area. The Town places a
special emphasis on quality of life that demands all developments meet the most
rigorous building requirements. For example, all commercial developments must
submit landscaping plans to ensure attractive green areas accompany buildings.
The attention to aesthetics extends to all
of the Town’s major boulevards, which are
also landscaped. This approach has made
Addison a cosmopolitan “downtown uptown” distinguished from almost any other
urban area in the nation. The Town’s blend
of residential, retail, and office uses creates an open environment that avoids the
confining effect usually associated with
densely developed areas.
The Town’s reputation for maintaining
a high quality of urban life has attracted
considerable development over the past
few years. Addison is home to 95 office
buildings providing nearly 10 million square
feet of office space, and an additional 47
retail buildings representing approximately
two million square feet of space. Most of
Addison’s office buildings are designated
“Class A” due to the amenities they offer.
The Town boasts 22 hotels with 3,953
rooms and over 170 restaurants, or an
average of 46 per square mile.
Because of its concentration of commercial and retail development, Addison is

particularly susceptible to changes in the
regional and national economies. The national recession greatly impacted the local
economy and the revenue generated by
Addison’s businesses, however we are
beginning to see signs that we are emerging from the downturn. The Town’s taxable
appraised values as of January 1, 2014
rose 9.04 percent, which is the second
significant annual increase in values since
before the recession. The increase can be
attributed to Addison being in the midst of
an economic boom in the community, with
the redevelopment of Village on the Parkway ($90 Million investment) continuing.
The redevelopment of Village on the
Parkway continues this year with the
construction of the AMC movie theatre
and the addition of new restaurants and
retailers. Multi-family growth slowed over
the last year, with no new apartment
construction.1 Sales tax for the 2015 fiscal
year is expected to remain flat compared to
the prior year’s collections and Addison’s
hotels, which cater primarily to business
travelers, are beginning to experience
improved bookings resulting in a 9.32
percent increase in hotel occupancy tax
for the 2014 fiscal year compared to the
previous fiscal year.
Although Texas has been impacted by the
national recession, its economy continues
to expand, evident by the 4.5 percent
annual growth in employment, up from 2.3
percent annual growth last year.2 Over the
past year, Texas’ unemployment rate has
decreased 1.4 percent to 5.1 in July 2014,
and remains lower than the U.S. rate of
6.2 percent.3 The Dallas Fed Outlook
Survey points to continued economic
growth in the near term, helped by strong
improvement in commercial real estate
activity and continued vitality in the energy
sector.4 The Town of Addison will share
in any economic recovery experienced by
the region and the state, but employment
trends indicate that Texas will finish 2014 at
a 2 percent annual growth rate. This rate is
in line with the average rate of growth over

the past couple of decades. For purposes
of easily identifying the events affecting
the community, the Town has been divided
into six planning sectors. The remainder
of this chronicle section focuses on the
attributes of each area of the Town and
summarizes the issues, programs, and
projects related to the sectors. Estimates
for costs related to capital projects are
derived from current costs of engineering,
building, or operating projects of similar
scope, with no adjustment for inflation.

Sector 1
Sector Description
This sector of the Town is the most topographically interesting of the community.
A small creek runs to the east parallel
Belt Line Road and creates several small
ponds before it reaches White Rock Creek.
Running along the two creeks is a jogging
trail that leads to the uniquely landscaped
Celestial Park. Perhaps because of these
amenities, the area contains the Oaks
North, Bellbrook, and Winnwood subdivisions, three of the more affluent residential developments in the Town, if not the
entire North Dallas area. The northwest
section of Sector 1 contains a mixture of
retail and restaurant establishments.

Town-wide (All Sectors)
Sector Description
Described here are projects that span
across the entire Town, or serve the Town
as a whole. As a mid-life municipality,
Addison is in the midst of significant
infrastructure upkeep. Project categories
of particular interest include water and
sewer utility infrastructure, drainage and
bridge upkeep and repair.

101

Capital Projects
Immediate (1-12 months)
Celestial Park Trail Replacement - This
project involves the removal of the existing
decomposed granite trail and replacement
with a concrete trail to reduce the ongoing
maintenance of the granite material.

Capital Projects
Immediate (1-12 months)

Winnwood Ponds Desilting – In order to
improve the water quality in the Winnwood
Pond, the pond will be desilted and the
material will be hauled off and disposed of
according to appropriate regulations.

Town Wide Streets and Sidewalk Assessment and Evaluation - In order to ensure
that streets and sidewalks are maintained
at an acceptable level, it is important to
identify the current condition of the infrastructure. The first step is to perform a
city-wide street and sidewalk assessment
that will grade each street and sidewalk
as to whether it is good, fair, or poor. A
capital improvement program will be developed from that assessment.
Intermediate (12-36 months)
Public Safety Radio Replacement $5,000,000 in bonds were sold to cover
equipment and non-recurring costs of both
radio replacement and the new combined
dispatch center.
Illuminated Street Name Sign Replacement
- Replace 137 existing illuminated signs
with more energy efficient LED street
name signs and cabinets, replace old
logo with new logo, and improve energy
efficiency and maintenance requirements.

Intermediate (13 to 36 months)

Sector Community Issues
The Town has made a significant investment int he redevelopment of the Village
on the Parkway retail complex, which is
nearing completion. The center is home
to Visit Addison, a 26,000-square-footspace that houses the Town’s Special
Events department, the Metrocrest Chamber of Commerce, and the Craft Guild.
Total operating expenses are budgeted at
$847,992 for FY2015. As the center completes its transformation, staff expects the
site to require continued attention. Eventually, the additional traffic will most likely necessitate improvements on Montfort
Drive including a signalized intersection
near the southern end of the site.

Sector 2
Sector Description
The most densely developed section
of the Town is in Sector 2. Within this
area are the Quorum Office Park, two
convention hotels, several motels, and
most of the Town’s restaurants and retail
establishments. The major thoroughfares
of Belt Line Road, Inwood Road, Midway
Road, and the Dallas North Tollway
influenced the rapid growth of the area.
The area is bisected by the St. Louis and
Southwestern railroad line.

Capital Projects
Immediate (1-12 months)
Pedestrian Connectivity (South Quorum)
- This is the first phase of the North and
South Quorum Pedestrian Connectivity
improvements, which are funded from the
2012 Bond Program. The improvements
will include enhanced pedestrian and
street lighting in the south Quorum area
that will replace the existing 35-year-old
street light system. Additional pedestrian
connectivity improvements in the North
Quorum areas will depend upon available
funding and future development.

Pedestrian Connectivity (Undesignated) This funding will be used as contingency
funding for either of the North and South
Quorum or Beltway/Proton Pedestrian
Connectivity Projects.

Sector Community Issues
Addison Beverage Center – When Addison
began developing in the early 1980’s it
was the first city in the North Dallas area
to allow for the sale of packaged (versus
restaurant sale) alcoholic beverages. The
Town’s Charter originally required that the
sale of these beverages be limited to a onemile section of Inwood Road. In November
2010, voters approved a proposition to lift
the Inwood Road restriction on beer and
wine sales and allow those to be sold
Town-wide. This has caused a change in
land use on Inwood Road and vacancies
in retail centers. This will be the subject
of a special study conducted as part of
the wider Comprehensive Land Use Plan
update currently underway.

102

Sector 3
Sector Description
The majority of the Town’s population and
single-family housing is contained within
the boundaries of Sector 3. Prominent
features of the sector include Fire Station
2, the Addison Athletic Club, Redding
Trail (formerly Les Lacs Linear Park), the
private Greenhill School, and DISD’s Loos
Field athletic complex. The sector includes
the Vitruvian Park development area and
the new George H.W. Bush Elementary
School.

Sector Description
The distinguishing feature of this area is
the Addison Airport, one of the busiest
single-runway general aviation airports
in the region. The airport has attracted
considerable commercial activity, including
several hangar/office complexes. The
southern and western areas of the sector
encompass almost all of Addison’s light
industrial development. Located within

Accomplished
Roof Repair - New Duro-Last roofing systems were installed on four airport-owned
properties, including three conventional
hangars and one T-hangar.
EMAS Installation - Construction began in
April 2014 and was completed in September 2014 for this project costing $8,000,000.
EMAS is designed to safely stop a jet running off the end of the runway at speeds up
to 70 knots (just over 80 mph). The project
also included a water line replacement /
relocation, extensive storm water drainage
improvements including concrete-lined detention areas, and a $200,000 rain water
harvesting system.
Airport Master Plan Update - The $230,000
project (90 percent TX-DOT/FAA and 10
percent airport funded) began in April
2014 and is expected to require 12-14
months to complete.
Wildlife Hazard Assessment - The
Wildlife Hazard Analysis (WHA) stated
that Addison has documented about 130
wildlife strikes since 1990. The report
identified the various wildlife seen during
the 12-month observation. Briefly, the
report discussed a few ways to mitigate
wildlife hazards on the airport but that
discussion will be expanded in the Wildlife
Hazard Plan (WHP) that Keleinfelder will
provide.
Immediate (1 to 12 months)
Automated Weather Ops. System Update
(AWOS) - The AWOS generates real-time
weather reports every minute. AWOS
weather reports are made available to
airport personnel via displays on operator
terminals and to pilots via high quality,
digitized voice transmissions, using a
VHF frequency or voice-capable NAVAID.
AWOS reports are also available by
telephone for flight planning and can be
sent to the FAA’s Weather Network for
flight planning purposes.

Perimeter Access Controls and Monitoring
System – The airport undertook a study
to determine what security upgrades are
needed. Those recommendations have
been presented in a report and will be
implemented as funding is available.
Taxiway Bravo/Golf Extensions, Service
Road – The project will include the
engineering/design for reconstruction
and extension of Taxiway Bravo north to
Taxiway Golf to meet Design Group III
standards, extension of Taxiway Golf west
(330 x 75 feet) from Runway 15-33 to
connect to Taxiway Bravo, and extension of
the south end of Taxiway Bravo to connect
to Runway 33 (550 x 50 feet). Project will
include construction of concrete vehicle
service road west of Taxiway Bravo from
the Bravo T-hangars to Taxiway Golf.
Long-Term (37 to 60 months)
Runway Designation Change, Rejuvenation – Runways are given a number
designation with a number from 1 to 36
that corresponds to their magnetic heading. Due to the drift of Earth’s magnetic
poles, a change in runway designation is
occasionally necessary. As of November
2014, the locations of the magnetic poles
have changed enough to require a change
in runway designations. Changing the runway designations requires changing the
paint markings, airfield guidance signs,
and various navigation charts and publications.

Additionally, the runway was reconstructed in 2011. Application of a pavement
rejuvenator product to extend the life of
the asphalt pavement is considered good
practice, and an opportune time to do that
is when the pavement is around 5 years
old and when the markings are being
changed to reflect the change in runway
designation.

In addition, a cash reimbursement from
TX-DOT Aviation for 90 percent of the appraised land value (totaling $1,910,420 for
both properties) is anticipated in FY17.

Taxilane Uniform Rehabilitation/Drainage

Sector 5
Sector Description

Keller Springs Road/Addison Road Intersection - The intersection improvements
have been designed and will be considered along with the overall improvements
to Addison Road.

The smallest of the planning sectors,
Sector 5 contains Addison’s old business
district. While the area had been among the
least developed in the Town, the Addison
Circle development has transformed this
sector into a vibrant nucleus of the Addison
community. The Addison Circle Urban
Community District combines extensive
park and median landscaping with upscale
multi-family housing and small retail shops
in the North Quorum area. The sector is
also home of the Arts and Events District
which includes the Addison Conference
Centre and Theatre and Addison Circle
Park, which is used extensively for special
events such as Addison Oktoberfest, Fork
and Cork and Addison Kaboom Town.

Hutton Branch Basin Improvements - A
detailed stormwater facilities plan will
determine the infrastructure needs and
timeframe for improvements.

The airport has focused on rejuvenation
efforts that continue to keep Addison
Airport ahead of the curve in safety,
updated technologies, and comprehensive
planning for future development. The
Access Controls Study, a $100,000 project
(90 percent TX-DOT/FAA – 10 percent
airport funded) completed in July 2013,
resulted in recommendations to improve
operational safety and physical security
at the airport, which will be implemented
via future grant projects. Additionally,
the Airport Master Plan outlined in this
Town Chronicle guides the airport’s future
development through the year 2025. The
last master plan update was done in 2003.

Addison Circle Development – The
Addison Circle development is near buildout. Phase II of the Allegro apartments
took the last available parcel in Addison
Circle.  The 121-unit apartment project
opened in April of 2013.  Addison Circle
began as a vision crafted by the Addison
2020 Committee, which was established
in 1992 to envision Addison’s future.
The project broke ground in 1997 and
has transformed Addison’s profile and
confirmed its brand as a true urban
destination. The award-winning, nationally
acclaimed
mixed-use
development
now boasts 2,141 multi-family units,
407 townhome and condominium units,
550,000 square feet of office space, and
75,000 square feet of retail space.
DART Rail – Located near the Addison
Circle Urban Community District and the
Arts and Events District (discussed in
greater detail in the Sector 5 narrative)
is the DART transit center that is used by
over a dozen bus routes serving Addison
and the North Dallas corridor. The center
is adjacent to the former Cotton Belt
railroad line that is now owned by DART.
The line extends to the DFW International
Airport and represents an opportunity for
commuter rail that would serve the area.
The Town contracted with a consultant to
study the issue. The result of their analysis
is that the rail line serves more companies
and a greater employment base than the
entire Dallas central business district.
DART has included the project in its longterm 2035 capital plan. Addison staff
will work to ensure the project is high
on the agency’s priority list. The Town is
continuing to pursue various innovative
financing initiatives with DART and
others. The Town also needs to advance
the planning for the development of the
property adjacent to Festival Way and the
rail line.

Financial Policies
Introduction

	

The Town of Addison, Texas financial policies set forth the basic framework for the
fiscal management of the Town. These
policies were developed within the parameters established by applicable provisions
of the Texas Local Government Code and
the Town of Addison City Charter. The policies are intended to assist the City Council
and Town staff in evaluating current activities and proposals for future programs.
The policies are to be reviewed on an annual basis and modified to accommodate
changing circumstances or conditions.

	 e. A
 statement proposing any capital
expenditure deemed necessary for
undertaking during the next budget
year and recommended provision for
financing.
	 f. A
 list of capital projects which should
be undertaken within the next five
succeeding years.
	

Sections 1-6 are requirements set forth
in the Town’s Charter.
1. T
 he fiscal year of the Town of Addison
shall begin on October 1 of each calendar year and will end on September 30
of the following calendar year. The fiscal year will also be established as the
accounting and budget year.

4. A
 t least one public hearing shall be conducted before the City Council, allowing interested citizens to express their
opinions concerning items of expenditure, giving their reasons for wishing to
increase or decrease any items of expense. The notice of hearing shall be
published in the official newspaper of
the Town not less than 15 days or more
than 30 days following date of notice.

2. T
 he City Manager, prior to August 1 of
each year, shall prepare and submit to
the City Secretary the annual budget
covering the next fiscal year, which
shall contain the following information:
	

g. A
 five-year financial plan for the General, Hotel, Airport, and Utility Funds.

3. T
 he City Manager’s budget should assume, for each fund, operating revenues that are equal to or exceed operating expenditures. The City Manager’s
budget message shall explain the reasons for any fund that reflects operating expenditures exceeding operating
revenues.

d. A
 description of all outstanding bonded indebtedness of the Town.

a. T
 he City Manager’s budget message
shall outline the proposed financial
policies for the next fiscal year with
explanations of any changes from
previous years in expenditures and
any major changes of policy and a
complete statement regarding the financial condition of the Town.

5. F
 ollowing the public hearing, the City
Council shall analyze the budget, making any additions or deletions which
they feel appropriate, and shall, at least
three days prior to the beginning of
the next fiscal year, adopt the budget
by a favorable majority vote. If the City
Council fails to adopt the budget, the
Town shall continue to operate under
the existing budget until such time as
the City Council adopts a budget for the
ensuing fiscal year.

	 b. A
 n estimate of all revenue from taxes and other sources, including the
present tax structure rates and property valuations for the ensuing year.
	 c. A

 n final adoption, the budget shall be in
effect for the budget year. Final adoption
of the budget by the City Council shall
constitute the official appropriations for
the current year and shall constitute the
basis of the official levy of the property
tax. Under conditions which may arise,
the City Council may amend or change
the budget to provide for any additional
expense.
7. T
 he annual budget document shall be
published in a format that satisfies all
criteria established by the Government
Finance Officers Association’s Distinguished Budget Program. The final
budget document shall be published no
later than ninety days following the date
of the budget’s adoption by the City
Council.

Basis of Accounting
and Budgeting
1. T
 he Town’s finances shall be accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
as established by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
	 a. T
 he accounts of the Town are organized and operated on the basis
of funds and account groups. Fund
accounting segregates funds according to their intended purpose
and is used to aid management in
demonstrating compliance with finance-related legal and contractual
provisions. The minimum number of
funds is maintained consistent with
legal and managerial requirements.
Account groups are a reporting device to account for certain assets and
liabilities of the governmental funds
not recorded directly in those funds.
Governmental funds are used to account for the government’s general
government activities and include
the General, Special Revenue, Debt
Service and Capital Project Funds.
	

b. G
 overnmental fund types use the flow
of current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under the
modified accrual basis of accounting,
revenues are recognized when susceptible to accrual (i.e., when they are
“measurable and available”). “Measurable” means the amount of the
transaction can be determined,
and “available” means collectible
within the current period or soon
T

o w n

T

enough thereafter to pay liabilities
of the current period. Substantially
all revenues are considered to be
susceptible to accrual. Ad valorem,
sales, hotel, franchise and tax revenues recorded in the General Fund
and ad valorem tax revenues recorded in the Debt Service Fund are
recognized under the susceptible to
accrual concept. Licenses and permits, charges for services, fines and
forfeitures, and miscellaneous revenues (except earnings on investments) are recorded as revenues
when received in cash because they
are generally not measurable until
actually received. Investment earnings are recorded as earned since
they are measurable and available.
Expenditures are recognized when
the related fund liability is incurred,
if measurable, except for principal
and interest on general long-term
debt, which are recorded when
due, and compensated absences,
which are recorded when payable
from currently available financial
resources.
	 c. T
 he Town utilizes encumbrance accounting for its governmental fund
types, under which purchase orders,
contracts and other commitments for
the expenditure of monies are recorded in order to assign that portion
of the applicable appropriation.
	 d. T
 he Town’s proprietary fund types
are accounted for on a flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting. Under this method, revenues are recorded when earned,
and expenses are recorded at the
time liabilities are incurred.
2. T
 he Town’s annual budgets shall be
prepared and adopted on a basis
consistent with generally accepted
accounting principles for all governmental and proprietary funds except
the capital projects funds, which adopt
project-length budgets. Also, depreciation of fixed assets is not recognized in proprietary fund budgets. All
annual appropriations lapse at fiscal
year end. Under the Town’s budgetary
process, outstanding encumbrances are reported as assignments of
fund balances and do not constitute
expenditures or liabilities since the
amounts will be expended the subsequent fiscal year.

3. T
 he issuance of Statement 34 by GASB
has influenced the creation and reporting of individual funds. GASB 34
essentially mandates dual accounting
systems: one for government-wide
(i.e. the government as a single entity) reporting and another for individual
fund reporting. Under GASB 34 for individual funds, the Town will continue
utilizing the accounting and budgeting
processes as described in paragraphs
1 and 2 of this section. However, because GASB 34 mandates the flow of
economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting for
the government-wide reporting, extensive reconciliation must be performed
to present aggregated fund information
in the government-wide reporting model. Therefore, individual operating funds
will be created with the objective of reducing fund to government-wide reconciliation as much as possible. When
appropriate, individual funds will be examined as to whether it will be appropriate to account for them as proprietary
fund types. Also, the Town will limit the
use of internal service funds and incorporate the financial transactions of
those funds into other governmental
funds.

approved by the City Council. Budget
amendments calling for new fund appropriations must also be approved by
the City Council.

Financial Reporting
1. F
 ollowing the conclusion of the fiscal
year, the Town’s CFO shall cause to be
prepared a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) in accordance
with generally accepted accounting
and financial reporting principles established by GASB. The document shall
also satisfy all criteria of the Government Finance Officers Association’s
Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting Program.
2. T
 he CAFR shall show the status of the
Town’s finances on the basis of GAAP.
The CAFR shall show fund revenues
and expenditures for governmental
funds on both a GAAP basis and budget basis for comparison purposes. In
all but two cases this reporting conforms to the way the Town prepares its
budget. Compensated absences (accrued but unused sick leave) are not
reflected in the budget but are accounted for in the CAFR’s long-term debt account group. Depreciation expense is
not shown in the budget’s proprietary
funds, although the full purchase price
of equipment and capital improvements
is reflected as uses of working capital.

Budget Administration
1. A
 ll expenses of the Town shall be made
in accordance with the adopted annual
budget. The department level is the legal level of control enacted by the Town
Charter. Budgetary control is maintained at the individual expenditure
account level by the review of all requisitions of estimated purchase amounts
prior to the release of purchase orders
to vendors.

3. Included as part of the CAFR shall be
the results of the annual audit prepared
by independent certified public accountants designated by the City Council.
4. T
 he CFO shall, within 60 days following
the conclusion of each calendar quarter, issue a report to the City Council
reflecting the Town’s financial condition
for that quarter. The quarterly report format shall be consistent with the format
of the annual budget document.

2. T
he following represents the Town’s
budget amendment policy delineating responsibility and authority for the
amendment process. Transfers between expenditure accounts in one
department may occur with the approval of the Chief Financial Officer
(CFO). Transfers between operating
departments may occur with the approval of the City Manager and CFO
provided that a department’s total
budget is not changed by more than 5
percent. Transfers between funds
or transfers between departments
that change a department’s total budget by more than 5 percent must be
accomplished by budget amendment

shall levy two property tax rates: operation/maintenance and debt service.
The debt service levy shall be sufficient
for meeting all principal and interest
payments associated with the Town’s
outstanding general obligation debt for
that budget year. The debt service levy
and related debt service expenditures
shall be accounted for in the Debt Service Fund. The operation and maintenance levy shall be accounted for in
the General Fund. The operation and
maintenance levy will be established
within the 8 percent rollback rate as
defined by the State of Texas Property Tax Code. City Council will consider
exceeding the rollback rate only after
options have been presented by staff
to avoid the rollback by increasing revenue from other sources or reducing
expenditures.
3. T

capital improvements.
6. T

the City Manager shall project revenues from every source based on actual collections from the preceding year
and estimated collections of the current

The revenue projections for each fund
should be made conservatively so that
total actual fund revenues exceed budgeted projections.

interest income within the constraints
of the Town’s annually adopted investment policy. That policy established
the following six objectives: a.) conformance with all Federal regulations,
State of Texas statutes and other legal
requirements including the Town Charter and Town Ordinances, including this
Policy, b.) preservation of capital and
the protection of investment principal,
c.) maintenance of sufficient liquidity
to meet anticipated disbursement and
cash flow, d.) marketability of the investment if the need arises to liquidate the
investment prior to maturity, e.) diversification to avoid incurring unreasonable
risks regarding securities owned, and
f.) attainment of a market rate of return
equal to or higher than the performance

by the CFO of the Town which is commensurate with the acceptable risk and
liquidity objectives of this policy.

Compensation Plan
Merit and Market Pay Plan

N = Non-Exempt Position (hourly).
Eligible for overtime pay when overtime is
requested or approved by the supervisor in
excess of 40 hours in any work week.

The purpose of the merit and market pay
plan is threefold: to encourage excellence
in service by tying salary increases to job
performance rather than tenure; to reward
employees for their efforts and job performance; and to remain competitive with other metroplex cities in regards to the Town’s
compensation program. We will annually
budget for Market and Merit adjustments
for compensation that are fair and sustainable.

E = Exempt Position (salaried). Not
eligible for overtime wages.
P = Police, Non-Exempt Position (hourly).
Biweekly wages are calculated on hours
worked in two 40-hour work weeks. Overtime wages are paid on hours worked in
excess of 40 hours in any work week.
Non-exempt (hourly) employees accumulate up 2,080 hours per year. Dispatcher
hourly wages are based on a 38.75-hour
work week, or 2,015 hours per year. Overtime wages are paid on hours worked in
excess of 38.75 hours in any work week.

119

Performance evaluations for all employees are completed during the month of
September, regardless of the anniversary
date of an employee’s employment. Any
approved merit increases are awarded
during the month of October. There is no
set time interval employees can expect to
reach the top salary of their range.

F = Fire, Non-Exempt Position (hourly).
Hourly wages are based on a 56-hour work
week, 2,912 hours per year or 168 hours
per 21-day work period. Half time overtime
applies on the first nine hours worked over
159 hours each 21-day work period. Regular time plus one-half applies on all hours
worked over 168 hours each 21-day work
period.

Included in the 2014-2015 budget is a merit increase in which employees are eligible
to receive a 2-5 percent increase in their
base salaries.
Promotions generally result in an immediate salary increase of at least 5 percent
without regard to the date of the last increase. New employees who have yet
to complete their initial trial periods by
October 1 will be eligible for an increase at
the completion of their trial periods, which
lasts a minimum of six months.

Major Revenue Sources
The revenue sources described in this
section account for $55,741,067 or 81.7
percent of the Town’s total operating revenues (excluding interfund transfers).

collections, which includes the payment of
principal and interest on general obligation
long-term debt. The tax rate for the year
ending September 30, 2015 is 56.18¢ per
$100 of valuation, of which 34.37¢ is allocated for general government operation
and maintenance and 21.81¢ is allocated
for retirement of general obligation longterm debt. Of the 34.37¢ allocated for operations and maintenance, 2.65¢ is committed to economic development.

Property Taxes

121

Property (ad valorem) taxes attach as an
enforceable lien on property as of each
January 1. The Town’s property tax is levied each October 1 on the assessed value
listed as of the prior January 1 for all real
and business personal property located in
the Town. Assessed values are established
by the Dallas Central Appraisal District
(DCAD) at 100 percent of the estimated
market value and certified by the Appraisal
Review Board. The assessed taxable value for the roll as of January 1, 2014, upon
which the fiscal year 2015 levy is based,
is $3,805,580,841. This amount is net of
$419,085,309 (representing 11 percent of
taxable value) of agricultural, homestead,
over-65, disabled veteran, and other exemptions. Although new construction in
recent years has been strong, Addison
experienced a slight decrease over the
last year. New construction is valued at
$85,089,490 on the 2014 certified tax roll,
which is a decrease of 12.9 percent over
the previous year. The steady increase in
overall values is due in large part to the
moderate expansion of the Texas economy, in contrast to the sluggish progress on
the national stage. However, Addison has
experienced growth in economic development, and recognizes that the local economy is cyclical. The Town continues to
realize increased values particularly those
related to the Vitruvian Park development,
and expects a continued growth as the nation’s economy stabilizes.1

In Texas, county-wide central appraisal
districts are required to assess all property within the appraisal district on the basis
of 100 percent of its appraised value and
are prohibited from applying any assessment ratios. The value of property within
the appraisal district must be reviewed every five years; however, the Town may, at
its own expense, require annual reviews
of appraised values. The Town may challenge appraised values established by
the district through various appeals and,
if necessary, legal action. Under this arrangement the Town continues to set tax
rates on property. However, if the tax rate,
excluding tax rates for retirement of bonds
and other contractual obligations, adjusted for new improvements, exceeds the
rate for the previous year by more than 8
percent, qualified voters of the Town may
petition for an election to determine whether to limit the tax rate to no more than 8
percent above the tax rate of the previous
year. The tax rate that equates to an 8 percent increase above the prior year rate is
known as the “rollback rate.” The FY2015
tax rate adopted by the Town is less than
the calculated 57.8359¢ rollback rate.
Taxes are due January 31st following the
October 1st levy date and are considered
delinquent after January 31st of each year.
Based upon historical collection trends,
current tax collections for the year ending
September 30, 2015 are estimated to be
99 percent of the levy and will generate
$21,165,960 in revenues.

The Town is permitted by Article XI, Section 5 of the State of Texas Constitution
to levy taxes up to $2.50 per $100 of assessed valuation for general governmental services, and must demonstrate, at
the time of issuing bonds to the Attorney
General, that it can pay annual debt service at a maximum $1.50 tax rate at 90%

Fund long-term plan assumes a 2 percent
growth in sales tax for FY2016 through
2019.

Sales Tax

Another sales tax levied by the State of
Texas is the alcoholic beverage tax which
is applied against all mixed drinks and
packaged liquor sold in the Town. As of
January 1, 2014, however, H.B. 3572 has
changed how Mixed Beverage taxes are
calculated. The bill lowered the 14 percent
Mixed Beverage Gross Receipts to 6.7
percent, while adding a beverage sales
tax of 8.25 percent. Like the general sales
tax, these taxes are collected by the State.
The Town’s share of the dollar revenues
generated by the tax through FY2015 will
be 10.7 percent of the States’ collections.
The modification significantly impacts a
city like Addison, with its numerous restaurants and hotels. Although Addison has
less than 15,000 residents, its concentration of hotels and restaurants make it
the 12th highest city in Texas for alcoholic beverage sales, surpassing Irving with
a population of 216,290 and Frisco with
a population of 116,989 (2010 Census).
Revenues from Mixed Beverage tax combined with the beverage sales tax are projected at $820,000 for the 2015 fiscal year,
compared to the approximately $800,000
collected in FY2014.

The sales tax in Addison is 8.25 percent of
goods or services sold within the Town’s
boundaries. The tax is collected by businesses making the sale and is remitted to
the State’s Comptroller of Public Accounts
on a monthly, and in some cases, a quarterly basis. Of the 8.25 percent tax, the
State retains 6.25 percent and distributes 1
percent to the Town of Addison and 1 percent to the DART mass transportation authority. The State distributes tax proceeds
to local entities within 40 days following the
period for which the tax is collected by the
businesses.
For the year ending September 30, 2015,
the Town of Addison expects to receive
$13,500,000 in sales and use tax revenue. This amount is equal to the revenue projected for FY2014 collections of
$13,500,000 and a 10.2 percent increase
over the FY2014 budget. Monthly collections during FY2014 averaged about
10.5 percent above what was collected
in FY2013, far more than Dallas County’s
6.28 percent increase, and the State’s 6.29
percent increase. The Town’s General

Hotel/Motel Occupancy Tax

123

FY12	

In 2013, Addison was ranked number 19
in the State in total hotel revenues out of
over 550 Texas cities reporting, ahead of
cities like Richardson with a population
of 99,233 (2010 Census).2 In total hotel
revenues, the Town experienced an 8.7
percent increase from $71,058,875 in
2012 to $77,265,830 in 2013.3

The occupancy tax is levied by both the
Town and the State against a hotel or motel’s gross occupancy receipts on a monthly basis. The Town’s tax is 7 percent, the
maximum allowed by law, and is levied
along with the State’s 6 percent rate. Revenue generated by the tax is restricted by
State law to directly enhance and promote
the tourism, convention, and hotel industries. According to State law, individuals
renting rooms for more than 30 consecutive days are exempt from paying the tax.

In hotel occupancy tax receipts, the Town
continued to show significant gains in
FY2014 with year-over-year growth for hotel tax receipts of approximately 7.6 percent, and end-of-year receipts estimated
at $4,922,495.  For the year ending September 30, 2015, the Town occupancy tax
is budgeted at $5,439,311.

Franchise Fees
Effective January 1, 2002, the method of
collecting franchise payments changed
with the partial deregulation of electric
power in Texas. In the past, the Town received franchise fee payments once per
year based on 4 percent of Oncor’s total
electric sales within Addison. Under deregulation, the franchise fee payment has
been replaced by a per kilowatt hour fee.
The fee is calculated by taking the total
franchise amount paid by Oncor to Addison in 1998 and dividing the amount by the
number of kilowatt hours sold that same
year. For FY2014, that fee was calculated
to be $0.002671. Competing retail electric
providers (REPs) will collect a per kilowatt
charge from their customers and then remit
the fee to Oncor’s regulated transmission

and distribution company. Oncor will then
pay the Town the fee revenue collected
from the REPs. The Town expects to receive $1,500,000 as an electric franchise
fee payment in FY2015.
Additionally, after litigation against increased franchise fee payments, a court
ordered the return of the increased revenue paid by Oncor to the Town. This
mandate has ordered that the revenue
be reimbursed by decreasing franchise
fee revenues by approximately $11,000
per quarter for the next 12 quarters. This
mandate will affect fiscal years 2015-2017.
Although this litigation is still pending appeal, the Town is preparing for this budget
adjustment to begin in calendar year 2015.

Utility Fees

Deregulation of the telecommunications
industry and Federal laws governing the
treatment of telecommunication companies by cities caused the Texas State Legislature to review the methods by which
cities are compensated by telecommunication companies for use of public rightof-ways. A law was passed in 1999 that
required cities to be compensated based
on the number and type of telecommunication access lines each company has in a
particular jurisdiction. This method of compensation is different from the percentage
of gross receipts formula historically used
by most cities. The law was passed with
the goal of maintaining the cities’ revenue
base. Using guidelines promulgated by the
Texas State Public Utilities Commission,
cities across the state developed access
line fees that were implemented on July 1,
2000. In Addison, the computed fees that
are added to telecommunication customer
monthly bills currently are as follows:4

125

The Town of Addison charges fees for the
provision of water and sewer services to
residents and businesses located within
the Town. The Town utilizes a comprehensive utility rate structure which is based
upon charging minimum bills for customer classifications depending upon the demand each classification places upon the
utility system. This structure allows the
fund to equitably recover a greater portion
of its fixed expenses through a relatively
constant revenue stream.
In FY2013, the Town Council approved
changes to water and sewer rates in order
to account for the increase in cost of service from Dallas Water Utilities and Trinity
River Authority, respectively. As such, water and sewer rates increased slightly this
year. Under these rates, each customer
will pay a minimum monthly bill depending
upon how their account is classified. For
example, a single-family customer will pay
a minimum rate of $10.74 for water and
$13.35 for sewer, which includes 2,000
gallons, totaling $24.09 each month. At the
other end of the scale, a commercial customer with a meter greater than two inches in size pays a minimum monthly bill of
$260.15, with an allowance of 37,000 gallons. Sewer charges are dependent upon
the volume of water consumed and are
structured similar to the water rates. The
exception to this rule is single-family residential customers who cease paying sewage fees once water consumption exceeds
8,000 gallons. The combined monthly water and sewer bill for a single-family residence that consumes 10,000 gallons is
$69.33.

(Residential lines) $1.10

(Non-residential or business lines) $2.65

The FY2015 budget anticipates $665,000
from telecommunication access line fees.
While this revenue source has seen significant decline in past years with the
movement away from traditional land line
telephone service, the popularity of “bundle” packages where customers can bundle land line telephone, Internet, and cable services has stabilized this revenue
source.
Other franchise fees paid to Addison include gas, cable, and street rental fees.
For FY2015 cable franchise fees are budgeted at $280,000. In 2011 the cable franchise structure changed in Texas where
cable companies will now begin reporting
under a state cable franchise agreement
rather than individual local agreements.
The transition had little financial impact,
as cable companies were still required to
remit 5 percent of their gross receipts. Gas
franchise fees for FY2014 are budgeted at
$175,000, and various street rental fees
are budgeted at $7,000.

The Town’s rate schedule includes a conservation water rate that was first implemented in 2003. This rate applies to all
customers with irrigation meters and single-family customers who consume more
than 15,000 gallons in a month. The conservation rate is $4.66 per 1,000 gallons
compared to the base water rate of $2.37
per 1,000 gallons over the minimum.
This section includes a distribution of customers by classification and the approximate percentage of contribution each
classification made to water and sewer op-

Stormwater Fees
The Town of Addison charges a stormwater fee to fund the costs to build and
maintain stormwater infrastructure such
as curb and gutter repair, maintenance
of stormwater structures, and the Town’s
federally and state mandated stormwater
quality management program. Additionally, the stormwater fee will fund the capital
improvements to the Town’s drainage infrastructure. The Town’s Stormwater Fund
anticipates receiving $1,675,350 in Stormwater fees.

Appendix E
Long-Term Financial Plan
the growth in economic activity is beginning to show signs of improvement with
general tax revenues expected to increase
slightly over the next few years. In the Hotel
Fund, the operating balance built up during
the economic expansion period had been
drawn down significantly in FY2013. In
order to retain or recover a balance of at
least 25 percent of operating expenditures
as established by the financial policies that
govern Addison’s budget development, the
2013-2014 budget curtailed Hotel Fund
operating expenditures to minimize the disparity between revenues and expenditures,
and the 2014-2015 budget continues these
operational efficiencies wherever possible.
Additionally, although the General Fund
balance has been drawn down in FY2015
to fund major infrastructure improvements
and to seed the new Infrastructure Investment Fund, its fund balance has remained
above the 25 percent threshold due to
stronger economic vitality in property values and sales tax revenues in particular.

Narrative

127

In accordance with the Town’s financial
policies, the 2014-2015 budget was developed in context of long-term financial
plans. The plans anticipate funding needs
and available revenues and forecast methods for matching future revenues and expenses. Plans have been developed for all
the Town’s major operating funds: General,
Hotel, Airport, and Utility. Each plan presents the fund over seven fiscal years: two
previous years, the adopted “base year”
budget for fiscal year 2015, and four projected years. There are several benefits
to these plans. First, the plans give future
Councils a valuable perspective when considering budgets within each plan’s fiveyear horizon. Second, the plans impart a
measure of discipline on Town staff. The
plans establish funding ceilings on recurring operating expenditures. Department
directors may only exceed these ceilings
by presenting requests to the City Manager
and Council that provide new or expanded services to the community. Operating
budgets are increased only when Council
votes to approve each request. This ensures compliance with the Town goal of
mindful stewardship of Town Resources.

These financial controls are premised
on the principle of balancing the Town’s
budget. In order to ensure fiscal stability
of the Towns’ operations, the Town relies
on a balanced budget to ensure responsible spending of public funds. A balanced
budget occurs when the total sum of revenues collected in a fiscal year is equal
to its expenditures. This principle ensures
adequate resources and funding to cover
ongoing city operational expenditures.

Finally, the plans help the Town in absorbing the impact of economic booms and
busts. The Town of Addison is particularly
susceptible to economic fluctuations due
to its dense commercial base. Although the
Town has slightly more than 15,000 residents (2013 Census estimate), because of
its office buildings, hotels, restaurants, and
shops, it is estimated that the Town serves
a population in excess of 150,000.1 By establishing funding ceilings, revenue generated by an economic “boom” is added to
fund balance so that funds are available to
support city services when the inevitable
economic “bust” arrives. This aspect of the
plans is exercised in all four operating funds
with the planning horizon beginning with
the 2015 fiscal year. The Town is emerging
from the weak economic conditions of the
past few years that were associated with
the national economic recession. Indeed,

General Fund Long-Term Plan
The plan reflects the following assumptions based on historic trends and knowledge of economic conditions present when
the budget was developed:
1. Non-property taxes increased 8.9 percent from fiscal year 2013 to the estimated 2014 total. The FY2015 budget
assumes a slight .14 percent growth in
sales tax compared to the prior year’s
budget. The projected years of 2016
through 2019 assume modest 2 percent
annual increases.

2. Property tax revenue is dependent on
two variables: appraised value and
the tax rate. Property values for 2014
(used for the 2013 levy) increased 8.9
percent; this is the third year in a row
of increased in values. From FY2012
through FY2014, values have increased
a cumulative 23.7 percent. The Town’s
focus on expanding their economic development efforts has improved economic trends throughout the community,
and has helped spur the majority of our
new construction and redevelopment
throughout the community. The tax rate
established for the 2015 fiscal year is
56.18 cents per $100 assessed values,
a decrease from the previous year. The
Town’s interest and sinking portion of
the rate provided an additional $843,900
for debt service, while increasing the
maintenance and operations funding by
$522,730. Of this amount, $206,630 is
directed to the Economic Development
Fund, $233,980 is contributed to the
newly established Infrastructure Investment Fund, and the remaining $112,120
for General Fund activities. The General
Fund long-term plan assumes 4 percent
average increase of appraised values
from fiscal year 2015 to 2016, and 2 percent for fiscal year 2017 to 2018. Much
of this expected growth can be attributed to new construction each year and
increased value in multi-family residential.
3. All other revenues during the planning
horizon are expected to increase a modest 2 percent per year.
4. Approximately two-thirds of the General Fund’s expenditures are associated
with employee compensation. The base
2015 year budget for personnel services is $920,353 more than the 2014
budget due to the addition of 4.3 FTE,
and a council approved merit increase
as a part the compensation study that
was conducted by Public Sector Consultants. Future years project a three percent increase in compensation.
5. D
 ue to the uncertainty of healthcare
cost an additional five percent was added to the budget to cover any increase
to the organization.
6. The 2015 budget reflects a $227,330
decrease in appropriations for maintenance projects associated mainly with

the Town’s parks, and technology and
city manager departments. Contractual
services are up $734,372 primarily as a
result of the costs associated with services to be rendered to the Parks, Recreation, Emergency Communication, Finance, General services, and Combined
Services departments.
7. The General Fund makes contributions
to the Town’s Capital Replacement and
Information Technology Funds that essentially amortize capital equipment
used by General Fund operations so
that when the equipment needs to be
replaced, resources have been accumulated to purchase replacement equipment.
8. All operating expenditures for fiscal
years 2016 through 2019 are adjusted
for a 3 percent inflationary increase. If
possible, when the Town experiences
revenues that do not support projects,
departments will accommodate for this
inflationary increase in supplies or contractual services through operational efficiencies or reductions to scope of services delivered to the public.
9. For fiscal years 2016 through 2019, expenditures are not projected to exceed
revenues. The Town has prepared a
long-term approach that allows the organization to reduce the fund balance
to a level of 30 percent of the operating expenditures. This allows the Town
to maintain compliance with its fund
balance policy and elevate the Town’s
financial burden for non-recurring and
capital expenditures. Assuming a modest growth of ad valorem and sales tax
revenues, fund balances gradually rise
through 2019, at which point the $13.7
million fund balance will represent 40
percent of operating expenditures.
Should economic conditions deteriorate, however, the town will increase its
tax rate to maintain the 30 percent fund
balance that has been set as a benchmark by the Council.

Hotel Fund Long-Term Plan
Addison’s hotels cater to the business traveler and therefore are tied to the national
and regional economies. In recent years,
due to the national recession, hotel occupancy tax declined almost 23 percent from
fiscal years 2008 through 2011. However,

the tax experienced a modest recovery in
both 2011 and 2012, with 2014 estimated
revenues increasing 7 percent over 2013.
The plan reflects the following assumptions:

related to critical public services, much
of the Hotel Fund’s budget is associated with marketing and the production
of special events which can be reduced
should hotel occupancy taxes decline in
future years.

1. 
Hotel occupancy tax revenue for the
2015 budget is expected to be higher
than estimated 2014 numbers by 7.1
percent. For the 2016-2019 planning period, revenues from the tax are expected to increase 3 percent per year. The
inventory of hotel rooms is assumed to
remain constant at 3,953.

Airport Fund Long-Term Plan
The goal of the Airport Fund’s plan is to
generate sufficient revenues to support
operating expenses as well as to fund
capital projects in order to minimize the issuance of debt. Also, in recent years the
Airport Fund has been able to capitalize on
the opportunity to continuously improve its
infrastructure with federal and state matching grants.

2. Proceeds from special events in 2014
fall behind prior year results by two percent due to the change of Taste Addison to Fork and Cork. Event revenue
for the 2015 budget period is expected
to remain constant with 2014 expected
results, and projected to experience 3
percent annual increases for the 20162019 planning period.

129

1. 
Operating revenue increased slightly
in 2015 due to the increase of rental
income. For fiscal years 2016 through
2019 revenues are assumed to increase
by two percent annually.

3. Rental of the Addison Conference Centre is estimated to fall short of its prior
year budget by $57,100, but expects to
increase 4.8 percent in fiscal year 2015
as the Town continues to implement
changes. Subsequent years anticipate
3 percent annual increases in rental revenue. Visit Addison center is expected
to generate $300,000 and increase 3
percent annually from fiscal years 2016
through 2019.

2. Operating expenses for the 2015 budget will be 8 percent greater than the
2014 budget, primarily due to continued
emphasis on maintenance projects that
were delayed in previous years due to
financial constraints. Over the planning
horizon, expenses are expected to increase by 3 percent per year.
3. 
The plan recognizes the debt service
associated with the 2005 and 2013 issuances of certificates of obligation funding the airport’s fuel farm and other various capital projects.

4. Operating expenditures are forecasted
to increase at 3 percent to adjust for inflation.

4. Sufficient net income is generated
during the planning horizon to support
all scheduled capital projects including
those eligible for FAA/TxDOT matching
funds.

5. The fund reflects two transfers, totaling $1,211,082. The first transfer of
$710,800 satisfies the debt service
obligation. This amount increases to
$711,000 for 2016-2018. These payments reflect the retirement of certificates of obligation that were sold to
finance construction of the Arts and
Events District. The second transfer
of the remaining $500,282 contributes
to Tourism efforts in the newly created
department in the Economic Development fund due to the elimination of the
Visitor Services department.

Utility Fund Long-Term Plan
Like the Airport Fund, the goal of the Utility
Fund’s plan is to generate sufficient revenues to support operating expenses as
well as to fund capital projects. Below are
features of the plan.
1. Operating revenues are determined by
the water and sewer rates as well as the
volume of water sold and sewer treated.
These revenues are highly influenced
by weather patterns. Hot, dry summers
result in high water sales which to a certain extent also generate higher sewer
revenues. Due to a reasonably precip-

6. The plan reflects revenues exceeding expenditures through fiscal year 2019 with
fund balance growing to $7,259,610 or
111.5 percent of operating expenditures
due to the fall off of debt. Unlike other
funds where expenditures are directly

Stormwater Fund Long-Term Plan

itous season and mild summer, utility
operating revenue for 2015 is estimated to be 4 percent more than generated
in 2014. This is directly attributable to a
2.44 percent increase by Dallas Water
Utilities for wholesale water costs, and
a 2.5 percent increase by Trinity River
Authority for wastewater treatment services. The long-term plan assumes that
for fiscal years 2016 through 2019, water sales will grow 3 percent per year
based on new residential and commercial development.

Similar to the Utility and Airport Funds, the
Stormwater Fund’s plan is to generate sufficient revenues to support operating expenses as well as to fund capital projects.
Features of the plan are as follows:
1. O
 perating revenue increased slightly in
2015 due to the increase of stormwater fees. For fiscal years 2016 through
2019 revenues are projected to increase each year based on Council-adopted fee schedule.

2. Operating expenses, dominated by payments to other entities for the purchase
of water and the treatment of sewage,
are expected to increase by an average
of 5 percent per year for water purchases and 2.5 percent for sewer services.
These assumptions are based on historical trends of the last five years.

2. Operating expenses for the 2015 budget
will be 33 percent greater than the 2014
budget, primarily due to expenses related to creating the new Stormwater operating department. Over the planning
horizon, expenses show a 3 percent increase to adjust for inflation.

3. From fiscal years 2015 through 2019,
net income is expected to average $1.2
million, which is needed to retire debt
principal and fund capital projects. This
is significantly lower than previous years
and is feasible because of the recent
debt service retirement.

3. From fiscal years 2015 through 2019,
net income is expected to average $1.5
million, which parallels the increases in
fees adopted by Council.
4. Uses of working capital are projected to
average $2,224,000 per year through
2019, and reflect the use of bond proceeds raised in 2013.

4. Debt service was reduced significantly
in 2014 due to the retirement of debt
that had been issued in the 1990’s. The
Town has issued approximately $7.5
million for the purpose of updating various infrastructure throughout the community.

The Government Finance Officers Association of the of the United States and Canada
(GFOA) presented a Distinguished Budget Presentation Award to the Town of Addison,
Texas, for its annual budget for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2013. In order to
receive this award, a governmental unit must publish a budget document that meets
program criteria as a policy document, as an operations guide, as a financial plan and as
a communications device.
The award is valid for a period of one year only. We believe our current budget continues
to conform to program requirements and we are submitting it to GFOA to determine its
eligibility for another award.
The Town was also awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial
Reporting by GFOA for its comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) for the fiscal
year ending September 30, 2013. The certificate is the highest form of recognition for
excellence in state and local government financial reporting.
Together the award and the certificate are evidence of the Finance department’s
dedication to producing documents which effectively communicate the Town’s financial
condition to elected officials, city administrators and the general public.
